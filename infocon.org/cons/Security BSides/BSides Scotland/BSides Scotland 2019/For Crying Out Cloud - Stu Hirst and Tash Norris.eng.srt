1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,939
excellent welcome this is awesome to

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:11,300
speak here this is my home city as most

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,710
of you know me no this is quite a tough

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,360
crowd to speak to about half the people

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,530
in the Bhrigu and that's a little bit

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,320
more difficult some phones than they're

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,119
speaking 200 strangers so I'm students

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,730
attached we both work at the photo box

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,250
group and we're going to give you a bit

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,509
of an insight into our whole world

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,489
really in some of the work that we've

12
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:33,140
done this organization and previous ones

13
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:35,090
it's some george's day today for the

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,100
english people in the room i'm Scotsman

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:40,490
describe the accent head-to-head with

16
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:48,079
women here so what does anybody really

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:52,220
even pay attention pension system Who am

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,500
I I aspired my security career at the

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:59,239
train line I say security is PCI

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,190
compliance and then I moved on to

21
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,779
Skyscanner so I guess people who know me

22
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,890
from up here is probably because of the

23
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,060
work I did at Skyscanner

24
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,440
and when capital 100 awhile in their

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,080
cyber leadership now on the first

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:17,780
abolishment citation and numerous others

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:19,100
I'm a public speaker I guess I've said

28
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,960
this in the last few talks I've done

29
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,280
these things are incredibly difficult to

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,630
do so anybody could get something talks

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,880
in front of rooms of people I have huge

32
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,929
respect for putting this content

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,399
together it takes time

34
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,400
they're nerve-racking things to do

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,460
respectful I'm one half of cyber

36
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,310
Scotland Connect that I've got a slide

37
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,320
after this if you can indulge me for for

38
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,420
just a minute on that and also

39
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,250
facilitating AWS security slack-jawed

40
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,340
which is close to the thousand members

41
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:49,310
now so if you're in cloud world as we

42
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:55,630
are want to learn more than please find

43
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:55,630
me on Twitter learn that

44
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,070
and for focus : connect is something

45
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,689
that Harry McLaren and I put together

46
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:07,008
than that Harry's and we've got some

47
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,929
awesome moderators as well of which

48
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:11,090
there are a few of them here today and

49
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,889
we're really an establishment that's

50
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,850
trying to bring communities in Scotland

51
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:15,680
together

52
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,660
regardless of what you might do or want

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,600
to do will be involved in we're trying

54
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,130
to bring a public sector private sector

55
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,200
together to facilitate events and

56
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,390
learnings training and all sorts of

57
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,399
other things it's very much a work in

58
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,929
progress and it's being driven by this

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,680
community of people so if you want to

60
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:41,240
know more these photos on on Twitter

61
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:42,650
computers individual first year I

62
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,660
recently changed roles so I'm now

63
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,420
leaving absent from our whole outside

64
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,670
option and which is pretty cool and I'm

65
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,980
also their kV from the London I was

66
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,410
bloomin and upset chapter she's really

67
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,090
excited with her launch event recently

68
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,470
you're in London regardless of what

69
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,750
gender you identify with you're more

70
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,640
than welcome to come and support us I'm

71
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,740
also on the review board for DEFCON

72
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,299
she's super cool developers treat your

73
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,820
questions in engineering conference and

74
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,860
happens worldwide and and then I do a

75
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,329
lot with I was in terms of contributing

76
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,520
to some of the threat modeling project

77
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,020
in CAD Street project I'm going to be

78
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,390
covering a little bit more on threat

79
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,830
modeling and the cloud security open

80
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,779
source project a little bit later and

81
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,490
talk and when I'm in key facing with a

82
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,800
hammer at Stu's gonna kick off the first

83
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,660
half of our journey and a throw butts

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,010
and and then I'm going to pick up the

85
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:38,870
second half and cover some of the

86
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:41,209
engineering sector we've done so I

87
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,460
joined photo box in May last year so

88
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,570
I've been there about a year

89
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,990
initially to head up some security

90
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:50,989
engineering work and then really my

91
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:53,540
first foray into AWS at this company was

92
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:58,310
helping moon peg who are one of our

93
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,870
company's transition into AWS I used AWS

94
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:04,580
a little bit previously but I'm by no

95
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,870
means an expert so my role kind of

96
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,270
shifted over that period of time and I

97
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,930
deliberately moved my role I I wanted to

98
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:13,970
move into cloud late late things and I

99
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,290
think one of the most important bits

100
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,108
about this piece of work was it was

101
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,480
really the first time company-wide that

102
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:23,090
somebody had had sat with these

103
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,470
engineering teams at the start or as

104
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,440
near to the start this journey

105
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:30,170
we could get customs and things I got

106
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,150
involved in security finds like

107
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,500
notoriously difficult to really embed

108
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,450
itself at the start of our journey we

109
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,510
normally come in way down the line or

110
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:41,030
far far further afterwards where we have

111
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,099
to then try and fix things or make ones

112
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,630
better so that was the kind of main main

113
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,940
piece of work that I that I got involved

114
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,500
in last year transitioning to the double

115
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,960
yes and I think one of the things that

116
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,790
struck me fairly quickly is when we're

117
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,500
not all Netflix we can't all be Netflix

118
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,090
straight away we don't all have security

119
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,320
engineering teams of different people

120
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:03,049
and huge budgets and turnovers to drive

121
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,460
that kind of work so you've got to start

122
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,010
somewhere and this these were some of

123
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,250
the things by I got involved with us

124
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,900
last summer and I was working so well

125
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,420
architected reviews so they're kind of

126
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,260
half-day sessions with AWS in their

127
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:20,930
offices really working through the whole

128
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,159
data flow and architectural setup of

129
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,150
what it is you trying to build and

130
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,740
they're great because you're working

131
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,349
with the organization that you've put in

132
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,210
your applications and things are in and

133
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,400
security is a big part of that and we

134
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,570
came away from that piece of work with

135
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,239
lots of things to look at and consider

136
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:39,200
that we may not have done have security

137
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,270
not be I then did a lot of manual

138
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,820
auditing of dev accounts and test

139
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,729
accounts not sexy stuff from Africa I

140
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,530
mean lots of going into the portal and

141
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,210
just manually looking at things and

142
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,950
trying to find little gaps or things

143
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,979
that I thought were wrong this is before

144
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,750
I got into any of the tooling or any of

145
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:59,360
the coolest stuff that attachment will

146
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,620
go on and describe and that was really

147
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,150
interesting that gave me more of an

148
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:07,280
insight into how some of these parts of

149
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:09,049
AWS work being the expert things like

150
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,059
setting up graphs or at least trying to

151
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,729
help teams make decisions on wax whether

152
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,960
that's AWS is native product or other

153
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,880
things on the market and then the

154
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,669
tooling the AWS provides and to start

155
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,229
duty it's really just being in that room

156
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:24,500
with people to help making more

157
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:26,060
facilitated decisions and we just

158
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,160
trusted advisor quite a lot so again

159
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,800
just making sure that that was where I

160
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,770
needed to be and happy with it their

161
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,130
compliance related things again nothing

162
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,780
really sexy but helping

163
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,150
you see I in making sure you're making

164
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,650
some good decisions and logging this

165
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,659
isn't that comes up quite a lot around

166
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,919
do you have a login for the various

167
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,110
parts of

168
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,470
[Music]

169
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,819
so like I said I changed my role in

170
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,650
about all the September time

171
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,240
deliberately hasn't asked anybody to do

172
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,438
it just decided that's what I was gonna

173
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,900
do I'm lucky enough to work an

174
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,430
organization that let them do that

175
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,810
I really didn't know where to start so

176
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,780
where do you start when you've taken on

177
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:09,900
a role to look after child security for

178
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,340
numerous brands and I went back to risk

179
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,539
doing what are the things that you're

180
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,750
concerned about when you're building

181
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:17,789
these technologies or data so I went

182
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:21,719
back to looking at risk and this is

183
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:22,680
nothing particularly funky but there's a

184
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:24,060
lot of good things out there that can

185
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,949
help with this I didn't reinvent the

186
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,389
wheel I didn't make up these strategies

187
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:29,069
these were these are things that I've

188
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:30,900
taken from things that already exist but

189
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:35,520
so things like the CIA's benchmarking

190
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,830
this aisaka cloud security alliance this

191
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,969
information is out there and don't use

192
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:43,020
it if you're on the journey into the

193
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:45,150
cloud organizations I've got a lot of

194
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,128
looking into CMAs recently and I think

195
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,270
there were as many benchmarking guys as

196
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:51,259
there are that they're there for all

197
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,900
sorts of things desktop apps Network

198
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:56,039
stuff for mobile devices not just cloud

199
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,020
and there are a really good set of

200
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,000
guidelines if if you can take anything

201
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,549
away from from this particular talk

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,169
other than cool stuff past days please

203
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,419
don't have a look at the CIA's per se is

204
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:09,979
benchmarking because they've certainly

205
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,979
about it very valuable for me involved

206
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,940
so what if I do I really just took

207
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,830
what's in the CIS benchmarking for AWS

208
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,080
and expanded on that latasha's helped

209
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,090
see and some of the things we already

210
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,890
knew as people who worked in the cloud

211
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,489
some of the things we potentially seen

212
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,930
in the industry or some incident

213
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,270
response things and tried to define

214
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:36,230
eight key areas and some of the risks

215
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:38,840
any business might have those things um

216
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:41,150
there's a list of them on my github get

217
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,800
it's nothing groundbreaking it's a start

218
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,470
in place if you don't know where to look

219
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,819
for a cloud risk if it'll give you under

220
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,980
those eight headings and things to think

221
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,530
about for those who saw this

222
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,740
besides Munich talk I've added a bit to

223
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,760
the content of this and these are some

224
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,800
of the things you can think about in

225
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,150
these areas and this is not just defined

226
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,859
to cloud this could be for any network

227
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,880
that you happen to to be in and it

228
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,040
certainly doesn't have to just be able

229
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,860
to death so things like DDoS and what

230
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,240
protection do you have do you have any

231
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,700
more layers do you have app you have

232
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,560
layer seven potential otters three four

233
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:17,330
and laughs are you using one the amount

234
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,150
of organizations I know that have last

235
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:27,230
don't have them in blocking mode they're

236
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:28,850
just their own data and logging are you

237
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:32,570
logging all the various aspects of your

238
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:34,880
cloud architecture decentralized those

239
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,030
to help with your soft teams or Incident

240
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,350
Response Teams and keys how are you

241
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:42,680
protecting them are you protecting them

242
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:44,780
are you rotating them how many more

243
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:50,870
incidents that we hear about publicly of

244
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:52,459
keys encryption need to think this this

245
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,320
is basic stuff these days and security

246
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,850
but it doesn't seem to be so you can

247
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:02,420
force encryption on everything enable

248
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:03,890
nest of certain extent s3 we're still

249
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,689
seeing a huge amount of incidents

250
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,930
industry-wide around openness through

251
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,640
buckets Tasha has got a great site I've

252
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,640
got most in their content or gray hat

253
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,500
and pretty welcome we have warfare where

254
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,780
you can go and search a public open s3

255
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:22,090
buckets of things like conventions dot

256
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:24,350
txt please don't use the feds cuz I

257
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,180
think that I am which is

258
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,040
identity and access management in Italy

259
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,079
less how permissive is that are you

260
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,189
giving people too much permission are

261
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,290
you removing it when they've left the

262
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,940
company as companies are finding that to

263
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,050
be a real challenge and then

264
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,920
vulnerability management things like

265
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,339
using up today

266
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,339
a Mis

267
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,640
now we're pretty agile tech business so

268
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,480
if we pick on JIRA I know everybody's

269
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,860
not super fun but we use it happily

270
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,020
it's pretty much the foundation of

271
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,690
everything we do within the team anybody

272
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,180
who sees our boss thinness talk he sees

273
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,250
massive on tracking things and JIRA and

274
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,569
mapping things in JIRA and all this very

275
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,720
clever kind of stuff

276
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:07,600
so what I did was I took those business

277
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,060
AWS risks by defying got them all into

278
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,790
JIRA to link into our other existing

279
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,319
risk management framework we allocate

280
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,719
management and technical odors and

281
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,310
stakeholders so that we can see how that

282
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,140
all those things are mapped together who

283
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,500
has a an input into that particular risk

284
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,439
fine

285
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,410
we then link those to our ok ours which

286
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,080
are our projects if you like all

287
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:33,699
projects as well and it really allows us

288
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,500
to define the pieces of work to then

289
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,750
reduce those risks nothing

290
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,970
groundbreaking but it's all done in JIRA

291
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,970
everything we track is in u.s. our

292
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,480
recently attached and I were in a same

293
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,459
team together that's that's moved on as

294
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,040
as companies tend to move quickly

295
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,780
Thurston's ahead of map search um but

296
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,180
the way we work or have been working is

297
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,760
extremely agile we were working in

298
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,170
two-week sprints initially where we

299
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,939
split our ok hours into those nice

300
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,849
management chunks from the master

301
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,230
sprints and then we see moving on things

302
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,360
quickly but we also brought other things

303
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,430
into that work tour as well so business

304
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,350
as usual requests from other areas in

305
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,020
the business for us to do work modeling

306
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,030
or risk assessments with more incident

307
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,910
in so we have an incident it came into

308
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,290
our sprint wall it then had a knock-on

309
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,930
effect of other work being pushed to the

310
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:26,459
sides but that we had a mechanism there

311
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,459
this is not our JIRA board by the way

312
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,250
[Music]

313
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,660
but it just gives us that mechanism to

314
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,850
see all the work that's in flow what's

315
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:37,959
being blocked what's been finished and

316
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:40,529
we can then show management and also

317
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:43,339
work requests and we have a service desk

318
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,140
created

319
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,050
so imagine Geordi one company is

320
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,930
easy-peasy isn't it no.11 company to

321
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:54,380
join fashion a fundamentally doing war

322
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:58,099
companies because we have four brands

323
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:00,050
there in AWS the five brands yeah

324
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,060
and I think one of the main things I've

325
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,189
personally found quite tricky is the

326
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,260
complexities of trying to manage cloud

327
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,589
security across fundamentally four

328
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,200
different companies different text acts

329
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,520
different programming languages this

330
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,180
crosses over into a lot of other areas

331
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,460
of security officers not just cloud how

332
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,140
do you get things in the CID Co ACD

333
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,650
pipeline when it's full different types

334
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:27,110
of codes or code bases you know things

335
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:30,589
like cultures sort of our businesses one

336
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:33,230
in Germany on France's language barriers

337
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:35,839
these are complexities of companies that

338
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,180
you have to think about into business

339
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,029
structures we've got multiple CC owns

340
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,589
multiple heads of and then people across

341
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,080
the leadership that we have to try and

342
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,820
convince and sit on the right boards and

343
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,860
certainly rightly things to influence

344
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,450
one of the things I kicked off recently

345
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,940
which I think has been super valuable is

346
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,770
an AWS kilns where I bring as many of

347
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,200
those people together in a room once a

348
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:58,130
month to talk about how we align is now

349
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,450
there are some things that we do

350
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,210
individually as companies but also

351
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:03,410
things an actor after be aligned and

352
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:07,160
you've got the four levels of knowledge

353
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,839
not just in businesses but in teams one

354
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,329
of the things I guess we found from some

355
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,339
of the brands here is lots of different

356
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,150
accounts across AWS that development

357
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:18,290
environments production environments

358
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,750
terraform versus cloud formation for

359
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,949
your infrastructure as code again these

360
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,330
have been different across and brands

361
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,780
and it's hard to find where that common

362
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:29,209
ground might be so lots of complexities

363
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:32,540
of trying to embed what we're doing

364
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:34,819
across customs burns now don't you if

365
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,819
you've seen this already was the most

366
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,070
important aspect of securing the cloud

367
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:50,930
but it wants to be brave enough to share

368
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:52,490
some no no Frisian so no I mean what's

369
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,079
the most important aspect of securing

370
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,590
that though something yeah yes

371
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,730
technically is power but there's a lot

372
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,960
there's not a right answer to this by

373
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,690
the way this is just them this is my

374
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,540
experience of poverty misery

375
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,160
so it's recruitment for me I think

376
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,360
recruitment is probably the most

377
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,350
important partner for the roles I've

378
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,940
been doing over the last few years

379
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,980
because if I don't have awesome people

380
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,720
who can help me do the work that I think

381
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,420
we need to do that work doesn't get done

382
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,480
so you can have all the cool tooling you

383
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,189
can try and get the where Netflix are on

384
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,470
want to automate everything and get into

385
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,930
this kind of cool compliances code world

386
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,280
but if you don't have people with users

387
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,439
it's go on our journey you're never

388
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,730
going to get there so to me that

389
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,500
continues to be the most important thing

390
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,000
and I would echo this for the whole

391
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,820
industry you're not just anything cloud

392
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,230
related through great people into your

393
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,850
organization using the chance to learn

394
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:45,680
they'll be the people at UAE so what I

395
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,010
learned it's been has been a pretty

396
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,500
crazy six seven eight months in a crazy

397
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,240
take business I guess your journey has

398
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,440
to start somewhere right if whether

399
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,730
you're building a security team from

400
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,790
scratch or you're doing something in our

401
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,350
world for the cloud or ews changing

402
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,930
their businesses takes with real time

403
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,880
and graft is a lot of effort it's a lot

404
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,370
of speaking to people standing firm on

405
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,450
the ground with teams lots of investment

406
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,710
in just pain no doubt about trying to

407
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,570
get those major stakeholders around the

408
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,730
table that's difficult as well that

409
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,620
Gilda I talked about as a commitment in

410
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,270
time for some of the most senior people

411
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,030
in the business or you know very

412
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:24,880
difficult to find time and their diaries

413
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:28,430
but it's been super valuable to get chat

414
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,710
conversation people repeat mistakes I'm

415
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:35,030
no different and with trying to find

416
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:36,680
ways to make that better cloud s complex

417
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,589
is difficult it's okay to admit that

418
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,020
it's difficult I think security as a

419
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:44,060
whole is difficult and as master mode

420
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,370
and recruitment is key right so most of

421
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,248
us might have taken away

422
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,529
that's just that to leave you with what

423
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:53,839
more sign after this this is me most

424
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:55,459
days of my career and I'm more

425
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,529
comfortable with putting this out there

426
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:58,878
and saying this to people people people

427
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:01,430
to know we personally know the imposter

428
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,379
syndrome thing but this is a lot of days

429
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,789
in my career where I don't really know

430
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:06,709
the right way to go but I'm trying

431
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:08,869
things I'm trying to research things and

432
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:11,089
trying to learn from other people either

433
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:13,129
in my organization or people like

434
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,539
yourselves in the room so it's okay to

435
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,279
admit that and I think we should get

436
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:18,260
more comfortable with about part of

437
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:21,169
security there's a vast field we're

438
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,179
trying to learn about just some things

439
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:24,470
that have helped other training

440
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,059
platforms are available but all this is

441
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,580
not our sales page turning these things

442
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,610
a cloud guru at the moment for me I'm

443
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,870
investing a lot of time in learning

444
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,309
[Music]

445
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,229
platform cyber e is really good because

446
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,240
it's free so if you want something where

447
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,370
you don't have to pay for

448
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,529
I watched loads of talks on YouTube I

449
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,209
don't get any strategic ideas I don't

450
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,200
just sit and they they come out of

451
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,669
nowhere

452
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,200
i watch talks from people from

453
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:51,260
organizations that fix these problems

454
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,480
and then I try and work some events and

455
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:56,529
Isis and dying I work I'd like to say it

456
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,000
was all my idea but it's really not it's

457
00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:00,169
SlideShare so coming to see these kind

458
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,179
of tools where any talks is really

459
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:03,950
valuable you'll take some some things

460
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:05,360
from it another thing would be less so

461
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,399
but the fact that people are willing to

462
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,779
do it put it all out on YouTube these

463
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:11,600
are all recorded these tools and

464
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:13,159
SlideShare you can go and research some

465
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,418
really really cool people in the

466
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:19,130
industry who help you in the policy so I

467
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,010
guess that's my that's my bear the talk

468
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:25,760
and I'll pass over to touch with her

469
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:28,580
insight into her world library that's

470
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,529
one of my favorite resources one visit

471
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,029
is free and but actually there's some

472
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:34,159
really great content on there and then

473
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:36,470
beside share I spy a game in such a

474
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,330
weird game certain au revoir my friends

475
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,760
book SlideShare karaoke at anything on

476
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,260
those web sites near karaoke and it's

477
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,059
quite often again what happens after

478
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,529
thunder like 2:00 a.m. when you've kind

479
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:47,799
of you need to get away from what you're

480
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:50,539
building with the idea is that you also

481
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,250
you basically get a random slide deck

482
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:53,170
from SlideShare and you have to jump

483
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,650
into the group

484
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:59,020
and had some really weird I had to

485
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:02,950
prevent my son cloud but not I felt like

486
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,510
like Nimbus cloud and that was I was

487
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,310
lucky my with quite safe

488
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,070
we're coming outside to present one they

489
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,840
were definitely not saying what they've

490
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,850
given so what I'm going to do is I'm

491
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,040
gonna cover up some of things that help

492
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,469
to build on top of a lot of these

493
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,330
foundations that you talked about to

494
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,940
start to kind of progress towards real

495
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,370
technical changes and how we are

496
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,340
starting to enable that we are by no

497
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,870
means a fully dev set up with the

498
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,419
organization and it's got everything

499
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,830
right but we're really on a journey and

500
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,620
some of the things that I'm gonna cover

501
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,629
actually and Seana is done a really good

502
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,340
job of almost laying some of the the

503
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,240
entry to those areas and I'm gonna dive

504
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,070
into from a slightly different

505
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,260
perspectives they should complement each

506
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,429
other quite well and it's worth there

507
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,470
and this isn't everything

508
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,420
I'm also quite active on Twitter and if

509
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,790
you're interested in when she talked

510
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:55,300
about the api's and are kind of the way

511
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:56,770
we use JIRA and I posted a taxonomy a

512
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,440
couple of days ago on Twitter where I

513
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:01,710
talked about how I create tasks and

514
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,870
derive those from objectives and

515
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,100
business priorities so these are some of

516
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,020
the things that I'm going to talk about

517
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,719
and the first thing I want to kind of

518
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,660
cover up and it's a level of empathy

519
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,540
really right which is there's a the idea

520
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:19,150
that as security people we cover so many

521
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:21,520
different aspects of security but it's

522
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,350
stopper engineers they've gone from

523
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,760
being software engineers all of a sudden

524
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,320
being full stack in the cloud right

525
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,840
there covering infrastructure

526
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,669
engineering they're right in Tara formal

527
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,159
confirmation whatever it is to deploy

528
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,650
databases and servers they become DBA

529
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,300
database admins so they've gone from

530
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,100
this one row of running their their one

531
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,169
thing to all of a sudden having to carry

532
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,879
all of these responsibilities at once

533
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,890
and I think one of the things that we

534
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,030
can do to make it easier beyond all

535
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,530
these technical things we're going to

536
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,660
talk about all these processes and

537
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,820
resources is the level of empathy for

538
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,140
engineers you have security people I

539
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,409
think have always had it pretty tough

540
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,540
then haven't

541
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,680
all these different thing right

542
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,920
engineers it's a real learning curve and

543
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,050
in the organizations that I've worked at

544
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,570
least I've seen how do anyone really

545
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:08,210
state engineer darlin say here's a 101

546
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:10,639
on being a DBA or here's a 101 on

547
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,440
infrastructure administration or

548
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,870
infrastructures appointment and I think

549
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,610
that a level of empathy will go a long

550
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,889
way and build in those relationships of

551
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,689
your talents so beyond that I want to

552
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:23,210
introduce my current security pyramid

553
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,610
scheme I've been warned about this slide

554
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,230
a couple times I once talked about my

555
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:32,510
pyramid scheme in the US so I put in my

556
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:34,160
Ponzi scheme someone took all of the non

557
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,200
of civil religion so this is my security

558
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,440
champions program the idea is that we

559
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,180
don't scale as true people so we want to

560
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,290
use our engineers to be our eyes and

561
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,660
ears or shatter them

562
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:47,149
Shanta that I had to be a middleman in

563
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,100
their team so a way to be a conduit

564
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:51,560
between a Stinnett engineering team

565
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,629
I call it my pyramid scheme the idea if

566
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,510
I can stick I can't put the top four

567
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:58,160
it's do and I can use those engineers to

568
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:01,190
then talk to more and more people and to

569
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,450
spread that message for me I'm not going

570
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,920
to go too much into this because some of

571
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,380
you would have seen it in your talk but

572
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,230
I do a lot around gamification training

573
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,090
resources and power more and one of the

574
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,760
things I'm really pushing is first true

575
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,939
champions to be part of our team's

576
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,140
objectives that way when they are

577
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,700
hosting whether they're hosting training

578
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,990
for their college or they're coming

579
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,150
along standing where the cameras

580
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,760
conferences if something they can talk

581
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,200
about with Olivia in their recaps of

582
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,610
their line management and something that

583
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,890
can help you help them progress in their

584
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,479
career we're still very much on a

585
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,880
learning curve for security champions

586
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,620
when I joined a probox there are a lot

587
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,110
of people that have been voluntold

588
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,820
I had to be security champion they'd

589
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,159
rather in volunteering for the program

590
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:46,129
some of it just shove them forward you

591
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,230
don't know and and you'll see a real

592
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,270
difference when that happens in your

593
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,460
engagement levels so we worked really

594
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,950
hard to make it a reward a thing for

595
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,480
people to be a part of and being part of

596
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,950
their objectives I'm hoping all day long

597
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,990
we're also become providing a lot of

598
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,000
feedback so some cell line managers and

599
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,890
really encouraging people to be a part

600
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,120
of it and some of the things that we're

601
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,750
looking at doing a high some things I

602
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,479
capture the flag events where

603
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,400
and we use things like OS top ten and we

604
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,680
get our champion in a room and we get

605
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,420
them to try and break into these website

606
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,430
try and find some flags and my dearest

607
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,780
to to reaffirm the things that we're

608
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,310
talking about by actually perhaps if

609
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,320
you're doing something the game of fire

610
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,270
make it exciting and interesting for

611
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,040
them and so there's a whole load of

612
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,510
different stuff on that the one thing I

613
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,790
kind of mentioned before is it doesn't

614
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,950
always go right about it so in being

615
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:33,540
able to change your program one thing

616
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,370
that works and one company might not

617
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:38,220
work another I came from financial

618
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:40,800
services with a very largely distributed

619
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,750
organization across the US and the UK

620
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,000
no multiple American and Canadian

621
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,470
offices and what we found with the

622
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,390
secure Campion's program there is we

623
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:51,030
couldn't have one Scindia program we

624
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:53,130
almost had to have like factions across

625
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,330
the different areas and they had some

626
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,930
common goals but they were mostly

627
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:59,429
autonomous and we're a photo books even

628
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,710
though we brought multiple brands and

629
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:03,360
we've we've got five in total and we

630
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,710
found that it's much easier to have that

631
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,679
one program because the way the

632
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,510
organization's out so the other thing

633
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,220
that I've been doing a lot of and for

634
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,500
those that follow me on Twitter or see

635
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,690
me at other talks this is my thing I

636
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,580
love talking about Brack modeling if

637
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,250
something we already do you don't know

638
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,500
about it if you think about I'm parking

639
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,760
your car in a weird dark alley you're

640
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,070
already thinking about the things that

641
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,200
can go wrong one of my favorite stories

642
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:29,399
on this exam I like to say that my

643
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,190
husband should do a little bit more

644
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,840
threat modeling and he he when he wanted

645
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,430
surprise to me we were flying to South

646
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,889
Africa and he had the ring in his pocket

647
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:39,450
and we're going through airport security

648
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,730
and he was like in really nervous and a

649
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:44,160
bit intense and like oh man I might just

650
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,420
relax I just just London Airport

651
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,700
Security's not like they're gonna go

652
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,470
right up in there or anything just chill

653
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,420
out a little bit and here's I can't no

654
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,890
no no I'm just just I'm really excited

655
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,840
to go home I'm like all right

656
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,910
and I didn't realize yet a ring in his

657
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,080
pocket and if we got absolute security

658
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,570
and they're really patting people down

659
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,870
he looks at me and he says I'll race ya

660
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,490
I am really competitive and I'd like

661
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,739
fits of strength but more often than not

662
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:10,170
I will push people out of my hair to get

663
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,580
somewhere so he says you'll race me I

664
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,380
put security the first thing I do is I

665
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,419
look at him I leave him some bags and I

666
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,250
just walk kind of it's fast but like

667
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,240
also not so fast to draw attention to

668
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,860
myself away from him

669
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,940
and after court security ages so I can't

670
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,530
get through and I get through to the

671
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,210
other side and I'm right there ten

672
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,790
minutes before he is I've made sure I

673
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,520
picked the right huge there's no crumbs

674
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:32,110
in front of me or for anyone that would

675
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,050
slow me down because I have no empathy

676
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,459
when I'm in a competition and I get

677
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:38,340
through and I'm not you so did it and he

678
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,870
gets through the side walls sweating so

679
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,780
yeah I'm okay all right well it's wrong

680
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:45,340
and I found out a couple days later and

681
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,290
he proposed it's mostly it will time in

682
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:49,600
person he decided he was gonna do it and

683
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,129
rather than an airport security but one

684
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,929
of the things that struck me was he

685
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,160
hadn't really thought about some of the

686
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,860
things that could go wrong it was a

687
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,720
natural thing for him whereas I thinking

688
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,120
security it's really easy for us to

689
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,310
constantly be thinking about hey what

690
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,080
can go wrong and how will that go wrong

691
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:07,419
what can I do to mitigate that what can

692
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,040
I do to get around it so now I felt for

693
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,430
him because he wasn't the BAPS for the

694
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,649
room in the suitcase could bypass him as

695
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:16,570
we do and literally it was an

696
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,070
interesting challenge and I think when I

697
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,990
start to talk about threat modeling with

698
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,149
engineering teams the thing I start to

699
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,360
think about is think about the value the

700
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,500
the reason you're doing what you do and

701
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,260
dreams I always told you know you're

702
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,850
building this for optimization or and to

703
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,350
fix reliability or to make it more

704
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,120
secure that's not what gets credit

705
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,580
Sanders going it's about features and

706
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,320
value so while I start to do is to

707
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,850
change that conversation which is rather

708
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,340
than always talking about what can go

709
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:44,500
wrong plus two perspectives what removes

710
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,659
the value of what you're doing so what

711
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,570
takes that value away and then it

712
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:51,100
becomes a much easier conversation in

713
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:53,320
things that I've been playing around

714
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,760
with is how we take that threat modeling

715
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,080
and that traditional kind of long

716
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,330
processes go through these four

717
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,889
questions and which is one of many

718
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,260
methodologies it's just the one that I

719
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,450
prefer and fitting that into the

720
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,680
software development lifecycle so where

721
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:07,720
we've got teams working agile

722
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,030
methodologies making sprint PI or

723
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,590
stand-ups they don't really have time

724
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,240
for a long time modeling session

725
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,100
so we've playing around with how we

726
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,630
break this down so that when teams are

727
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,040
in a stand up and they're talking about

728
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,900
a new feature that gonna start working

729
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,490
on you can quickly go round as a group

730
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,020
and say what remove some value is that

731
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:24,880
what will just stop that working the way

732
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,010
I want it to work it's still something

733
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,570
we're trying at the moment and I'm going

734
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,158
to show you in a couple of slides

735
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,500
one of my new tools that I've been

736
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,779
working on that I'm hoping to release

737
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,549
open-source in a couple of weeks and

738
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:38,159
that I'm using to make this process a

739
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:40,269
little bit easier for cloud environments

740
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,919
these are the four questions I work

741
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:43,929
through when I do a threat model they're

742
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,370
really simple but again when I'm short

743
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,990
on time or when I'm struggling to get

744
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,239
that message with teams I go back to

745
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,830
this what would remove the value of what

746
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,690
you're doing and that's based on a

747
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:55,418
methodology by a guy called AV Dublin

748
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:57,580
who is that I was Tel Aviv chapter lead

749
00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:59,529
and he's also really active on tubes out

750
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,240
and that I was slack and which if you

751
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:04,509
want to link to it the end let me know

752
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,460
and I'll G up so the next thing I want

753
00:28:04,509 --> 00:28:08,169
to talk about and listen my other

754
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,659
favorites to test which actually also

755
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:12,519
spoke about and my challenge is no one

756
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:14,259
reads a security policy right even if

757
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:15,850
you have them and let's be realistic

758
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:18,639
them come isn't even have security

759
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,168
policy I am a security standards is when

760
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:23,199
people do write them they seem to just

761
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:24,490
buy these vault thunders and then just

762
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,009
throw them at their engineers they end

763
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,649
up with you like 45 page documents with

764
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:31,360
really complex wording in them and it

765
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:33,309
might not even be completely relevant to

766
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,049
what you're doing and what I found in a

767
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:37,149
couple of companies I worked at is that

768
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:39,908
no one is reading them and realistically

769
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:42,758
like no one cars so I've been looking at

770
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:43,960
writing tests and I've been trying some

771
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:45,549
of the stuff that shown to fight as well

772
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,830
which is like a really short test things

773
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:50,289
like regular expressions that we'll

774
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,658
check they're not about to commit github

775
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:54,399
keys to keys it'll get used to github

776
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:56,649
which there we've seen a lot of

777
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,908
companies do a lot of times and the

778
00:28:56,649 --> 00:29:00,549
other thing I've been working on and

779
00:28:57,909 --> 00:29:03,009
with the cloud stereos project our BDD

780
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:05,408
test this is behavior driven development

781
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:08,019
and the idea is we provides two tops in

782
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:11,710
human readable language so your product

783
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:14,500
owners your risk managers your keethy

784
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:16,059
iegai whoever that is or whatever and

785
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,519
you're a kind of compliance team looks

786
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:20,139
like can contribute to these types of

787
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:22,059
tests and then we have a Python library

788
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:23,350
that effectively convert that and that's

789
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:24,970
one of things I'm working on the moment

790
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,769
is how I create that library to then

791
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,899
apply this to terraform scripts or

792
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:31,299
confirmation scripts so rather than

793
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:32,678
using it with CLI tools to look at

794
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:34,899
what's currently deployed in your cloud

795
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:37,870
infrastructure how can I embed this into

796
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:39,370
the SPLC so that I mean highly our teams

797
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,889
are interested in reading your script

798
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,409
policy

799
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:44,540
but realistically we're being honest and

800
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:47,300
not and so how do I alternate that and

801
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,129
my other kind of favorite idea from this

802
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,990
is when you come to peace life

803
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:53,180
certification you don't actually have to

804
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,770
do a whole lot of talk into auditive you

805
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,380
can just run through the f-feel things

806
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,340
just run through your pipeline and

807
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,150
hopefully everything will pass and you

808
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,980
can generate some quantifiable

809
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:06,530
documentation a test view or a PDF basis

810
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,360
or your security stated and obviously

811
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:10,670
that's a long-term goal by no means

812
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,379
fully automating that and but it's

813
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:14,150
something that I'm really really

814
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,650
passionate about the Mellon my other

815
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,970
kind of idea to take some of our

816
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,950
security standard things like oh I

817
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,960
stopped and that our server list hopped

818
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:24,430
head and start to write those his tests

819
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,480
as well so the other piece is around

820
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,860
elevation of privilege card games this

821
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,780
is one of the ways that I just put my

822
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,219
threat models and this comes back to

823
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,730
that game of buying the security

824
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,600
champions and with engineering teams the

825
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,240
elevation of privileged prizes in the

826
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,399
open-source tool set from Microsoft you

827
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,690
can find out on github and I'll I'll

828
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,680
have a list of all the resources that

829
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:48,290
covered at the end and these are a card

830
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:51,230
deck I think right 75 or 80 old cards in

831
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:52,129
there and have sample threats against

832
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,260
your infrastructure

833
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,480
I know these cards have been around for

834
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,010
a really long time they are very good

835
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,420
but again some of the language and some

836
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:02,330
of the tool sets and the text fact that

837
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,400
it talks about are and we know we know

838
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:07,879
technology moves really fast right some

839
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:10,490
of them are unfortunately a little bit

840
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,930
vintage and I used to work at Apple and

841
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,760
anything older than five years was

842
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:16,570
considered vintage Apple and then to

843
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,770
hurt me a little head and I

844
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:20,389
unfortunately is that subscribe to some

845
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,610
of the Pisan set however it's still an

846
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,960
incredibly useful tool and it's

847
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,580
something I found really awesome all

848
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,630
teams you can gain the by it's there is

849
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,580
an actual game where you can play

850
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,530
threats against their designs or their

851
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,570
infrastructure you can pull out the

852
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,620
threats it is higher than when you're

853
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,870
doing a threat model using something

854
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,580
like this because these teams they work

855
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,780
on this product for a long time or

856
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,370
they've just got this design and they've

857
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,810
got friend new idea and you're

858
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,000
effectively bringing them into a room

859
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:45,950
and you're kind of taking a crack

860
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,800
powerful child they've just built and

861
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:50,630
rest a little time in to and but

862
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,220
actually the more you frame it and you

863
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,950
can

864
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:56,560
a muscle that needs to be exercised and

865
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,790
built app and it gets become a really

866
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,080
engaging and really interesting

867
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,510
team-building exercise with your

868
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,270
engineers so I decided to take this a

869
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:05,740
bit further because Kings really

870
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:08,170
responded to having these cards in

871
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,000
threat models and phrases start here we

872
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,830
work with them the OS how project he

873
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,420
built an Alexis skill for the student

874
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:16,360
they hey Alexa give me an elevation

875
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,770
privileged rep and society to evolve

876
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,000
this and take it a bit further to kind

877
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,790
of bring a little bit more relevance

878
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,500
back to what teams are doing and I set a

879
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:25,330
little bit of fun and these cars

880
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,790
security pads they're not launched yet

881
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,110
and hope to develop engines out and I

882
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,760
really wanted to work in a Star Trek

883
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:33,659
gift because as we waiting in Star Wars

884
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,160
that either than I'm a long truffle and

885
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,980
so these are the car departs so these

886
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,880
are hopefully gonna be anything so soon

887
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,470
providing I can actually finish working

888
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,900
with them so if you want to continue

889
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:45,070
more have a malcolm and these are taking

890
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,600
a lot of the threats that we see in

891
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,669
there are the ones and the news but also

892
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,320
some other stuff that we've seen from

893
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:52,870
various companies and i've got a little

894
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,240
yes time support in as well and i'm i've

895
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:57,280
done is i try to rewrite these isms and

896
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,990
threats against new environment the idea

897
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,430
is as a team you can either play the

898
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,230
full game or you can just grab some

899
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,520
cards and you can look at your design or

900
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:05,500
you can look at what you're building or

901
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,810
even what you've already built so any

902
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,610
stage in the SCLC and you can start to

903
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,960
play these cards again so you can read

904
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:12,909
through very mature as you're kind of

905
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,280
thinking about the feature that you want

906
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,720
to wear come with the idea that can help

907
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,010
guide and give you a bit more

908
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,100
information about what it is you're

909
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:23,770
building my aim of the abstract team of

910
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,540
once you can beat soon-to-be to is that

911
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:27,340
a lot of the questions that we get from

912
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,850
teams can be answered either through

913
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:32,409
automation or through and good tooling

914
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:35,919
or supports that I can spend more time

915
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:38,440
on there and more in each question the

916
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,730
design you have to touch advise so I

917
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,200
want to get to a point where we can

918
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,360
start giving advice the teams when they

919
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,620
think have got this crazy new language

920
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,939
and I wanna whack and they actually

921
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,919
that's great I've already been thinking

922
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,260
about that and I want to be able to

923
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,180
shift the focus we've got on firefight

924
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,070
into that kind of more proactive defense

925
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,020
than hindsight they serve your way of

926
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,820
doing that into teams on hands that are

927
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,010
in their security and their assessment

928
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,939
of the project they're working on that's

929
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,600
a cloudy cut

930
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,000
hopefully coming soon

931
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,459
so here they run down of some of my

932
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,069
favorite tools that I've been using so

933
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:12,649
and some haven't talked about here and

934
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:14,599
they've been incredibly helpful as I am

935
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:16,159
making my last command as I join photo

936
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:19,069
backs which I've been for about three

937
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,369
months now and how custodian inverse

938
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:24,349
service I'm automated I guess the

939
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:26,089
Ratan's to treat configuration detection

940
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:28,550
tool but you can use it prevention too

941
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:30,980
and I always think how custodian gets a

942
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,480
bit snarky because you can you can

943
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,520
configure it so it just ungenial and

944
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,740
says hey by the way your s3 bucket is

945
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,929
along Turtles and or you can configure

946
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:41,199
it so it's okay by the way rusty bucket

947
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:43,849
is more cryptic though I deleted it and

948
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,439
everything inside it and you can do some

949
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:47,210
really cool stuff of carcass idioms to

950
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,010
kind of make it a little bit more

951
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,079
preventative and when I think that I've

952
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,119
been looking at is when I look at my aw

953
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:54,379
stay and I gave through from non

954
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,290
production environment all the way

955
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:58,970
through to people I work with how I how

956
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,770
I start to change the configuration of

957
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,500
those tools for Cal custodian to get

958
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:05,270
right more and more smokey as you kind

959
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,119
of move up that compliance scale in a

960
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,410
production pail and I have a security

961
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:11,170
monkey on there I've got a national

962
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,578
security monkeys and Netflix cool and

963
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:17,480
hands up if anyone's ever considered a

964
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:20,329
Netflix security tool yeah it was really

965
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,190
awful and try not to swear too much oh

966
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:25,250
my god it was the worst thing I've ever

967
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,690
had to configure in my life and that

968
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,960
makes make some really great tools they

969
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:31,520
make an awful documentation and they

970
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,710
also do some really neat things like

971
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,450
never update their tool sets though a

972
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,310
lot of their dependencies will be

973
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,649
updated over time but their tool set is

974
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:41,390
in and they don't

975
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:42,560
dependants little pin any versions and

976
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,598
you shouldn't really from a security

977
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,040
perspective and this is kind of my run

978
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:48,170
it's pretty monkey actually has a lot of

979
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,990
vulnerable dependency which they've not

980
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:52,579
addressed or not the really annoying and

981
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:54,109
it's a good tool for kind of looking at

982
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:57,589
this true configuration of your estate

983
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:58,460
but my goodness hard way and so yeah

984
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:01,549
that's there's some really interesting

985
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,920
ones that and how they're I think I've

986
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,810
got on there yeah parlor scouts you are

987
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,670
again some free open-source tool so all

988
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:09,950
of these are open sourced by the way and

989
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:12,770
that's a really kind of big piece for me

990
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:14,859
at the conference is is very interesting

991
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:17,670
introducing tools I'd love to kind of

992
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:20,260
pretty open sores and say Oh cam and so

993
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:23,530
Prowler and scouts me again our tools

994
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,880
that you can use with the awl Isis I'm

995
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,260
your infrastructure and that probe Emery

996
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,970
but if you can straight configuration

997
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,650
and then the class through it was a

998
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:31,779
project at the end which is beauty d or

999
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,980
to make it ten the cloudy cards there

1000
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,780
and have an official projects at the

1001
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,250
moment I'm still work trying to work out

1002
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,170
the best web shooters on the Creative

1003
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,150
Commons they will be open source they

1004
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,450
will be soon and your best bet is to

1005
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:46,690
follow me on Twitter shameless perk and

1006
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:49,750
at Tashlin are and or jingles in

1007
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:51,160
business yep and you'll be able to get

1008
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,410
from them both those as soon as they go

1009
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,680
live or just my head left onto project

1010
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:58,810
those are my favorite tools and there's

1011
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,419
a QR code here for the aw screw slack

1012
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:04,000
forum and the biggest piece that I would

1013
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,560
love to leave you guys with is there's a

1014
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,180
lot of stuff that I've not taught on

1015
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,380
here in your before ma but that's really

1016
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,750
key that's something that I love and

1017
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,220
that's something I use or your kind of

1018
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,290
biggest iterative it would be to

1019
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:17,339
contribute back to the community whether

1020
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:19,210
it's a wasp or bee size or other

1021
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,310
initiatives as I'll say the many hat

1022
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:23,320
Club and come and ask them about it but

1023
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,970
some of the interest you and would be to

1024
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:28,540
continue back whether its blog post

1025
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:30,490
blogs videos and speaking and we're

1026
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,050
always looking for people to open source

1027
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:35,879
for rules for projects more stuff we're

1028
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,880
working on and that's it

1029
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:58,200
[Music]

1030
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,880
so there's a lot of great content there

1031
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,169
abide enabling like Claude environments

1032
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,230
and like to make them compliant didn't

1033
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:06,540
make them truly secure but is like would

1034
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,310
you say and they were like securing AWS

1035
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,500
and my client environments is not easier

1036
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:11,670
than on Prem do you think like with all

1037
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,740
these tools and with all these like

1038
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:16,440
great I like mamasan services does it

1039
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:21,959
get easier or is it still just as if not

1040
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:24,300
more difficult I think it's more visible

1041
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,640
I think use pretty fun abilities and

1042
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:31,380
what you can do about them is way more

1043
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,180
obvious or serious and in some ways I

1044
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,570
think it's a lot harder because you go

1045
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,350
from an on-premise Kingdom expose by

1046
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,000
default

1047
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,920
you've got like that additional layer in

1048
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,200
terms or to make your network

1049
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,760
segregation whereas natal be like to

1050
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,830
make things super easy for people you

1051
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,450
have it oh yes this is really cool thing

1052
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:51,810
where they make everything of it by be

1053
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:54,899
hard or it really annoys me and time

1054
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:57,900
yeah my personal perspective is higher

1055
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,880
in a way that it's more visible and so

1056
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,350
you know I feel like it's easy it's how

1057
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,370
what you should get out of this very

1058
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,770
good sir

1059
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:06,839
I'm a Hollywood actor a licensed service

1060
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:09,210
and the size about the treatment I'm

1061
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,220
finding cloud security recruitment

1062
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:14,580
harder than spirit mature really lucky

1063
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:16,560
to incite action policies I've learned a

1064
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,880
huge amount but I'm under no illusion

1065
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,470
that they want to choose among people

1066
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,140
with that level of knowledge at this

1067
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,549
point in their career so finding that

1068
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,700
talent come in and help me on that

1069
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:28,740
journey is Mark said go start somewhere

1070
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,500
and even if it's learning yourself I

1071
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,149
would I say AWS is harder to secure yeah

1072
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,700
anything that knowledge from the view as

1073
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,320
opposed to Proctor as a fame as an issue

1074
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:40,790
this is the networking something else is

1075
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:44,210
there so it's a lot of premises that say

1076
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:47,300
yeah including the anything to help you

1077
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,300
thank you

Thank You REE good talk I've used AWS

1080
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:10,000
heavily and used the wealth aspects of

1081
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:16,150
it to secure casino wife only plugs into

1082
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,730
it load balancer or CDN basically if you

1083
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,320
use the tops you could buy one from like

1084
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,210
sofas and stuff which don't tell the

1085
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,210
rules they used which is really easy to

1086
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:26,680
bypass and throw them on that ball so

1087
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:28,750
are you guys personally for example

1088
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:33,490
maybe is that we shared out now do you

1089
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:36,760
guys used a third part that Palo Alto in

1090
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:41,169
the wife section marketplace in AWS or

1091
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,940
do you guys just use custom use the very

1092
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,740
basically top warps free version they

1093
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,500
just add your own careers into it

1094
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:49,180
because I know if you use like a lot or

1095
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,210
it could be very expensive because it

1096
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:54,430
scales out if you if you attacked by

1097
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:57,040
some egos or something and if you have

1098
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,899
like kind of a thirty instances of a lot

1099
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:03,970
of running it could cost you like a lot

1100
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:06,700
of money so just a question of how you

1101
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,990
guys utilize in the wash um so first off

1102
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:12,460
its can be quite difficult so quite

1103
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:15,328
specific using happily have a private

1104
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:18,640
conversation with your afterwards well

1105
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:19,990
and I think from what I've seen in the

1106
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,799
custom roll shots which in the bio

1107
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:26,529
marketplace concentrated and a lot of

1108
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:32,079
time to cross see one is that they do so

1109
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:37,800
they're taking two I was taking Li

1110
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,800
difficult as my inability to see

1111
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:48,509
Malaysian was keeping that previous

1112
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:53,589
experience and Martina

1113
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:55,930
yes I I there's still a challenge for

1114
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:59,020
some of the web companies to really

1115
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:00,879
embrace cloud and services especially so

1116
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,430
you'll see a lot they say we're embedded

1117
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,490
in the ami you're like that's great I

1118
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:08,799
don't have anything and so their search

1119
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,779
engine things like auto scaling license

1120
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,160
releasing in terminate mrs. Andry

1121
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,720
business and some of them take 30

1122
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,690
minutes to release a license which is

1123
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,799
not variable in the PAL and some are

1124
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:21,810
making the real journey you've shown

1125
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:24,100
talked about mud set on the street and I

1126
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:25,450
spent a lot time helping the fella be

1127
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,700
open source projects that put that

1128
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,919
overhead was insane and any company I

1129
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:33,069
know that is lost three have full-time

1130
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:36,300
people on their black ops just overall

1131
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:38,350
configuration which is mentally and so

1132
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,540
probably better to catch at this dude

1133
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:42,040
and a couple of tips on the threat

1134
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,900
modeling he's using laughs make sure you

1135
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,350
the end points of cover to make sure you

1136
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:49,060
know and how to turn a rule art if you

1137
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:51,880
get a lot of possible since those will

1138
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:54,250
just read is a flood changing I'm just

1139
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:58,740
absolutely validate that they are able

1140
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:58,740
to do things like scaling and licensing

1141
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:15,449
[Music]

1142
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:20,740
great talk

1143
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,290
so I guess cloud myself it's been out

1144
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:25,060
for a while now

1145
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:30,880
have you seen some maturity of all

1146
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:32,860
variety in that are things improving no

1147
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,530
set myself up for it I would love to do

1148
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,760
a demo video of a great hot water for

1149
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:39,730
next time I'm

1150
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:43,540
I would go to UM if grey hat warfare

1151
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:45,280
calm turn illegal website tell eagle and

1152
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,830
what you do next is up to you search

1153
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,900
credentials stop CFD those the linear'

1154
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:51,160
with AWS silver that is the potential

1155
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,230
value get and generate native this

1156
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:56,440
active cute and use with you as you cook

1157
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:59,740
you and see how many ones also are and I

1158
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,500
think it's a lot and you get that four

1159
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:04,180
million bucket back and they all have

1160
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,770
some of those delete files that just

1161
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:08,470
been cached by our girlfriend but at

1162
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,970
some of them are valid credentials that

1163
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,620
are valid for a little bit environment

1164
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:13,509
not that I've tried always get

1165
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:17,200
permission before you try these consoles

1166
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:19,210
if they don't blow to you and so no I

1167
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,649
think we're still seeing a lot of puppet

1168
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:22,780
buckets I think a lot of people relying

1169
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:25,510
on the obscure URLs to protect public

1170
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:27,970
objects this great out were clarified

1171
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:31,030
open open source will show you that's

1172
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:33,490
absolutely not true and I think that

1173
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:35,950
there are so many simple mistakes made

1174
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:38,770
that a lot of the really cool Street

1175
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:40,689
innovation and screwed architecture

1176
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:44,140
seems like zero test Network people

1177
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:45,760
invested in you seem lost through every

1178
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,080
committee of iron policies and openness

1179
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,480
through buckets and it comes back to

1180
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,799
that when we move to the cloud and we

1181
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,320
have these kind of on-premise

1182
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,690
infrastructure it was not really easy to

1183
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,250
secure bit easier in a way when we move

1184
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,800
the crowd there was a lot of default

1185
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:02,200
open by open by default and that's just

1186
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,330
making way more of a pain I think it's

1187
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,009
gonna take a while and I think it really

1188
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:08,020
involves senders making lots of changes

1189
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,550
to their default configuration to get

1190
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,350
rid of some of these simple some of the

1191
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:13,690
leave then I think we'll city of

1192
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:15,850
accidents habits change in the credit

1193
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:17,560
card so if you run around how comes

1194
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,480
subdomain take events which is a really

1195
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,670
nice Neela's hat that it'll be

1196
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,770
especially we can need fake and that was

1197
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:26,440
a little cool one it was really easy

1198
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:27,730
using feelings configuration to overtake

1199
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,630
other people's websites I'll just

1200
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:33,400
sitting on insulin I said and so there

1201
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:37,180
are some really cool new attacks coming

1202
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:39,430
out but very immature

1203
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:40,839
yeah I mean there's a competitor that's

1204
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:42,490
getting worse because of organizations

1205
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:44,319
having to file what is there more

1206
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,359
information out there yes and we will

1207
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,579
commence fixing those problems certainly

1208
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:51,009
in certain places might need to go to to

1209
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:52,420
the idea of what helps do but I think

1210
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:54,279
you'll see it continues to get worse

1211
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,529
it's just a microcosm of the rest of the

1212
00:45:54,279 --> 00:45:58,450
security industry for me where more

1213
00:45:56,529 --> 00:46:00,099
companies are starting to have to invest

1214
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:04,058
in these things and probably given

1215
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:05,650
different as every organization just one

1216
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:08,020
if you think the organization isn't or

1217
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:12,150
won't it will because it's unruly and

1218
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:12,150
then he'll just come with complexities

1219
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,720
that's just them this is shameless

1220
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,020
probably Tasha's back in Edinburgh

1221
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:24,700
towards the end of May with matters

1222
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:33,430
sunstone connect events winter here

1223
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:34,359
again please measure yeah thank you very

1224
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:38,788
much

1225
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,789
[Applause]
