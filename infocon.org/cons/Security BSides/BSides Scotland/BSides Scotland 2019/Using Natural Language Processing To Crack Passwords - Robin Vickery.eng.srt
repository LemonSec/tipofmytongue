1
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:11,200
right hello everybody my name is Robin

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:15,940
Vickery and this is using natural

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,130
language processing to track password on

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,020
set for the victory I'm a penetration

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:24,189
tester and I work for a company called

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:27,180
Collison and I like sailing pen testing

7
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:27,180
do two things

8
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:33,610
Tolleson are small pen testing companies

9
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:37,089
were pasted over in these check writing

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:39,820
objects code and build reviews Wi-Fi

11
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:41,739
testing mobile application testing you

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,809
have application testing and external

13
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:52,780
pen testing and it's the last two that

14
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:54,730
identity so how I came up with this is a

15
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,629
half-baked idea that I'm sorry turn into

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:03,370
a presentation like all updates ideas

17
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:05,259
it's stopped out of our problems the

18
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,630
problem is basically I coached her from

19
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,550
and is a pen tester at line you know

20
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,550
arts nothing about your business

21
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:21,420
area businesses Preston and volcano in

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:28,079
fear that business part I'm inspected

23
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:32,100
strongest a password in name so just

24
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:34,860
have an example of what a typical shop

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,658
for us to be right and have a country

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:42,170
called examples on that which is an

27
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:44,789
international community and I know

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:47,429
they've booked an internal next channel

29
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:50,280
pentest some are doing excellent test

30
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:54,989
photography to engines anyone narration

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:59,280
president so two weeks before the test

32
00:01:54,989 --> 00:02:08,549
drops the peasants much ugly and all I

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:10,378
see is and about serious concerns the

34
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:13,920
project initiation document this is what

35
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:18,090
soldiers that opinion and slowly project

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,988
raspberry you see what we're not

37
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:25,440
contesting so I am I finished insistence

38
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:27,209
sorry too lazy bug and then for the next

39
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,790
couple beachside but it had my name is

40
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:32,040
unlocking another project and so it

41
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:37,500
certainly be tested before adding such

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:42,959
as attach it in the freezer Brad and on

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:47,069
the time I didn't know he's a bit more

44
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:52,920
about company 90 companies you only 32

45
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:57,510
you know justice and also misery so here

46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,738
we've got is / 16 about this such a 50%

47
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,719
[Music]

48
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:06,239
and popular website so I respond

49
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:12,810
audience because and realized it was

50
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:16,859
such a new series so next step is check

51
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:20,879
out complete website children identify

52
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:22,829
an opportunity named it out and you can

53
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:33,569
password wants to see what we find

54
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:38,519
and then I look at any proper related

55
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:46,018
sites I can find so the organization

56
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:49,219
issues Federation Federation on just

57
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:54,930
basically making a history it is

58
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:59,459
confronting national silent instruction

59
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:03,540
and ironies contact our initiations and

60
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:05,699
you didn't see interpreter and it turns

61
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,109
out the discussion is improvisation

62
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:13,239
Rosina so in perpetuity session today

63
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,239
[Music]

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,329
the world sizes actually efficient

vessels at sea

66
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:25,069
so you drop that out of your scope and

67
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:28,139
replace it with one missing job and then

68
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:34,560
there's a critical system that you

69
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:36,419
wanted to see 3-pack numeration dns

70
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,129
enumeration what's going on abyss

71
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,919
carrying that much captures all those it

72
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:45,419
started off and then while I'm waiting

73
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:49,068
for is to completely start covering

74
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:54,690
information password happiness so scan

75
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:56,639
websites been using cruel go to know

76
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:00,900
when slightly screwed that and take that

77
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:06,740
this ice buildup mister dictionary this

78
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:08,758
definitely and I combined that with any

79
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,629
knowledge that can covered from the

80
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:17,490
local area Fraserburgh

81
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:21,360
and any passwords are found in password

82
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:25,469
Leeds fans in the DNS enumeration about

83
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:29,719
buying anything that's in the case of

84
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:34,889
interest in Mesa sadness when I

85
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:39,240
productions as well then I go under and

86
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:42,810
I'd ever anything that I might possibly

87
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,770
religious in the company and that's what

88
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:49,289
I might do

89
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:51,150
fishing what knows Asian I have a role

90
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:53,699
just stop read this and show you every

91
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,609
company in Scotland because I have yet

92
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,259
to company yet that doesn't have at

93
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,460
least half a dozen password based on

94
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:10,310
South the time you just blue teams

95
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:18,799
and then study password list so enemies

96
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:20,720
I'm innovations will never stand or

97
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,960
static okay and by now

98
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,440
good luck we all have fans over history

99
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,830
on the doors even cover potential softly

100
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:37,820
was cut Valencia on hashes or copy file

101
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:45,370
share with pilots in Pasadena and we

102
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:50,990
cousins named Thomas and very seriously

103
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:54,169
and now start cutting them so first we

104
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:58,190
are centered well imagine terms service

105
00:06:54,169 --> 00:07:02,659
comes please service captain time and to

106
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:06,710
the GSM adjustment and you can choose a

107
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:09,400
password then this chesticles stop

108
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:17,560
sticking around the world to choose

109
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:20,719
prime various rules passenger seat row

110
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:24,259
and then Austin speed running a while

111
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:28,880
was a nasty I have a look at us resonant

112
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:32,020
Silverman fun many common patents so

113
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:38,180
this efficient company and I am a PhD

114
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:42,190
machine image and on our times farming

115
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:50,060
is on and I'm always that television is

116
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:51,949
to fish new teaching silicate night but

117
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,900
that something wasn't work that we do on

118
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:56,870
a client's awesome person into the

119
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,508
mountainside engineers be concentrating

120
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:02,259
learning from Calcutta by Japan's

121
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:02,259
Network and

122
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:12,820
much less puffy cracking so it'd be nice

123
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,820
if I could not even see her

124
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,789
so what can we oughta know oh I've got

125
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,300
some pre-built tissues that I had used

126
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:26,240
every time that doesn't require much

127
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:30,650
with us the cool straight thing you need

128
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,409
to do to get a some kind of specific

129
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:38,689
post for that quite no trans industry

130
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:41,839
but the rest is just a plug if we can

131
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:46,850
automatically look at the track

132
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:50,960
passwords and perfect relatedness those

133
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:53,060
up mr. 15 per block to the equivalents

134
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,650
involved the looking finding Alistair

135
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,359
fish and putting it back in the ditch me

136
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:03,410
then I would save me a lot of often time

137
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:06,500
so I had hazy memories of seeing Google

138
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:11,209
projects years ago which she gives the

139
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:18,320
words and it will find a little group to

140
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:20,390
find out and I could but continue

141
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,860
including an issue dispose of something

142
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:29,510
to Android and items now this is the

143
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:31,790
definitely voting days it means of

144
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,710
building a long dimensional vector

145
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,939
representation through the text we

146
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:38,030
preserve the protectors of my

147
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,130
achievements so was it regularly economy

148
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:44,329
by an attachable to be president United

149
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:47,060
States which basically means computers

150
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:50,110
rubbish at Museum of birds but good

151
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:55,939
enough so we convert

152
00:09:50,110 --> 00:10:00,340
words but that relationships other words

153
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:05,270
then computer can work in pair

154
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:08,540
so very very Italian this is instituting

155
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,949
a slightly embarrassing text and find it

156
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:15,319
comes to the written that the words

157
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:16,760
within that window surround and it

158
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:22,040
doesn't list in fact that I've activated

159
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:26,540
fans to that are huge equal to dance and

160
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:30,800
you end up with effects of every single

161
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:33,020
word in caucus and detective course it

162
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:39,729
takes is big enough and representative

163
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:43,160
or not then those vectors parent

164
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:48,010
relationships to each other so on the

165
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:53,439
fine father was used as some content so

166
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:57,770
ended fish reel had a very single vector

167
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,530
you can find it given HTTP event you can

168
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:06,800
find only factors which are within a

169
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:08,750
certain process and definitely swap rows

170
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,880
with similar vectors which is been

171
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,710
locked on you there's also a couple of

172
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,950
other things as relationships between

173
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:20,330
birds they cannot miss a food derived

175
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:26,120
things like is subtract adapted for

176
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:28,370
obesity competitive tension and that's

177
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,910
the difference to another country of

178
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,190
ended really gets is actually that's

179
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:40,040
very positive ends up in publicity of a

180
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:42,560
mention perhaps as is interesting but

181
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,029
it's not new currency

182
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,878
so any means

183
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:52,410
he finds that factors for similar words

184
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:56,610
news have trusted together so his crappy

185
00:11:52,410 --> 00:12:00,290
she is discontent is not the service

186
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,290
noted was custom cabin cold

00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:09,420
it's fans this is general descent of a

so we need to turn these things on she

192
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:31,660
probably didn't and it takes a lot of

193
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:38,070
time as they've seen communities to

194
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:42,790
clean up the tater and such Edison so

195
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:47,140
what's you don't have to do that you can

196
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:50,969
go wrong in this netting at times

197
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:54,810
downloading but the post on occasion

198
00:12:50,970 --> 00:13:02,200
common core dataset which is is a spider

Susie reviews one of those 1 in 10 G's

201
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:20,980
this is this one seem very interested

202
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:25,860
but I have fun in mass the last 20 years

203
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:30,899
with a significant mass as 10 years so

204
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:33,959
I was very funky to anything so but

205
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:37,830
there's a likely to do in whoo it's

206
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:41,010
called Jemison pipe iconography and it's

207
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:44,790
just a case of it was too late and he

208
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:48,569
brought everything on September 13 so

209
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:53,969
proud of you need to start looking for

210
00:13:48,570 --> 00:14:01,410
some of those so this is a sub usage and

211
00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:04,260
also pivot farming and then set it to

212
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:09,230
consume what were similar to mr. Sherman

213
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:17,450
what you get out is something like that

214
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:17,450
among the top 10 list so 70 simoleons

215
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:31,200
not all thanks to the users password

216
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:34,579
because you don't need a massive amount

217
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:37,500
accuracy is just a huge number of us

218
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:39,390
supplementation so here's another

219
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,970
problem with rampage about put in

220
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:58,110
freezer burn for mountbatten if you had

221
00:14:41,970 --> 00:15:00,779
a very challenging so if I said nagging

222
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:05,300
is now that we see digitally using a

223
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:10,279
spot where this whole scrutiny website

224
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:17,439
and then BOOM I'm tracking on using

225
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:20,840
values upon which we note taking

226
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:25,190
find all the crap muscles discovers 17

227
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:29,720
off quickly very busy pressures to get

228
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:33,170
what particular and then stick out what

229
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,500
this manner stick that word in to Kenzo

230
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:39,310
of those words in to change them and

231
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:44,300
take reverse it was this shucks fabulous

232
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:45,349
put them back English and then repeat

233
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,260
hello

234
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:54,700
so if I were doesn't come back you've

235
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:59,060
any new words or that board is stop it

236
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:03,320
so the advantages of that is I don't

237
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,729
have to change any totally thinking

238
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,840
sometimes especially the middle of a

239
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:11,900
14-1 and it sometimes discovers

240
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,060
relationships don't suppose I'm sitting

241
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,569
on the toilet when I develop into the

242
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:23,479
efficiently the disadvantages are it

243
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:27,710
means a huge dataset to work from it's

244
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:32,930
quite is lost intensive memory and it

245
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:35,480
doesn't run in the hospital or a space

246
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:40,189
it's quite sensitive to the positive

247
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:43,940
input so if you don't clean on the Apple

248
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:46,610
as you discover what necessarily

249
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:49,610
foundation rather workers correctly

250
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:53,690
wages and it doesn't understand context

251
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:56,450
to do so words which have more than one

252
00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:01,960
meaning it might be obvious to you what

253
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:08,140
the person trying to mask what he means

254
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:08,140
but this program doesn't understand

255
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:24,349
so that's essentially what this okay

256
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:26,329
it's not it doesn't send to work quite

257
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:29,320
as well as we doing manually but that

258
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:32,720
means practically no luck identifying

259
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:36,530
things like doctor to use so in future

260
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:41,870
are include the cleaning of the

261

actually runs out and adult pathways I'd

00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,590
like to find some we're receiving it

non Western alphabet I've not tried on

I thank you for that it's very

283
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,620
interesting and have you considered

284
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,980
packaging this up into at all or even

285
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,899
webapp because of things a really really

286
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,429
cool approach of integrating a load of

287
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,140
different libraries and tool sets and

288
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:31,630
it's probably a market out there that

289
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:32,679
would take full advantage of it thank

290
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,870
you for the talk do you have any like

291
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,640
hard numbers on how to still actually

292
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:38,379
perform statistically you said it's like

293
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,150
not quite as good as doing it manually

294
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,790
but have you done any benchmarking or

295
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:50,400
something I'm not entirely sure how to

296
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:55,149
do I have to mention it sir I have a few

297
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:58,630
just looking at resolves some time what

298
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:02,080
I feel this is listing misses things

299
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:04,780
that I might plan well monument and it

300
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,710
does fall relationship stood from the 13

301
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:10,450
images I'm using my limited knowledge is

302
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:15,700
sufficiently mistreated and right okay

303
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:18,160
Middleton's cool but it has the entire

304
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:21,220
repeater to drones and finally it works

305
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:25,270
so it points things that I will report

306
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:29,440
it but I just saw fill all feeling that

307
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:34,270
on the whole I get a better percentage

308
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,600
with password cracks when I'm 14 13 or

309
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,600
so

310
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:45,899
and I'll be able to figure some way that

311
00:21:41,399 --> 00:22:01,590
he tips attention after comparing my

312
00:21:45,899 --> 00:22:04,860
performance of I'm just critical

313
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:07,799
question and do you usually just crack

314
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,899
password dumps or detail actively and

315
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:11,970
brute force passwords

316
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:14,850
I've done accounts which are active and

317
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,830
if you do em how do you add you bypass

318
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:21,909
liked a lot of password lock helpful

319
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:24,958

322
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,899
the talk I thought it's really

323
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:05,149
interesting how long does roughly take

324
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:07,469
you to pull all this together

325
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:09,059
during an engagement like couple hours

326
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,980
to pull this together to be able to sort

327
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:13,649
of crack the word list in terms of

328
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:20,759
effort now that is God's or the library

329
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:22,678
there for you yeah so if you wanted to

330
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,659
do this cracking technique that you just

331
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,279
discussed that how long does it now take

332
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,720
you now there's a library so you'd have

333
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,830
to do it manually roughly there's a

334
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,830
couple hours of effort or

335
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:52,549
see now all jumpin the cool sensitive

336
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:57,490
you once you're starting the season came

337
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:57,490
to listen to the story not another

338
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:11,360
thankee would you agree that probably

339
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:12,860
the most effective way to to use this in

340
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,479
an actual engagement would be to combine

341
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,299
sort of your your natural language

342
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:22,270
processing along with your manual

343
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:22,270
tactics so you would normally used yes

344
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:44,919
there's always on time so listen this

345
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:47,570

346
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:51,919
button usually when we're doing this we

347
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:53,600
do it Cynthia the customer and ideas the

348
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,600
security the passwords across the

349
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,039
organization because once across the

350
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,309
stage were probably chance

351
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:03,940
whoever's favors we were already on what

352
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:09,139
was a very trouble already

353
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:15,860
so incentive means these attraction that

354
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:18,200
is continuous s so this is more giving

355
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,120
in the active data the customer actual

356
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:28,419
situation where pastors they lose focus

357
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:32,469
on achieving the unity person was this

358
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:32,470
difference terrible person

359
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,640
so you've spoken so far about this being

360
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,810
used in the context of an engagement

361
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,820
where you go and help a client

362
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:46,899
organization do you think this tool

363
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:49,270
could be easily made into a form where

364
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:52,230
an organization could self audit their

365
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,230
own password database
