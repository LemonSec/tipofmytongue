1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:08,580
hi everybody good afternoon and welcome

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,669
you're here for a dive dive into

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,669
security risk and what I said before

4
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:17,010
it'll be Paul McKenna I would say that

5
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:20,940
you know I could make you take risk and

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,950
say yes stakeholders on Mars so Who am I

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,900
I it was quite interesting when Connor

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,430
Wilson just before me mentioned that you

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,529
know one of the worst set you know

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,780
devices in your home could be set to

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:35,340
boxes I used to work in electronics and

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:37,140
repair set-top boxes I'm as I sometimes

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,360
say the poorest camp of Scotty cyber

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,300
I've been everywhere don't quite a lot

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,629
of staff in academia work from all major

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,300
banks I inspired the crypto professor to

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:54,480
do crypto I worked with Jamie Graves who

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:56,879
is now running zone folks and some most

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,190
recent things I also helped to ensure

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,550
the security of the core components of

21
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,298
the arc recorder which is if you're

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,090
interested in some distributed stuff so

23
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,470
been there done that I don't have any

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:16,500
t-shirts most of the companies only

25
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:18,690
CableCards Pollack only thought I do

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,530
understand the O'Day chart I do a lot of

27
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,000
technical things I love talking about it

28
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,510
but guess what not everybody likes

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,130
talking about it and often things that

30
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,619
we care about you know as a tech

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,100
security forum I leave it behind

32
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,860
somebody puts them somewhere on

33
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,419
additional bit of the document so so

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,729
what people actually care about is X

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,229
examine that will you left with so if

36
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,950
you want to get something that's where

37
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,210
you need to get it so just to make sure

38
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,830
I'm going to be talking about some

39
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,490
things that have happened in the past

40
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:55,020
and if you recognize the company I'm

41
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,850
talking about it's because you right

42
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:02,329
there so don't share it's all gonna be

43
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:06,780
fine so what is the problem today in

44
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:09,119
security I into few talks today already

45
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,090
I had some messages that was talking

46
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,340
about breaches Facebook doesn't care

47
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,810
those people don't care it just business

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,720
doesn't care that much and

49
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:23,100
how do we make them hair a little bit

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,310
about so imagine you've got the pen test

51
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,739
results are out now you've got the

52
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,800
recommendation you need to get a new

53
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,510
piece of kit into your organization or

54
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,340
somebody is going to take it over you

55
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,290
you know you just get it into your mind

56
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,420
if we found that piece of teeth it could

57
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:43,019
be a flux capacitor by the way you did

58
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,280
not wanna get out alive so what are you

59
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,700
going to do how you gonna get it from

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,790
your stakeholders are you going to do

61
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,649
nothing you know add it to annual budget

62
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,410
unlikely it's usually too small to

63
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,760
actually run the costs for the year you

64
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,910
can wait for a nice project to come

65
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,620
along and ask them or you can still

66
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:07,680
two-tone him from Lydians and sell it on

67
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:10,410
I often use that in the past I basically

68
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,220
waited for a big enough project to come

69
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,019
along whenever they would go into the

70
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,200
transformation cycle eventually they

71
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,959
would have hit one of the security gates

72
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,750
and I would be like you know guys if

73
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,090
you're not doing if you're not going to

74
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,549
do that you can go ahead you can deliver

75
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,590
your project the best I got out of it I

76
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,500
actually managed to get a tactical sim

77
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,380
installed for 1.2 million pounds in one

78
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,329
of the bank's I'm quite glad in that but

79
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,430
it's not things I'm proud of because at

80
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,190
the same time I'm the blocker I'm a

81
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:48,150
security guy saying guys you not gonna

82
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:50,280
go past planning or you know they're

83
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,650
gonna get to the execution if you don't

84
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,290
invest 1.2 million right now towards the

85
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,140
end of your project I'm the bad guy I'm

86
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:03,150
dead you know it feels bad and you can't

87
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:05,339
really oversell so it would be nice if

88
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,290
obviously stake holders will get us near

89
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,480
that when we talk strategy no division

90
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,298
what we want to do with the company but

91
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:19,779
they don't do it often security is the

92
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:21,548
thing that is at the back so and it

93
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:26,340
I get few examples in the past as well

94
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:28,510
so some stories I remember at one stage

95
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:32,159
one of the stakeholders in the bank

96
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:34,900
actually didn't come to us somebody just

97
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,130
send us a little email saying guys that

98
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,260
area in the bank is doing something

99
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,750
risky you know go inspect it and by the

100
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,680
way when I take advantage in any bank I

101
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:47,320
work in most of the vines in Scotland so

102
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,700
when when somebody say that area is

103
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,620
doing something risky we call and speak

104
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,390
to them is like yeah don't worry it's

105
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,070
we're not changing anything so basically

106
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,650
when clients have problems to get online

107
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,270
this phone has happened they want to get

108
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,330
the statement or something or account

109
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,919
balance we just say you know you could

110
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,570
do it all online you can I take you

111
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,880
through the process so they take all the

112
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,620
security details on at all they asked

113
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,719
people what password would you like the

114
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,510
tip it over that form doesn't matter the

115
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,010
Crawleys get recorded and then they say

116
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:20,110
to the customer you can use it now

117
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:21,909
online banking so yeah I had a problem

118
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,080
talking to the stakeholders and telling

119
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:28,180
them guys there's something wrong about

120
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,650
it so it turns out our common sense is

121
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,640
not the common sense that the business

122
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:35,049
stakeholder said how can we fix it if we

123
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,969
don't have a common sense that maybe

124
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,250
there is something else we've got in

125
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:42,940
common so you know business like to talk

126
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:45,190
about money customer satisfaction press

127
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,979
releases and some other flash you know

128
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:51,430
some nice pictures maybe feelings of

129
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:53,860
people say sales pitches security on the

130
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,260
other hand every cut some nice talk we

131
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:00,010
talk about secured by design as clearly

132
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:03,580
injection password complexity great it's

133
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:06,490
nice is I like that chat sky stand get

134
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,990
it you know and then we've got some flat

135
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,970
as well we've got my spy charts of our

136
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,440
dashboards on our new scene actually has

137
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,760
knobbly pie chart if you want to see

138
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:19,479
those holida one thing we actually had

139
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,120
in common is risk you know business guys

140
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,950
talk about risk every day at least

141
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,500
monthly they need to look at the finance

142
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,360
and credit risk and they'll have also

143
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,060
mandatory eristic plenty of ways to

144
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,040
worry about so I learned a popping that

145
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,930
language and

146
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,000
we talked about this but when we talk

147
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,690
about it we want to stop people taking

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
risks when they talk about risk they

149
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,710
want to take risk that's how you make

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,870
money in a business you don't make money

151
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,030
by sitting at home and being wrapping

152
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,380
yourself in a you know in a doobie and

153
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,659
hoping everything gonna be good that's

154
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,820
not how you make money as a business you

155
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:58,180
go out there take a risk to be the first

156
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,190
in the market or something else whatever

157
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:05,950
your domain is and that's how you make

158
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:08,469
money so how do we go about fixing there

159
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,240
is a disconnect about how we talk it we

160
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,220
even talking about the same thing but we

161
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,530
do things in brain perspective a

162
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:22,720
different perspective so where I want to

163
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:25,630
tell you or take you today is how myself

164
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,140
a risk-averse person from a cave diver

165
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:32,650
and relate it to a lot of things we do

166
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:35,890
in security so we can imagine going

167
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,780
diving is actually great sport for me I

168
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,890
can't do meditation I just you know

169
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,190
tried I failed

170
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,770
that's my meditation you know like I can

171
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:47,080
go there with a bunch of friends go

172
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,359
under the water listen to myself

173
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,520
breathing in and out looking to the

174
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,310
world around these visitor there and

175
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,650
relax nobody can call me nobody can talk

176
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,720
to me anyway that is a good app okay

177
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:03,700
down it's fine

178
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,280
it's it's nice and relaxing sport but

179
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,080
there are some risks especially if you

180
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:34,449
can't escape that

181
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:36,968
so actually this is quite a treat ix

182
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,000
visibility dive into it was quite a nice

183
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:42,310
and relaxing experience Amy as well if

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,050
you get Custer public already that's how

185
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:48,880
I used to get there but I now enjoyed so

186
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,290
what is it that we're not when most

187
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,329
people see something like that

188
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,189
careful risk us what security guys now

189
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:55,449
say to the business like careful risk

190
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,149
don't go there

191
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,190
something bad can happen I see a nice

192
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,589
repressed recreational area and that's

193
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,350
that's what's behind that fence there is

194
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:06,310
a huge quarry flooded nobody died before

195
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,490
me and my body

196
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:15,040
that's what if I'd nice quiet nobody's

197
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:16,750
there anyway so how do we get people to

198
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,849
see that at different side and because

199
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,570
I'm now talking to the security proud

200
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,370
I'm taking this view that security maybe

201
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,620
follow rather than the business and I

202
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:31,839
think we can meet in the middle so first

203
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:35,079
of all how risky is it you find out that

204
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,699
if somebody's cave trained it's you know

205
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:41,319
one out of three hundred thousand dives

206
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:44,349
end up being a fatality or causing a

207
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:48,100
fatality normal diving one out of two

208
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:52,440
hundred thousand dives somebody dies if

209
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:55,360
you run a marathon is one out of 100,000

210
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,459
to you guys if you run a marathon I

211
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,329
salute you it's a risky business

212
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:03,719
it is so don't think that K diabetes

213
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:06,099
heart is not insulted you can join us

214
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,660
and obviously driving is far more

215
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,769
dangers and and the like the one that

216
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,180
they like in the bottom right is

217
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:12,519
actually hard something at least wrong

218
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,079
about these sharks people are scared of

219
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,990
sharks but actually you're more likely

220
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,260
to die of flu or stroke or cancer than

221
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:23,380
I'm tiny risk of being bitten by a shark

222
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:25,029
so think about it so if we get

223
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,130
statistics wrong and if we get

224
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:30,370
perception of the risk wrong in our

225
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:32,649
heads is it that we only get it about

226
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,480
other things maybe when we talk about

227
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:37,029
work your man's better among three

228
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,790
security guys and girls we cannot have

229
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:43,180
to be better in each one so in 2019 what

230
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:44,649
was the most likely I'll having malware

231
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,479
and I don't want you to shout to raise

232
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:48,820
your hand or anything let's do it the

233
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:55,839
mentally stylist into yourself one of

234
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:57,850
those answers okay I hope some of you

235
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,310
were surprised because that's the point

236
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,740
of it most people are now talking about

237
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:05,949
office there is it's fair of you know

238
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:10,029
office Kyle palace carrying malware yes

239
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:13,959
there may be a newer wave they are in

240
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:15,550
the news but actually javascript files

241
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:17,170
always carried malware and they still

242
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,529
carry malware and they still majorly t

243
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:23,319
of malware so maybe some other

244
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:26,350
statistics you may have been involved in

245
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,180
one of those ransomware incident how

246
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,980
long will it last you've detected that

247
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,479
also incidents of heart you've got a

248
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:38,110
ransom on your screen how long it

249
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,029
usually takes a company to recover again

250
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,350
think the answer to yourself you know

251
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:45,610
you've got backups you've got everything

252
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:48,040
how long it will take you to recover on

253
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,720
average is seven point three days and

254
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,719
it's usually cost the company about

255
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,550
sixty four sixty five thousand dollars

256
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,680
these are the stats from a company

257
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,810
called cold where an extra body quite

258
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,969
like their statistics and Pat one

259
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:04,089
they've got they say that malware or

260
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,440
ransomware got so bad indeed that now

261
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:09,430
you've got ninety five chance of

262
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,020
recovering your files if you pay them in

263
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,390
the past I would never advise people to

264
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,010
pay I sit on my bicycle to pay but 95

265
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,720
percent chance of recovering your files

266
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:21,000
if you pay

267
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,949
it's pretty good software okay so the

268
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,839
protection of risk is all over the place

269
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:27,029
you know people are scared of terrorist

270
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,000
attack but the risk is actually finding

271
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:32,399
no as the on the bottom is actual reason

272
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,829
pop is how people are worried about it

273
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,579
everybody talks about you know terrorist

274
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:40,949
attacks plane crashes actually you are

275
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:43,680
more of a risk of you know if you're

276
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:46,019
having a glass of wine a day that's more

277
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,839
likely to be a cause of your death

278
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:52,829
rather than the tolerance attack so

279
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,730
here's another one for you have you

280
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:59,670
heard in the last three months that most

281
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:02,009
of the attacks on organizational most of

282
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:05,240
the malware into the organization is

283
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:07,829
carried by the email is coming to me no

284
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,509
thanks that's a start actually all over

285
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:13,529
the place ninety pounds ninety percent

286
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:16,470
of everything is carried by email no

287
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:18,959
this was a Verizon stack the statistics

288
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,809
about AP key had nothing to do with

289
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,250
malware but people that sell ELT tools

290
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:25,350
and other tools are now using it to

291
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,120
advertise and saying come on get our

292
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,579
tools everything is coming through email

293
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,589
it still Remote Desktop Protocol that

294
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:37,529
gets people will be surprised 2018-19 so

295
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:41,970
tune your perception of risk know what's

296
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:43,800
around you and then get back to you know

297
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,689
white cave diving is not so dangerous

298
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,819
you know we still haven't seen the data

299
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:50,370
is it is it dangerous is not dangerous

300
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:52,740
how did it got to that point and command

301
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,959
all had a nice thing is you know

302
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,230
actually you really look at the data and

303
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,559
you shouldn't get any theories about it

304
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:03,540
so in 70s it was a very risky sport many

305
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:06,180
people died actually

306
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,660
no 35 people per year would die cave

307
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,979
diving and then something happened

308
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:15,180
science like that would be put up in

309
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:17,610
Mexico and Florida to warn people about

310
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,819
danger and also put trainings about and

311
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,910
the reason was because somebody Dom

312
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:26,370
accident analysis we found out that most

313
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,719
people that died were actually it could

314
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,080
be family so it could be just

315
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,290
recreational divers

316
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,630
the 70s just q-bag real good quite cheap

317
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,880
so they all create go and dive they

318
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,760
would start diving into a nice little

319
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,240
stream it's open water diving so you can

320
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,279
surface anytime you want and get nice

321
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,959
breath of air and then they would go a

322
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,600
little bit in the caves because they

323
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,550
right next to the streams that was the

324
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,470
right came back on next week and I go a

325
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,569
bit deeper Purple's like it's it's an

326
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,440
easy in cave diving come on it's not

327
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,480
scary at all

328
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,700
it a bit deeper deeper every week and

329
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,880
you know they'll get overconfident

330
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,810
actually I died because of something

331
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,779
they would get to the point where where

332
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:12,130
as our businesses they would you know

333
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,390
you speak to the business and say why

334
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,189
should I do something that you tell me

335
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,810
about I've been operating for the past

336
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,510
three years nothing has happened and

337
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:23,079
it's the same kind of you know reactions

338
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:25,240
so how was it keeps they it was a proper

339
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:26,079
accident analysis done people started to

340
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,750
care about the people

341
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,109
our in a straining state of mind

342
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,850
somebody going diving skills and learn

343
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,040
from the mistakes every time you go into

344
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:40,800
the cave but now you look at the den is

345
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:44,140
like it's pretty much like any framework

346
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,930
for trying to defend yourself this one

347
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,959
is the oldest identified protect detect

348
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,399
respond and recover if you've got a

349
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,529
problem if you want to defend yourself

350
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,600
against something going wrong you can

351
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:57,939
use one of many methodologies but as

352
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,579
long as you go and stick to it to define

353
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:04,029
so when you defend yourself try to work

354
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:08,020
these phases identify what could go

355
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:09,270
wrong for take years of against detect

356
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,279
when something starts to go wrong

357
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:14,970
respond in recover so what how does it

358
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:18,760
translate to things but then do it to

359
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,860
proper level well somebody may die at

360
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,010
the end of it maybe the company is the

361
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:29,170
company gotta die so what kills a crate

362
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:30,670
diver out of those four other confidence

363
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,939
that is most likely to kill them as I

364
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:36,760
said before you know other people that

365
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,829
type you will notice that that's a graph

366
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,779
showing how many people had cave diving

367
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:42,550
qualification hundred and forty three of

368
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,080
them you can have any

369
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,920
having qualifications the people that

370
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,240
actually bothered and done some training

371
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,870
very pretty right not that many open

372
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,190
died but I want you to go further

373
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,870
whenever you're trying to say to

374
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,190
somebody what's gonna happen what is the

375
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,660
wrong thing that are going to happen to

376
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,029
your company or a business or your

377
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,839
colleagues at work or the customers I

378
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:07,660
want you to go further and think know

379
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,150
what's there you know obviously when we

380
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:13,480
talk about loss of visibility that can

381
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:15,579
cause an accident and tango meant yes I

382
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:20,349
can die because of it after maybe half

383
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:22,030
an hour but then panic the game but when

384
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:25,889
I'm diving what's gonna kill me the lack

385
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:28,240
of air or water in my lungs and the same

386
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,790
with the company they not gonna die

387
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,440
because of a data breach and I've seen

388
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,170
you've seen some examples this morning

389
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:38,260
from from other people solving how many

390
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,429
breaches Facebook went through and other

391
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,000
organizations went through and they

392
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:49,480
still alive define so what kills a

393
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:52,690
company so you probably heard about it

394
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,700
in 2007 17 masks

395
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,200
one of the biggest shipment company

396
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:00,820
actually the biggest shipping company in

397
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:03,850
the world was hit by no petia and you

398
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:07,870
know after that incident they had to

399
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:11,110
attach about 4,000 servers 45,000 pcs

400
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:13,809
had to be redone they've been done for

401
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,760
ten days nothing operated so all those

402
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:17,530
ships were out and see waiting to vote

403
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,590
reports because they couldn't unload

404
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:22,000
everything was on phase with the ships

405
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,620
they couldn't unload the cargo because

406
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,690
the system wasn't telling people where

407
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,760
to put the cargo the tracks would

408
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,059
actually queue up outside the ports and

409
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,490
block the major highways everybody was

410
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:33,790
aware of they couldn't do anything about

411
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,770
it

412
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:40,720
so no but so what happened to masks we

413
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:43,090
had some people today saying all the

414
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,070
surprise may drop yes it will drop for a

415
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,520
very short while it not going to drop

416
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,990
for long nurse doesn't day the vertical

417
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:53,290
line there is a day when the actual

418
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:56,080
initiative is no Patea they're in

419
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:58,570
similar time that they had in 2000

420
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,760
seeing they've got now between 2018-19 I

421
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,350
don't see that much offense taking diet

422
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,140
because of it mess will continue to

423
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,418
operate they will be fine but if you

424
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:12,519
would say to mare skies you know you

425
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:14,110
could save yourself 300 million by not

426
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,669
connecting one of your machines to the

427
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,830
network the machine will be using the

428
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:20,830
software from the Train that's gonna get

429
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:24,010
automatically passed by whoever know

430
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,809
somebody you don't trust they'll

431
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,029
probably say yes don't put that machine

432
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:30,190
on a network maybe pay 400 pounds or 200

433
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:32,830
pounds to get it secured so talk about

434
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:35,350
risk can breach analytical that wasn't a

435
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,809
nice one as well they waiting at which

436
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:41,469
they were the bridge we probably heard

437
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:43,720
about them they actually if we look at

438
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,909
breaks it or Donald Trump winning the

439
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,740
election they probably had something to

440
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:49,480
do with it just because they manipulated

441
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:53,320
people's mind in Facebook and other

442
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,779
sources they died they've been outed

443
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,269
last last year Channel Paul ran a

444
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:59,320
documentary about them that company is

445
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:00,929
no longer around

446
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,279
not because of a breach no law but

447
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:04,960
because they ran out of money they run

448
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,600
out of money depending himself from the

449
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,330
press and also their servers were taken

450
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,918
by the IC also they couldn't operate if

451
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,960
they would have more money he would

452
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,250
continue to operate it was another

453
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,019
element there as well

454
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:20,710
companies like Trump which channel it

455
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:23,380
can depend on somebody that he supplier

456
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,019
like Facebook with data we cut them away

457
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,419
from that supplier they're dependent so

458
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:30,760
if you are a bank for example and you

459
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:32,320
have millions of customers and you don't

460
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,690
have one single supplier that can take

461
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,840
you down what happens if you blow the

462
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:40,240
bridge no different a supervisor

463
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:45,639
surprise may drop for five days they

464
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,320
will cost you but not that much there

465
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:49,350
was another case of rock you rock she

466
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,710
was a brilliant one and I hope you

467
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:55,719
actually know about them so if you give

468
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,549
to any password cracking lectures or

469
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,250
anything like that you may have heard

470
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:02,470
about rocky they were the original

471
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:04,690
password log I've got outed on the

472
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,399
internet before 2009 everybody thought

473
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,750
that people were quite clever with their

474
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,120
passwords they actually had proper

475
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,570
random

476
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:16,879
passports but you know one hacker with a

477
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:19,010
clue minimum is is is I he he was able

478
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,870
to execute an SQL injection on their

479
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,780
website and be able to get all the

480
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:26,719
password data from the website and what

481
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,460
was nice he kind of made it public that

482
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,470
you know rocky is not safe so we rock

483
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,540
you said all week now patch our systems

484
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,090
everything inspiring people don't panic

485
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:38,210
but they they weren't honest with people

486
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,370
so you know the attacker can default you

487
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,860
know they need to do something about it

488
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:46,929
so we thought what best you can do he

489
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:49,370
actually took 32 million passwords and

490
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:52,340
add them to the internet with no

491
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:54,500
username so the security industry learn

492
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,689
a lot from it they actually if you know

493
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,580
about people using password one two

494
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,020
three four or something is because of

495
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,389
that breach they were the first one that

496
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:06,800
got beat and what what happened to them

497
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:11,510
that happened 2009 2010 they were still

498
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:13,909
operating they like had to fire about

499
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,500
half of their staff but up until I think

500
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,720
last month they were still operating

501
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,060
taking died that organization did not

502
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,370
die so if you're going and saying to

503
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,500
your stakeholders come on if you don't

504
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,320
patch the system they're going to be

505
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:30,410
huge massive data breach and your top

506
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,990
even as with all your customers that's

507
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:36,080
probably not exactly true you need to be

508
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,150
specific if you are telling your people

509
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,949
that and you need to know what your

510
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,600
company is dependent on so rock in the

511
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,390
game they were depending on Facebook

512
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,129
Facebook could hand down the top and

513
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:48,710
MySpace they could turn down the top any

514
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:51,440
time and that's what happened that's why

515
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:56,720
they actually had to hire a couple named

516
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:59,450
Stan so what gives companies do not pass

517
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,250
their order to close reading bad press

518
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,900
or a breach but it's different for

519
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,920
everybody we need to understand the

520
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,270
business you're helping

521
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,100
don't just tell them it's a bridge

522
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,510
what's gonna kill you this means you

523
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,270
don't understand the business we don't

524
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:13,160
understand the risk it means you don't

525
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:18,770
know how the people you work and will

526
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:21,950
make money okay so identify know your

527
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:24,110
business what does it need to survive

528
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:27,950
and then protect yourself you know in

529
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:30,260
cave diving we we know you can I have to

530
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:32,210
having two bottles of air if if any no I

531
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,519
can easily die because I ran off out of

532
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,179
air I can only keep my breath for 30

533
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,490
seconds

534
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:40,100
I sent inspired myself shot another in

535
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,769
into a deep mind now how do I get out

536
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,570
alive if something happens I need to

537
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:46,340
have a backup so we always carry two

538
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,769
bottles of air into two separate

539
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,750
regulators if we need to separate the

540
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:52,519
bottles we've got the 9-volt at the back

541
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:56,000
which we can just turn down shut down

542
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:58,610
and had two distinct systems if I go to

543
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,049
a type okay I've got another system

544
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:02,209
where I keep the bottles on the side I

545
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:04,700
can take them both off put them in front

546
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:07,460
of me and be okay I'm never going to be

547
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:11,779
seen to go past many obstacles but still

548
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:14,240
a slim as I can get to an obstacle and

549
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:16,130
sometimes the best kit you can get is

550
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,860
not a diving Keith I think that's a

551
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:20,510
lifesaver one of the minds we explore we

552
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,979
need to walk about quarter of a mile so

553
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,899
I think that's the best kit we ever

554
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,909
bought in the or bike or port that gets

555
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:29,330
us to the place and don't get to the

556
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:31,880
place out of breath but what I want you

557
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,230
to think about is you know when you

558
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,600
trying to protect yourself and now you

559
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,500
know what can kill you get the right

560
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,399
tools for the job

561
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:43,580
and surely you know that at least one or

562
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:45,678
two stories of what people buy when they

563
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,960
even money or when they told that

564
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:52,190
something needs to be changed one of

565
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,350
them you know I remember an organization

566
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:57,409
that was told you need to get

567
00:24:54,350 --> 00:25:00,019
correlation between password checkouts

568
00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:02,570
and what is a privilege activity and

569
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:05,149
they went through looking to few

570
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,710
different seen tools and at the end of

571
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:09,500
it they come out with two and that was

572
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:12,950
ages ago was about eight ten years ago

573
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,620
they come out with curators plan problem

574
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:19,370
his plan was it didn't have a security

575
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:21,080
label back in the day and also the sales

576
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,000
guy from the states didn't want to

577
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,039
travel to UK because it's a smash a

578
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,880
small island you know it was a small

579
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,889
market for them

580
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:32,960
curator should not do correlation at all

581
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:35,389
but the salesgirl yeah they were happy

582
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,400
to travel it's free travel come on is a

583
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:41,960
eight hours in they can help you to that

584
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:46,970
organization obviously the time that was

585
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,290
a bank they went for curator and that's

586
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,690
where I brought my first score or

587
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:53,510
checked my first correlation rules in

588
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,130
peril outside of the symptom because the

589
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,799
only way you could do correlation was to

590
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,420
take the logs out of the symbol for the

591
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,950
night

592
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,750
when two different patches compare them

593
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,240
in parallel put it back into the seam

594
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:08,210
tool and see the exceptions the next

595
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:11,000
morning and you think to yourself how

596
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:13,850
much money doesn't waste every day how

597
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,250
much life you're wasting because you got

598
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,159
the wrong tool for a job and your

599
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,890
security if you get something the wrong

600
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,270
be brave enough to say that or think

601
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,730
about the strategy how you're going to

602
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,960
get better so things like that I'm sure

603
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,179
you've got plenty of those horror

604
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,030
stories from your organization's I work

605
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:35,540
with you before and I know few of those

606
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,100
horror stories so get the right tools

607
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,559
for the job

608
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:42,709
and then we took detect that something

609
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:44,809
is getting wrong you know so if you

610
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,730
think about diving accident actually

611
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:48,860
diving at it then often starts at home

612
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,980
all on the journey to your dive site it

613
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:54,559
does not start even down in the cave it

614
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,630
starts with maybe your mindset maybe

615
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,629
something happened on the way maybe it's

616
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:03,260
just not your day one of the cases there

617
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:05,030
was a guy who was on the boat in Scots

618
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:08,030
law one of the beautiful areas up in

619
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:10,070
Scotland and you know he had a little

620
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:12,309
fall on the board obviously we've got

621
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:16,250
like 40 kilos of equipment on our backs

622
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:18,139
so he got up shake himself is like it's

623
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,750
a patient to the skipper and Pines

624
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:24,559
keeper and skipper thought she looks all

625
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:27,470
right let him dive he went died down he

626
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:31,340
was planning a deep dive 260 metres he

627
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:33,320
never surfaced and it was because of

628
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,820
that little ball that he had exactly

629
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,559
happened to his arm he couldn't operate

630
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:41,000
things that he should be able to operate

631
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,799
and actually skipper would go to jail if

632
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,200
not for the fact he did not organize the

633
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,559
trip he was just helping some buddies go

634
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,559
on the boat

635
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,509
so think about rally detect those little

636
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:55,789
signals telling me that something may go

637
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:57,259
wrong and how do you filter them that

638
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:58,658
you also don't waste time and look at

639
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:01,190
too much noise

640
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:02,869
Tesco bank was an interesting case in

641
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,899
2016 I'm sure that we've heard about

642
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:07,519
them they're spent on banks like them as

643
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:10,070
well so they're not my target in here

644
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:13,129
but if you think about them they had a

645
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:18,009
breach they somebody worked out how to

646
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:18,009
do the silly vehicles on their cards and

647
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,049
you know they only lost two points two

648
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:25,850
million pounds in fraud at that bridge

649
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:28,009
so they could compensate all the clients

650
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,990
but obviously that was pretty pretty

651
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,789
uncomfortable situations for the client

652
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,929
to find out they'd be losing money and

653
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:37,789
somebody being deterred in their

654
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:40,850
accounts so actually they've been fined

655
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:44,179
sixteen million pounds for that event

656
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:46,490
and when you read the accident analysis

657
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:48,740
it turns out that the fraud guys knew on

658
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,440
Friday evening that something is going

659
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:53,749
wrong and they keep emailing that little

660
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,580
inbox saying we think something is going

661
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:57,529
wrong you should look into it second

662
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,178
line please look into it and guess what

663
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:00,769
second line was a way for the weekend

664
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:03,470
take in check the email somebody did not

665
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:05,720
check the process and for 21 hours

666
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:09,379
nobody actually started responding to

667
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:12,019
the event just 21 hours before somebody

668
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:15,049
done a change to prevent a fraud from

669
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:17,389
the time they actually detected and I'm

670
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:19,879
sure that they've detected at these few

671
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:22,399
hours you know more after the fraud

672
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:24,860
started happening so get those signals

673
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,619
early teach people to be open and honest

674
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,869
in diving if I could apart feeling that

675
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:31,490
about today you know I make a driven 300

676
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:34,269
miles I'll make it paid if you have the

677
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:37,490
powers to get onto a boat but if I say

678
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:39,110
guys I'm not diving today nobody gonna

679
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:40,610
question and the same in your

680
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,498
organization if somebody sticks their

681
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:46,248
hands up and say guys think something's

682
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:48,230
wrong here go investigate check it and

683
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:51,919
if it's nothing to beat and tell them

684
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:54,019
okay good thank you for telling us this

685
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,190
is not big because of that that and Dad

686
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:57,529
so next time you call something like

687
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:59,299
that think about those things if you

688
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:03,100
think you're still worried come back to

689
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:03,100
us so get those everyone

690
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:11,330
so don't ignore the little things and

691
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,190
then how do you train to respond in

692
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:16,129
dieting on the left-hand side that's how

693
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,990
you learn to scuba dive and do your mass

694
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,559
clearing you're on the bottom of the

695
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,390
pool

696
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,980
got two hands on your mask and you're

697
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,960
trying to blow in the mask to actually

698
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,480
get the F the water out of your mask

699
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,220
when you take diving on the left-hand

700
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,470
side we need to think about things

701
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,020
you've got a helmet you've got a line if

702
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,880
you lose the line and you can see you're

703
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,400
not going to know which way to go where

704
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,620
it's out of the cave so you need to grab

705
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,360
it you need to get the mask out with

706
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,770
your wife and swap it for another one

707
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,699
because your mask is obviously broken

708
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:48,170
and and you turn and you are suspended

709
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,500
in water you can't run on the bottom

710
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:54,170
because the seal just gonna cover things

711
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:59,570
so think about how we train when we do

712
00:30:54,170 --> 00:31:01,880
Tyburn stance all you desktop best

713
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,559
exercises we go and meet people and they

714
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,480
talk how well they're prepared they we

715
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:08,090
told them about that exercise amount

716
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,650
I've had so obviously they don't they

717
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,970
homework but at least they've Secretary

718
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:13,130
done their homework and they've got all

719
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:17,870
the documents ready for the desktop

720
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:20,809
exercise one nice things that I i I've

721
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:22,580
seen before one of the consultants I

722
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:26,300
worked with before his way of checking

723
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:28,010
whether component can pick itself up and

724
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,770
whether the crisis team is up to his

725
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:33,860
scratch he waits for a planned fire

726
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:35,990
drill and after the pilot will teach up

727
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,689
shut up some soldiers of the crisis

728
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:40,850
management even say ok guys andhere's

729
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:43,010
that's you whatever you brought with you

730
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:48,800
we're taking a cue after and you now

731
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:50,870
recopied the company it's much harder to

732
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,210
do it and then that reminds me another

733
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,889
client that when I went there and done

734
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:57,080
an inspection whether they actually

735
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:59,420
prepared for any kind of physical crisis

736
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,550
they say don't worry about it every one

737
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,440
of our employees has a laptop if

738
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,330
something happens they can take those

739
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,070
laptops home we check we've got enough

740
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:10,699
licenses for them to connect remotely

741
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:12,500
they can do everything remotely ok so we

742
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,090
turn up a dog is at 6 a.m. the next

743
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,780
morning

744
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:21,129
what did we find laptops every single

745
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:23,950
desk how are you going to recover from a

746
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:26,020
burning building if your workstations

747
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:28,840
and how people connect remotely to your

748
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:32,980
work are on desks and people don't have

749
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:37,720
them it's not a strategy so train as it

750
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:41,680
is real life have fun talking about it

751
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,960
are you capable of responding 24/7 trust

752
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:48,220
add to one stage last year I learned I'm

753
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,850
not I went to Gaza to do my you know one

754
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:54,160
of my tape training septum few now and

755
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:58,240
on the first day of the course I had my

756
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:00,730
mask pulled off me and that's the first

757
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,880
time I think I felt like I may actually

758
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:05,740
die doing I felt like I'm being

759
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,050
waterboarded so that the thing about

760
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,900
trying to clear your mask especially

761
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:12,610
when somebody pulled off is that yeah

762
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,650
you can had water getting into your nose

763
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:16,810
and stuff like that if you had been on a

764
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,760
flight the previous night you only got

765
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:21,280
to your hotel at 3 a.m. in the morning

766
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,710
and européenne all are all born in

767
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,690
trainings other things didn't have lunch

768
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,660
and then you end up in water and in a

769
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:30,760
risky scenario I actually had to stop

770
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:34,540
that exercise and say guys no that's me

771
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:37,660
today or for this one put my start back

772
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:41,290
on but I was down on the bottom of the

773
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:43,090
cave and just say not no more today and

774
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:45,490
if you think about your responders you

775
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:48,189
know after I read some LinkedIn statuses

776
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:51,550
and is like all guys it's so hard being

777
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:55,870
a security guys we've been here or 5:00

778
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:58,629
a.m. or maybe 6 applaud it's so late and

779
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:01,179
we're still working and that's when

780
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:03,610
you're not being attacked and you

781
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:07,110
telling the word u.s. security board

782
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:12,759
somewhere out there wherever you are and

783
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:13,560
you're not hurt on a normal day do an

784
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,700
easy target

785
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,219
just somebody knocks you off a little

786
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:21,009
bit you don't have any strength to

787
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:23,230
defend yourself a normal shock analyst

788
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,990
can have a analyze something for about 5

789
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:28,270
to 6 hours there were studies done Matt

790
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:30,609
after that they either need to go home

791
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:36,509
get their pizza I've had a walk or

792
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:40,270
something like that so you are not able

793
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:42,370
to be ready 24/7 prepare your team's for

794
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:45,040
it an average person works 40 hours a

795
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:46,380
week Katie our team is organized around

796
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,730
it

797
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:54,040
okay yeah free time supplies timelines

798
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:59,890
lives timelines and statistics we talk

799
00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:03,100
about statistics before so when you

800
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:05,230
trying to recover for magnitude and when

801
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,150
you're trying to do anything try to get

802
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,580
the right benchmarks I've been to so

803
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:11,680
many clients that say all we lose we

804
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:14,980
look at industry data the industry data

805
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,690
is telling us that and we also talk to

806
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,430
other people and they told us that

807
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:20,800
something like that is happening in

808
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:23,259
their environments and then I go to the

809
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,880
man cave so what is happening in your

810
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:29,590
company where is your data where is your

811
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,600
attack data where is the data that tells

812
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,670
me how many times you can breach how

813
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,710
many records you lost how many much

814
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,650
money your company lost at the back of

815
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:40,690
it it doesn't matter that you lost

816
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,960
you know maybe hundred records if you

817
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:45,130
lost hundred records in 2018 I want to

818
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,320
know what was the impact on that

819
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,790
organization I want to know what you've

820
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,060
done with that whether you learn

821
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:56,170
anything but keep it as a data point

822
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:59,529
somewhere and so many people try to look

823
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,700
outside the resolution at least half of

824
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:07,360
the world is inside your own

825
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:10,270
organizations analyzing what you got so

826
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:13,510
to summarize all that these are the

827
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:15,210
points that I covered it would be far

828
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:20,140
too easy that I just left it at that

829
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:21,880
you know it's yeah analyze the problems

830
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,870
you've got think how your company can

831
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:29,020
die and get start from there but that's

832
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:31,690
easy said how do we go about it some

833
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,850
lessons are quite old to be honest on

834
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:37,500
the left one of the best cave diving

835
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:39,400
groups ever Britain was beaten with 70s

836
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:43,990
40 years ago

837
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:46,960
feel as bad as them on the right a book

838
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:50,470
that was written in or release in 1936

839
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:53,369
and if you're a consultant I advise you

840
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:55,930
read I've been told about this book

841
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:57,490
eleven years ago I had not read it I

842
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,259
thought oh it's about cheating people no

843
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,598
it's not about cheating people it's

844
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:04,240
about how to be nice and understand

845
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,789
other people's perspectives and get to

846
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,589
understand them and help them so if you

847
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:10,270
try to help somebody with a security

848
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:12,640
guide consulting speaking to people I

849
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,710
will read it for the right reason just

850
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,460
because you want to understand other

851
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:23,680
people and the way they see the world so

852
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:26,710
and also we don't defensive side we are

853
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,569
not attacking anybody we not a business

854
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,190
trying to do something the reason that

855
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:32,650
myth that you need a strong leader

856
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:35,020
everywhere you need strong leader to

857
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:38,349
take you to the moon let's say you need

858
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:41,200
strong leader to be on the offensive

859
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:44,529
side to attack some money only defensive

860
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,439
side as I said before one person can

861
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:49,119
only cover you for 40 hours a week we

862
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,309
want a strong team of people helping

863
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,589
each other talking to each other if

864
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:55,390
you've got risks function near company

865
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:58,599
that audit function your company and

866
00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:00,160
your security person don't go to the

867
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:03,609
business without speaking with those

868
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,690
guys if you go to the business and say

869
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:07,150
we need to do that

870
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:09,099
the risk person sells non-oil you surely

871
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:11,920
can't do that and the audit has a third

872
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:13,690
perspective and you expect the business

873
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,240
to be the responsible adult even that

874
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:18,490
they don't have a clue about security

875
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:21,160
you're doing it wrong go and speak to

876
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:23,348
everybody you can and go and build a

877
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,960
herd you know the team of people that

878
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:28,529
like to have fun but actually like to do

879
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,529
something interesting

880
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,079
[Music]

881
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,770
we need to get better and better

882
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:53,160
so in here it's me with a blindfold

883
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:55,380
trying to get myself out of a cave I

884
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,730
didn't know I get lost I need to find

885
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,849
the positions I aim

886
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:01,770
I can't just try to navigate it and wing

887
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:04,109
it because I'm a believer in a cave so I

888
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:06,119
need to ignore position I mean so you

889
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:11,640
practice harder and harder every time

890
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:13,920
you do something and you know at this

891
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:17,670
time I was going to tell you about the

892
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,930
final exercise I've been doing these two

893
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:21,030
people are applying for they're trying

894
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:23,160
to get out of the cave because we

895
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:26,339
simulate zero is that maybe there I'm

896
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,560
now running out of air I mean the head

897
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:31,020
means I don't have any more air we need

898
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,200
to find to get air from that guy and get

899
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:36,570
out I was going to say that if you

900
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,790
practice I'd let the crowd of people

901
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:42,329
like minded and that's why we have fun

902
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:45,839
with them insecurity in other things

903
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:49,049
you can do amazing stuff life actually

904
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:51,179
is better than that me planning it do

905
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:53,459
you remember the typo is getting stuck

906
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:55,699
in a cave last year there's 12 typos in

907
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:59,098
the code called stuck in the head and

908
00:39:55,699 --> 00:40:01,650
one one guy that came to the rescue was

909
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:06,709
false those drawers Bradley

910
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:09,719
and that guy last week last Tuesday

911
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:12,629
never returned from the I was with the

912
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:16,099
bodies exploring some new caves they

913
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:18,689
came out he wasn't there we called 9-1-1

914
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:19,799
the cave rescue team came bound his

915
00:40:18,689 --> 00:40:21,269
bodies couldn't get him they were

916
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:23,038
exhausted they didn't have air they were

917
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:25,258
and sitting up to go back in the cold

918
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:30,509
night one man and waited for them to

919
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:32,699
arrive 24 hours later those guys you

920
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:36,029
know are extracting the papers cooking

921
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:38,339
saying you know we know Josh if he got

922
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:41,670
into troubles he would try to get to the

923
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:43,799
safest place is in thyroid 24 hours in a

924
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,920
cave there is a place where he could

925
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:47,969
potentially have survived for 24 hours

926
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,579
but it's through some narrow and

927
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:52,469
dangerous passage and you know the

928
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:55,049
rescuers went into the cave at six eight

929
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:58,319
six o'clock in the afternoon 50 minutes

930
00:40:55,049 --> 00:41:01,170
later that guy came out himself they

931
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,549
just kept in there he came out and just

932
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,589
asked for pizza and thank everybody

933
00:41:02,549 --> 00:41:07,529
involved next day he was back in the

934
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:10,170
cave and it's because he practiced these

935
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:11,880
10,000 hours and harder than hard and

936
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,489
hard and environments he wasn't easy on

937
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,799
himself and he was having fun while he

938
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:18,209
was doing it it's not about being tough

939
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:21,479
on yourself if you're not having fun

940
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:23,098
what you're doing change jobs I really

941
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,499
advise it find the place where you enjoy

942
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:29,459
what you're doing

943
00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:31,738
so get out to some ground things daily

944
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:34,078
you will that came strong but you can

945
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:38,429
help you recover from them that things

946
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,959
that are interesting and build ahead and

947
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,699
remember it's not about a leader when

948
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:44,249
you depend about building a strong team

949
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:46,309
that biggest top of the leader is to

950
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:49,948
find the right people for the team

951
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:51,989
so thanks very much now started an

952
00:41:49,949 --> 00:41:54,089
initiative called cyber escapes together

953
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:55,120
I haven't started I'm not helping some

954
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:58,000
guys doing

955
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,560
that they started it I think is a great

956
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,250
initiative we couldn't go with that

957
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,770
forward

958
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:04,990
it's called cyber escapes we will get

959
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,930
like-minded people together to have some

960
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:10,330
fun explosive to it'll melt people sides

961
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:13,060
not just pen test not just crypto but

962
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:15,549
also some analyzing of data and actually

963
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,509
speaking to people as well you want to

964
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,640
