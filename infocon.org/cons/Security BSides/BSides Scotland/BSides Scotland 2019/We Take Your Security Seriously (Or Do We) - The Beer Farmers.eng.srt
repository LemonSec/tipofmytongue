00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,789
which eternity is shot in that dead

29
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:29,670

35
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:48,899
that's how you get was on Twitter and so

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,249
we did a bit research in the studio last

37
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,619
week but we've actually definitively

38
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:54,779
proven that we're all Scottish so we'll

39
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,049
explain I was born in Eddie Redmayne but

40
00:01:54,779 --> 00:02:01,408
this Scottish Italian Scottish

41
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,770
Glaswegian that's still Scottish though

42
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:07,530
yeah no yeah

43
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:09,090
sure tell us a story yes my

44
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,720
great-grandfather went to school with

45
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:14,910
Sir James Barry you're right Peter Pan

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:20,730
so and that's where my family name comes

47
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:23,609
from yeah the only thing I have is that

48
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,369
at one time the name the family name was

49
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,410
little and there is a Scottish clan

50
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,750
called the littles who didn't get

51
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:34,410
invited to many battles for clearly

52
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,959
obvious reason well six gosh we think

53
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,079
because they're hidden

54
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,940
yeah Canadians guys and John has got so

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,890
did your hair is bed yeah

56
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,890
switcheroo can that qualifies

57
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,320
unfortunately okay so we included

58
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,059
facebooking are talks quite a lot

59
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,980
because they're egregious and they tend

60
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,530
to do bad things with your personal day

61
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,609
on a weekly if not daily basis so I am

62
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,850
elective qualifies from the things I say

63
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,440
about Mark Zuckerberg so I do a bit and

64
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,840
that was a mistake he came up with quite

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,120
a few other privacy is the norm social

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,720
normal past I think from his point of

67
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,450
view that's absolutely accurate and

68
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,090
there's a clear perception that Facebook

69
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,768
is an evil organization people are very

70
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,910
little a zero trust of that organization

71
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,700
to do the right things with your data

72
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,230
and that they need regulation and I

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,579
fully agree with this as soon as Mark

74
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,440
Zuckerberg people actually came out the

75
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,769
other day instead that particularly the

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,870
US and Facebook government should do

77
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,150
more to help regulate social media and

78
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,370
large tech groups generally accepted

79
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,660
some unhappy paying the fine it slows

80
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,940
the the ICO for the example if you've

81
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,549
reached actually appeal and not fine so

82
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,560
yeah mistrust of government is but just

83
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,600
to clarify that so I converse said he

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,780
was supported the government but not the

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,209
part yeah yeah coincident you scratch my

86
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,230
back so I want to point out something as

87
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:06,570
a keen study of human beings their face

88
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,940
that you see there of mr. Zuckerberg is

89
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,840
not one filled with contrition he's a

90
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,280
super yeah I think that what this is is

91
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,370
the face of an individual that is

92
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,100
now become being called to task for what

93
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,590
the cavalier attitude towards privacy

94
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:27,850
had the business model that he's made

95
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:29,409
monetizing private yeah stuff so he's

96
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,910
not sickened the weight businesses

97
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:38,650
behave is actually sick of being caught

98
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:41,320
just a really Shipman yeah who is

99
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,620
deleted facebooking a shot man to delete

100
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:48,219
facebook as a consequence to see quite a

101
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,350
few people yeah great

102
00:04:48,220 --> 00:05:04,390
who's happy to continue using Facebook

103
00:04:50,350 --> 00:05:07,330
despite the fact that they are continue

104
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:10,810
to use so quick look at some of the

105
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,370
numbers and 50 million in 2014 was can

106
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,970
be generally together so we all know

107
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,500
about that

108
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,900
that's a part the why these were

109
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,460
inspired not just the FBI because the

110
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,440
ICO raided Claire be gentle acres

111
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:25,210
offices a week after all the day there

112
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:28,090
was some player in a field but yet 15

113
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,820
million accounts were manipulated and

114
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,979
sent off to be used to target election

115
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,010
campaigns and political activity and

116
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:38,320
just on that there was a about a

117
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,599
five-minute TED talk that I posted and

118
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,300
see seed in the beer farmers he could

119
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,220
find it in our in our timeline I found

120
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,810
it very interesting that before this all

121
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,460
went down Facebook attempted to sue the

122
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,260
journalists that were going to break the

123
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,299
story of Cambridge about a little in

124
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:59,560
order to keep the salt quiet so again

125
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:02,970
not exactly what I call contrition and

126
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,910
more recently last year 29 million

127
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,530
accounts were compromised due to

128
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,970
authorization tokens being leaked and

129
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,890
that was to do with the way the apps

130
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,450
that allow you to sign into using your

131
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,969
Facebook credentials were working

132
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,219
properly there was a bit of a officer

133
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,919
positive you know off made around the

134
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,720
way and this and that cause 29 million

135
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:25,510
records to be to be leaked

136
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,880
under the nearly 7 million and then more

137
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,530
recently 1.5 million records were

138
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,759
and also in the news you may have heard

139
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,500
that Facebook actually requested that

140
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,180
your primary email countless who have

141
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,860
been provided as part of alternate

142
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:44,090
authentication into that platform

143
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:46,610
why okay no idea they admitted it bad

144
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,520
practice so it's a bad practice

145
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,199
continues and I think they messed up

146
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,539
with that email because they sent the

147
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,539
emails to someone or something yeah but

148
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,229
[Music]

149
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,948
again and going back to the narrative

150
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:06,020
here

151
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:09,590
they didn't accept responsibility for it

152
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,780
they said it was a actual mistake

153
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,000
even though many in the security

154
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,909
community pointed out that it's not

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,949
really a mistake somebody somewhere set

156
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,080
up a juror a ticket and developers

157
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:27,380
actually worked on that's not really a

158
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:30,070
mistake okay so who do you can shower

159
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,070
with this guy

160
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,120
all right you have not put it to one

161
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,280
side you can come get it I'm not a

162
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,470
different things anymore yeah it was a

163
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:49,520
business leads yeah different honey it

164
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:52,760
was tonight it was jealousy easy the

165
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,020
founder of Twitter and he's gone from a

166
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,330
look better hit me Karen

167
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,530
with thing so his original idea here was

168
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,400
I just want to build stuff that really

169
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,869
simplifies our peer interaction and

170
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,310
previously could get lost to piss off

171
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,669
that's what these people think this is

172
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:10,159
how they operate so 340 million Twitter

173
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:12,680
accounts were lost in 2018 if anybody

174
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:13,940
was aware of that but again it was to do

175
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,710
with a have been compromised because

176
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,080
they were taking your security seriously

177
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:22,159
if these guys these guys can't get it

178
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:25,039
right but and actually something to add

179
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:27,590
to this is just as the newly report came

180
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,349
out they saw a three hundred and sixty

181
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:33,228
two percent increase in bought activity

182
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:34,789
associated with you know the the release

183
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,940
of the Mueller report and starting

184
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,689
rumors and trying to construct some

185
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,870
information there

186
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,209
yeah complete misinformation campaign

187
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,649
but it's very easy to create software

188
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,508
played column what you like and then

189
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:48,769
make a causal - it says we see quite

190
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:50,810
regularly

191
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:52,339
it doesn't places so I've seen probably

192
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,489
this last week about twenty to thirty

193
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:57,589
bar counts try to mount a day yeah

194
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,980
because everyone wants I never been this

195
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:03,170
popular so I think the Paradise Lost

196
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,910
counted back for is around the idea they

197
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,319
start with the great intentions about

198
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,529
how they're gonna change people's lives

199
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:11,899
for the better and almost invariably it

200
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,730
goes to because they get bigger and

201
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:16,069
then money becomes the primary motivator

202
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,839
money money is known

203
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:20,290
we're money into this opposed to them

204
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,290
yes

205
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:27,199
oh yeah if the products free you in the

206
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:31,759
front this is the see like your data

207
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:34,939
delete money on them so this lies

208
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:37,990
benebabe and since last couple of talks

209
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:40,969
at Windham we have it around 21 billion

210
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:43,130
records kicking out the kickin around

211
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,259
their leaves that was considered to

212
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,939
three records per human on the planet I

213
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:48,050
supposed to try not about that just to

214
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:52,370
get his day because he's kind of

215
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:54,290
authority update reaches it's nearly ten

216
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,899
records perhaps every single human

217
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,779
moving the moon walking on the planet 77

218
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:01,610
billion and now I still think that set

219
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,420
style playing another but see we listen

220
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,029
Tommy Norment

221
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,339
yeah woman reaches a good way to test

222
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:08,899
missus gets if you're in a company gets

223
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,459
so much for them they email and how

224
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,930
about be informed what their one is

225
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:13,930
going to you to pop up with someone else

226
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:21,138
so who's heard of 63 reg your hands it's

227
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,620
gonna be a good story then not too many

228
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:28,779
up and they are sort of right-wing

229
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,779
American organisation saw a rate

230
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:35,060
they are a right-wing conservative us

231
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,149
motorcyle again I said it trying to make

232
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,369
America great again what we do is we're

233
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:42,440
making the blue hoodie Greg that's right

234
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,050
that's this black we use ours yeah the

235
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,390
slimming is they are their troop

236
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,770
sympathizing organization and they don't

237
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,110
take too kindly or anybody that

238
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:54,470
criticized securely on Twitter that's

239
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:56,480
who they are and anyone who heard them

240
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,420
earlier obviously not be mr. robot of

241
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,459
the show of the security researcher yeah

242
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,270
also known as party scrubber Nazis real

243
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:06,770
man that's design uses exercises to our

244
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:09,470
really good guy really capable really

245
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:11,270
very active in trying out things around

246
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:15,589
with organizations and trying to work

247
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:18,829
there and a little bit of weight loss 63

248
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:20,899
we found the vulnerability 63 went went

249
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,390
a big now head start calling him

250
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:25,870
names and things threatened to report it

251
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,880
to the FBI are claiming the good morning

252
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:32,420
was completely futile exercise even if

253
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,920
it were true if you know good people of

254
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,229
course the content yeah but the guy that

255
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,969
put the garlic tomato crime okay just to

256
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,959
be clear when he did took the Apple

257
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:45,470
AppStore publicly available to assemble

258
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:49,010
that again no legal things around there

259
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:51,230
as far than I and then just view the

260
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,510
trigger baby comes out yet all the

261
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,750
servers so you wasn't doing anything

262
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,980
because they messed up but they will

263
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,920
talk about a little bit more detail a

264
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,870
few minutes had about dipped and but

265
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,270
they the community cannon which got

266
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:10,220
stuck in and I was included in some self

267
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,110
immunity all the lambie's colleagues it

268
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,240
was suddenly morning that we decided it

269
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,570
would know any better plan take this guy

270
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,130
down

271
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:22,130
so that's what we went about doing so

272
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,720
Andy and I piled on a few other people

273
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,610
got involved and then we did some

274
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,200
research because the guide had it was

275
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,630
passing quite bad upsetting other

276
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,360
websites that Iran they had a number of

277
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,489
read

278
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,649
he claimed containers original iPad

279
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:36,779
copyright material which we found to be

280
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:37,889
old or empty and then eventually we

281
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:40,860
found out that it was a white

282
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:42,540
supremacist okay because we traced back

283
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,279
to the started between that where it was

284
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,959
basically saying that there are enough

285
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,739
opportunities for white edge America

286
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:51,959
because of anybody white not and so not

287
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:55,049
that outage we prevailed I think there's

288
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:58,878
a group of people and now it's back that

289
00:12:55,049 --> 00:13:01,980
was the end of their job done oh my god

290
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:10,170
his name was full I don't know bounced

291
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:13,049
it forward yeah yeah you reimbursed

292
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,089
you took it yes he reared his ugly head

293
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:16,769
and decided to be divisive in the

294
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:23,399
community and I stomped on that pretty

295
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:25,980
hard nope hey yeah don't baby I love

296
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,629
this so what we've done anis has

297
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,059
actually been a teaching tool for a lot

298
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:32,999
of businesses because what we've come up

299
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:35,730
with is a hurricane like scale for the

300
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:37,999
level of ships form that a company can

301
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,989
get into any when they mystery

302
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:43,110
researchers we've seen this play out

303
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:46,619
over and over again it happens all the

304
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,389
time and with the best intentions of in

305
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:50,489
most cases I'm gonna say the security

306
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:52,679
researchers are generally trying to

307
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:55,860
identify a problem a customer facing

308
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:58,949
problem a security problem and they get

309
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,049
treated pretty horribly when that

310
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:04,109
happens the community is sort of a

311
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:07,230
little bit I would say defensive and

312
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,720
there's a overreaction and I think what

313
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:13,379
really came out of this scale was we see

314
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,509
the pattern going over and over again we

315
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:17,189
know some basic rules like having John

316
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:19,169
McAfee talk about your product is

317
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,149
probably not the best idea ever

318
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:23,549
how could that happen talk first often

319
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:25,470
on yeah yeah on his boat in an

320
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:26,809
undisclosed location pay for you later

321
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,999
on yes

322
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:31,559
but this has been now a good teaching

323
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:33,839
instrument when we start to see

324
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,850
something go sideways we'll post it into

325
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,709
the thread stream

326
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,630
kind of folks can understand exactly

327
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:42,388
what's gonna happen and then we see the

328
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,430
meme count going up we know that from a

329
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:47,100
cyber depression a full-on

330
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:51,089
cyber tropical storm is about to

331
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:53,339
impact the company we've seen I think a

332
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:56,360
lot of success in educating companies

333
00:14:53,339 --> 00:15:00,149
about how to approach and deal with

334
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,459
security researchers and I think I'm

335
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,199
hopeful because the last couple ones

336
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,529
that we've seen as much to nip it in the

337
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:08,939
bud and just kind of say hey you know

338
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:11,100
you're not out to get you they're not

339
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,930
out to like hurt you they're actually

340
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:18,060
out there to fix things for for the

341
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:20,849
company and it can either sacrifice just

342
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,920
to further strength from that simply try

343
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,329
to call them out for my legal threats

344
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,579
doesn't make this you go away

345
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:28,739
if she's still there and it just makes

346
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:30,000
you look that yeah and also like

347
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,259
physically assaulting a security

348
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,259
researcher at a conference that happened

349
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:38,850
no no it's it's not I think what

350
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:40,550
highlights it occurred to me you sold

351
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,560
stolen so that's the question about

352
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,149
researchers being afraid to be Jasman

353
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,540
could be the first place for therapy

354
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:50,339
thank you Rick yeah I think there's a

355
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,660
kind of schism between the researcher

356
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,029
that wants to do the right thing and how

357
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,269
the company should be responding as well

358
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:58,410
so I think in a lot of the help Givens

359
00:15:56,269 --> 00:16:00,029
scenarios that we see it woke up early

360
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,469
just flustered they don't know how to do

361
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,000
about it so the media reaction is a

362
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,649
negative reaction because you're

363
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,689
accusing the axillary so I'm going to

364
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:09,449
backlash against that so I think the

365
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:11,370
better education around how to respond I

366
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:12,990
don't mean which model this version per

367
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,550
se I mean how does a couple gear itself

368
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,459
work to get back to that surgery in a

369
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,380
responsible way well then there's how

370
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,359
many of you have heard responsible

371
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,699
disclosure

372
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,009
okay quite a few so responsible

373
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:29,189
disclosure phobos you don't know is when

374
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:31,920
a researcher works with the company to

375
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:33,990
go through the issue and not release

376
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,519
anything information about the issue and

377
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,199
told that issues been fixed right we'll

378
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,050
give them a suitable time period to do

379
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,599
that everything is emphasis on the

380
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,880
researcher with emphasis on the

381
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,889
companies for their part of it so I

382
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,660
wrote a while ago responsible disclose

383
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:49,820
their response

384
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,050
ball countability companies need to be

385
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,760
equally accountable

386
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,790
why is everything on the researcher

387
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,620
shouldn't be that way if it was a bear

388
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,110
man the researchers doing this of their

389
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,290
many of them or throwing back there are

390
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:05,270
new sources there in time an equipment

391
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:07,849
social company they don't have much to

392
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,960
petty or anything at all so it just

393
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,240
doesn't make sense

394
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:15,680
one thing that was really frustrating

395
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,210
Chrissie store at the any set big was

396
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,790
they trying to develop international

397
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:22,160
standards around disclosure to protect

398
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,750
the researcher and I'm fascinated by

399
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,410
them I think not soon enough

400
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:30,800
it has to be I think I think one of the

401
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:33,050
other factors too is as a security kind

402
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,220
of community analyst for lack of a

403
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:38,750
better word the impatience that our

404
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,630
profession instills on us like that

405
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,850
sense of urgency that doesn't translate

406
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,260
well to large enterprise organizations

407
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,050
with a software development lifecycle

408
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,120
and a project management cycle that is

409
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,379
like months small yeah right my Alison

410
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,149
doesn't timely well known with the rest

411
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,130
of the business so like what these an

412
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,410
entity might think is a critical risk

413
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,270
ideally realistically of is an internal

414
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,440
system it's not very interesting it's

415
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,330
going to be wasn't impact the business

416
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,510
and what looking at where the money is

417
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:07,760
their economy DeMarre custom 20 my

418
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,770
name's effects its verses 10 minutes

419
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:16,220
they get reached up a little comforting

420
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:19,010
to not pay for this yeah okay

421
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,500
so tropical I'm gonna go quickly through

422
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,690
this because this is a really

423
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,520
interesting scenario and bleeds into

424
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,860
that area that I love to explore which

425
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,550
is the politics behind a lot of cyber

426
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,709
breaches

427
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,080
so if you're familiar with why Pro

428
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,730
they're similar to the data

429
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,240
communications they're an outsourced

430
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:40,910
player eight billion in annual revenue

431
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,930
Brian Krebs broke an amazing story about

432
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:47,390
how they basically it was leaked that

433
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,660
they were breached at a very sensitive

434
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,340
time in the company just before earnings

435
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:55,880
way there was a small paragraph that I

436
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:58,850
dug into around this because it seemed

437
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,920
that prior to this leak occurring about

438
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,560
how this company

439
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,380
compromised allegedly by apt tan cloud

440
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,720
hopper operatives who target managed

441
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,690
service providers and IT people so that

442
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,450
the TTP's look like it's cloud hopper

443
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,860
for now anyways what was really

444
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:18,100
interesting about this is that the

445
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,379
Chinese and Pakistan have been working

446
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,699
on a project in a Kashmir and the

447
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,350
default position of the Indian

448
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,750
government is that anything that's good

449
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:31,300
for Pakistan is bad by default for India

450
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:34,420
prior to this hack the Indian government

451
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:38,110
forced 166 million u.s. dollars in

452
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:41,590
shares and repatriated them to Indian

453
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:44,409
companies allegedly that the shares were

454
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:47,679
illegally held by Pakistan investors and

455
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:50,560
Chinese investors so there is kind of

456
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,350
this theory that I'm working with that

457
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,590
suggests that this company was basically

458
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:59,439
used to instill more patriotic fervor in

459
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,040
the Indian government by repatriating

460
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,070
these shares

461
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,440
well interestingly enough they data leak

462
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:08,889
happened on and just prior to an

463
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,990
earnings call and you guys are smart

464
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,880
people so you know that if a company's

465
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,640
boo breached what does their share price

466
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,240
do as soon as that announcement it head

467
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,850
south right exactly so if you know and

468
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,250
you have friends that are holding shares

469
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:27,010
in that company and you know there's

470
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,570
been a data breach what do you do well

471
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,970
in America you go to jail for something

472
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:33,669
called insider trading I'm not sure if

473
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,050
that law actually applies in India but

474
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,640
you let your friends know that you're

475
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,669
gonna leak the fact that this company

476
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,370
got data breach so you can take that 166

477
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:44,410
million and what's called short the

478
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,800
stock in order to make even more money

479
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:49,570
okay so this is my hypothesis and the

480
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,659
most interesting thing about this is

481
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:55,720
what we're seeing is the monetization of

482
00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:00,040
the information about the company's

483
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:02,140
posture during a data breach event so it

484
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:08,649
really worth exploring and understanding

485
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:13,270
why stuff is occurring okay anybody

486
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:17,350
familiar with collection one the rest

487
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,610
and Leona yeah yeah so I the collection

488
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,689
done for those of you who don't know is

489
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,330
probably one of the biggest public

490
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,310
breaches a breach dumpsters been

491
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,330
essentially rode the boat the start of

492
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:29,440
the year in the last year there was

493
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:32,590
about 1.5 1 terabyte of personal details

494
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,690
leaked on the Internet this was user

495
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,810
details user credentials passwords

496
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,760
Bitcoin addresses lots of stuff and it's

497
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:42,040
made available but that's what snow

498
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,290
contributed to figure out the beaches

499
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,670
and the I think absolutely written

500
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,340
recently through up Troy hunts gone

501
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:51,820
through and with a fine-tooth comb

502
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:53,320
unique references about 70 million which

503
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,879
is I mean it's a few it's not quite a

504
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,879
billion cover you'll get civilian at one

505
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,680
point but it's getting its put the kind

506
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,960
of national sea national the global

507
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:06,820
average or breaches up by a factor of

508
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,990
million yes and it's it's great for me

509
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,689
as a pen tester because it gives me

510
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:13,630
massive lesser passwords to crack but as

511
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,070
an individual you're guaranteed at least

512
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,230
one of your accountability on that

513
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,000
you're always doing people you probably

514
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,760
have multiple email addresses here I'm a

515
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,530
fuel person than a native from back in

516
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,950
the 90s might get breached that you're

517
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:29,290
I'm not so cool mm may not be so I think

518
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,760
the there was a lot of conjecture at the

519
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,680
time about well should we really care

520
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,110
it's not you day away you should get

521
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,630
annex all day and it's now probably and

522
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:39,310
if you're using any of this these

523
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,870
potential another big the big problem

524
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,110
the biggest problem is hassle reduce it

525
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,760
even even if you've changed your account

526
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,020
most of your security over said I assume

527
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,350
your change of password every few months

528
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,450
right some of you might up if you reason

529
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,550
your passwords don't change them

530
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,110
and but yeah they'll probably be in this

531
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,430
list the thing is as well because it's

532
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,080
such a big list just because you change

533
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,520
your password your new password maybe in

534
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,990
the West so don't use that you know most

535
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,180
people use past previous big of all

536
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,880
passwords password or a pass for miles

537
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:11,040
as well it was that held in fair yeah

538
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,870
boy family is when you can all right

539
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,500
that's that's that okay

540
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:22,120
and yeah I mean the problem is huge and

541
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:23,580
anybody recognize this your hands that's

542
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,750
a no you still awake

543
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,820
it's information is beautiful its

544
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,490
website go and look at it it's a really

545
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,139
powerful way of showing your business or

546
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,779
I'm going to get trying to get your head

547
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,580
around the the scope of this problem and

548
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:38,260
I haven't see that you'll find yourself

549
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,320
in there you will have an account in

550
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,908
that multiple accounts unless you'd

551
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:49,928
never be with them unless you know me on

552
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:51,429
the internet which so what they're this

553
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,080
is what we see it does this goes back to

554
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:56,830
our our previous point around how how

555
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,860
businesses react it makes a few good

556
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:02,678
points what we'd like to see versus what

557
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,289
we witness viewed eminently what what

558
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:06,610
does it effectively repeat soon you know

559
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:08,110
and this brings up a really point you

560
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,639
know how we talked about like users

561
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,070
security awareness training your user

562
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,100
security training we need like companies

563
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,720
security training but the opposite right

564
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,370
you know Todd made some really great

565
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,110
points about you're gonna get breached

566
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,789
you should have a plan let's slice its

567
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,699
this part of your plan is how to

568
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:27,010
communicate did you know that that we

569
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,470
have a situation we're working through

570
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,860
it yeah you know we talk about this all

571
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,360
the time but there doesn't seem to be

572
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,580
educational resources available for

573
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,139
companies you know to the point where

574
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,059
you know we're focused on the user who

575
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,770
don't click on links or I click on links

576
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:48,399
for a living all day long that's what I

577
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:51,399
did okay Hajj Allah he surfaces from

578
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:54,189
time to time publicly attention of some

579
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:56,739
toys continuously attention jobs

580
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:59,230
colleagues back spent but this is the

581
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,120
the hash tag unhackable the idea that

582
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,010
you can create a product and then sell

583
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,199
it on the premise that is completely

584
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:08,559
invincible in service to attack we see

585
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,210
everything to preserve you and a hundred

586
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,940
percent of the time it's proven to be

587
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:15,220
wrong what we find is that it's a

588
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:19,960
popular topic of research and test

589
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:22,780
partners doesn't mean a free pen thirst

590
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,310
they didn't still be

591
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,040
but generally you all get a free pen

592
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:30,220
tastic you do splits it on Twitter yeah

593
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,600
if you think about it yeah because yeah

594
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,860
because it was even pointed out you know

595
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,330
well pretty smart people write

596
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,919
everything that we know is these things

597
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,659
really quickly and when somebody goes

598
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,270
online near a public forum and says yeah

599
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:42,220
hi guys we've got your lock think that's

600
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,050
gonna secure all your things any so by

601
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,150
the way some hacker book we've got the

602
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:48,730
best kind of secure all you've got yeah

603
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:51,250
the best you can expect a week a week

604
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,350
yet a past before it's been completely

605
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,170
absent the world know that action well

606
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,669
that so Pandora get pulled inside of ten

607
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:59,110
minutes and you get the guy who had

608
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:02,350
watched repentance partners who we call

609
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:04,270
the EPA Jesus he literally looked at see

610
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,399
the eyes all day long and he he found

611
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,020
either in said attainment and secured

612
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,370
direct object reference which would

613
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,530
allow you to a through it through

614
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:14,560
people's details and access their cars

615
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,889
unlocked them drive away yep fast and

616
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,050
easy

617
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,240
stealing you can still find the video on

618
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:29,550
the beach there's my blue cars feature

619
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:32,230
it's pretty loud and interesting bit my

620
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:34,389
yeah if I took on the chin and

621
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,950
eventually they realized that it was

622
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:40,060
probably a ludicrous statement to make

623
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:42,070
and somebody else happens and Apple and

624
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,960
Bill are chips in there saying that's

625
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,760
probably buying it from their own

626
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,650
personal experience to say that anything

627
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,040
is when I see that contrition that's

628
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:52,090
learning is often a problem is you know

629
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,909
it's not taking yourself too seriously

630
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,970
our time but after them fittings are

631
00:26:54,910 --> 00:27:00,570
very very serious and yeah around

632
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:02,910
but they were able oh yeah fine for what

633
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,939
they originally did and I had a public

634
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:09,720
spot with the then-ceo they went through

635
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,370
CEOs two or three days and marketing -

636
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,530
you make you stop every two days

637
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:16,679
absolute appraiser just don't goof Jorma

638
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:18,360
cap is your product yeah ambassador but

639
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:28,350
in the end they gave us mental health

640
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:33,030
$10,000 which I could confirm warning

641
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:36,270
containment breach there's a couple of

642
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:39,720
things around us we see many CA is being

643
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:42,600
kind of in some form intimidated by

644
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:47,520
let's encrypt I guess they be read a

645
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:50,310
secret is a threat to them which so this

646
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,680
one it was actually joined he posted

647
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:55,470
something online or something about evey

648
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:59,400
sure to remember exactly and these guys

649
00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:01,680
basically check the thread and started

650
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,930
putting their own things on on there as

651
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,490
well as a list of all the 10 reasons why

652
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,190
you shouldn't use the debt in concert

653
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:11,370
and I went through each one and I looked

654
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:15,510
at them and I think every single one was

655
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:17,879
false not to mention the very first or

656
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:20,129
the headline there I pointed out to you

657
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:25,040
let's encrypt and let's just say it

658
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:27,810
followed its own course legal reasons

659
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,159
the story is let's encrypt doing a

660
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,470
fantastic job they're the world's

661
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:35,070
largest CA because they're doing

662
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,930
something great it's free its automated

663
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,970
they've changed the whole landscape of

664
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:40,860
how we deal with certificates and now a

665
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,990
lot of VCS are trying you have to play

666
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,600
catch-up and trying to push things like

667
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,580
easy search which there's a lot of

668
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,800
debate whether the worth of the mat

669
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:56,159
analogy they want to go make up their

670
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:57,990
own minds down yeah but at the end of

671
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,080
the day trying to sell something on

672
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,910
false data or promises or whatever is

673
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,980
just not the way to do business in

674
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,059
you're right and I think if you look at

675
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,080
the open gathered that way

676
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:15,200
the reference British Airways yeah right

677
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:18,269
oh yes keepsake BT possibly but yeah

678
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,919
380,000 VA data compromise was credit

679
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:21,719
card rates it there was nothing to do

680
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,509
with transport layer security was to do

681
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:26,419
with mage JavaScript boys yeah there was

682
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:27,779
JavaScript only behind the scenes

683
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:31,379
nothing at all

684
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:33,090
what says yeah over Jeff and

685
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:36,809
the story so there are good guys out

686
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:38,459
there and heroes there exists the

687
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:42,330
company's up there are fat without that

688
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:44,279
yeah this is trying to experience is

689
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,989
they have not things like robust

690
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:47,789
security controls they are they original

691
00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:50,519
demonstration testing they are engaging

692
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:52,109
that I published coming in help you out

693
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:56,099
we talked about responsible disclosure

694
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:58,289
policies specialist and this is where we

695
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:59,999
both companies are doing a great job I

696
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:01,619
think we should call them out more and

697
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:04,529
put those guys at war because hopefully

698
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:06,059
that will prove to other companies that

699
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:08,429
doing the right thing is actually going

700
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:11,899
to get to you in a battle armor so for

701
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:15,960
example here years a herd of Equifax and

702
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:20,369
knows about the Equifax breach who knows

703
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:22,289
about discuss and the discuss Creech to

704
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:26,309
account the big difference between those

705
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:28,679
two aircraft backs in the reach echo

706
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:30,570
effect how not to handle with the breach

707
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,429
three things on the carpet white blame

708
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,589
and that the jessamine come out with a

709
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:35,519
robust

710
00:30:33,589 --> 00:30:37,918
explanation of what happened what

711
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,929
they're doing going forward it's quite

712
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,309
clear to see how the two different

713
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:44,399
things play out and how your reputation

714
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:46,259
can get happened entity and one gets you

715
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:49,918
cold in front of the US Congress which

716
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:53,070
doesn't seem a whole lot of fun and and

717
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,289
then the other doesn't right yeah okay

718
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:57,418
Pete seems not this year so multi-factor

719
00:30:55,289 --> 00:31:00,570
authentication we talked about this so

720
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:02,190
that's pretty read without me yeah yeah

721
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:05,820
last night things I thought about the

722
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:08,070
show and multi-factor off okay so I

723
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:11,339
think we all we all agree that you

724
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:13,200
should use it you think we should be

725
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:14,950
more we should have a robust approach is

726
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,779
to token based on that cops know

727
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,279
cuerpaso lights agree to an extent

728
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:20,860
without because I think it's not

729
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:22,750
accessible for the masses technically I

730
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:25,029
think it's the trade-off between years

731
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:27,850
ability Institute yeah but I think where

732
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:30,519
we are I'm married into the tire as we

733
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:33,629
increase the market I can reduce the

734
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:36,610
cost in the-- but I'm not gonna roll out

735
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,490
$20,000 fee devices or irrigates to my

736
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:41,918
business but it's just a marriage

737
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:46,240
nightmare that's too much wealth is

738
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:48,580
available then it's bad not the most

739
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,500
ideal then you get okay

740
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,090
so responsible disclosure which we

741
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,070
talked about so they can quickly skip it

742
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,418
though I think do the right things

743
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:59,439
there's anybody familiar with the

744
00:31:55,419 --> 00:32:00,940
security got Texas scheme show house so

745
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,799
it's a web application scheme that's

746
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,570
it's not quite a scam together it's on

747
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,899
which way where you just trust is got an

748

770
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:03,159
business you're going to be you're going

771
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,419
to be doing podcasting so we're not just

772
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:05,860
talking about my destiny web

773
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:07,690
applications are you structurally

774
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,699
network we're talking about fantastic

775
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:12,970
you people you're building who processes

776
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:15,070
everything that they are their attack

777
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:18,940
surface in the though full-time security

778
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:20,980
yes don't we don't be afraid to get a

779
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,390
third PI company to come in and tell you

780
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:27,120
where you're not doing the right things

781
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:29,490
because they are specialists sometimes

782
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,159
that's actually compliant readings yeah

783
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:34,140
an order ability you have 200 sent and

784
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,210
the nice thing though is is that then

785
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,740
you have like a baseline to work from at

786
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,480
a document that will help you build

787
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,840
business cases for the things you need

788
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,970
to fix the problem is your second pen

789
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,899
test right it's never the first one

790
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,670
because the first one will be a

791
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,610
completely demoralizing material

792
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:53,160
the second one is like Oh have we moved

793
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:55,129
the bar anywhere have we actually gotten

794
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,260
better and from a compliance perspective

795
00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:00,270
it makes a really great story for your

796
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,010
business to tell listen we had no

797
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:04,560
security awareness training program we

798
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:06,960
implemented we implemented one good you

799
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,489
know improvement show that improvement

800
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,960
over time it's good to show about the

801
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:11,520
business as well because it aligns where

802
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:16,800
your money's going spending surgeries in

803
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,600
the neighborhood so yeah thanks Gerry

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,580
and how those conversations really up

805
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,290
straight when you when you talk about an

806
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,668
idea well what I do do things a business

807
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,980
right there what securit what the Dead

808
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:28,168
section considerations game on the

809
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:32,699
ground floor this is also all too often

810
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:35,908
this monsoon ok so five mile-per-hour

811
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:38,250
tectum so quickly sure mention driving

812
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:39,899
home have a look at that website put

813
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,210
your email address in your morgue

814
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:44,089
license to get a hit and just quickly if

815
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:46,530
you don't know if you're in the domain

816
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:49,139
putting your domain will automatically

817
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:52,020
notify you and just another thing you

818
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:54,210
can get like the top 5,000 like worst

819
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,949
passwords and blacklist them in your

820
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:58,950
organization through Active Directory

821
00:34:55,949 --> 00:35:01,049
add-on and that lets that means that no

822
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:04,850
one can actually use like the name of

823
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:08,400
your company the heads the password yeah

824
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:09,870
okay so each is a when not if so I think

825
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,700

826
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,290
get you plan your plan in order because

827
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,240
when it happens it's gonna probably feel

828
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,880
a little bit like this but a company

829
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,100
knows what to do we'll be able to

830
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,110
untangle all of that stuff and get to a

831
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,029
point where they follow up basically

832

833
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,750
