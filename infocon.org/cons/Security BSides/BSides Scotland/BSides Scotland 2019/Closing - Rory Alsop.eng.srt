so mentor net built those if you're

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,680

scanner for your car and then if you

the components are relatively cheap

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,630
there's this online instruction so they

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,950
can talk to your car your car can talk

23
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,450
to it you can make your car turn into a

24
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,170
brick and never drive again if you're

25
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:03,420

28
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,460
to do you keep speaking to them if

29
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,898

30
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,500
they do up and down the country and

31
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:12,990

to our speakers you know again without

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,178
them the day is kind of pointless so a

35
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:22,710
lot of us traveled fairly far it's been

36
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:25,499
good having them in here we've had some

37
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,479
excellent talks a huge thank you to the

38
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:29,158
guys in red t-shirts because because you

39
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,710
know they've kind of helped out all day

40
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,270
to make sure this works and broadly

41
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,339
speaking it has there's been your glitch

42
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,109
along the way and we've got it sorted so

43
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,390
thank you guys for giving up your entire

44
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:42,179
day for no money and only a very small

45
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:46,350
amount of boots which is which is pretty

46
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:48,270
small the after party for those of you

47
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,919
who are gonna be taking part in the

48
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,770
capture the flag you want to get across

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,719
to the venue by six ish so that you can

50
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,039
get checked in and so did for everybody

51
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,380
else we want to go there after party

52
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:59,609
turn up there from about 7:00 you're

53
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,658
still getting it's just you wouldn't be

54
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:05,158
part of the competition which is fine

55
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:08,789
next year we're aiming to be back in

56
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,280
Glasgow so we'll keep alternating the

57
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,690
only other thing to say is we need to

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,890
get yanked appear reasonably quickly the

59
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,600
guys in the venue you're going to set up

60
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,929
for tomorrow's event that they've got

61
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,790
going

62
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,010
so what it suggests is if you've got

63
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,328
chats if you can head out and in fact

64
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,560
wandering up towards the venue on

65
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:24,030
Chambers Street is probably a good idea

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,590
if you wanted to go for drinks and so on

67
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,970
but if you can leave reasonably fast

68
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,909
we're going to be tidying up behind you

69
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,019
so that would help beside a lot aside

70
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:33,328
from that just thank you to everybody

71
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,930
for making the day go well and hopefully

72
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:35,930
avoid a good
