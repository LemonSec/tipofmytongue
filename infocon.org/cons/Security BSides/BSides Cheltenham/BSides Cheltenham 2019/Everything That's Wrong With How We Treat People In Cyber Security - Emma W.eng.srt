1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,310
thank you right money everyone I'm good

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,540
to see you here it's a real pleasure to

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,540
be here I'm Emma and I'm head of advice

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,770
and guidance at the moment at the

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,510
national cybersecurity Center based in

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,480
doe not just down the road before being

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,279
head of advice and guidance I was head

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,630
of people centered security research

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,369
also at the NCSC

10
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,140
and that's kind of where my heart still

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,029
lies you know and it's why actually

12
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,289
being head of advice and guidance is a

13
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,060
great job because now I get to interfere

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,919
with all of our advice and guidance and

15
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:30,390
everything else on the website and just

16
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,439
make it all that a little bit more

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,360
people centered so it's great powerful

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,760
role but it's also why I like to take

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,440
every opportunity to come out and talk

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,570
to people such as yourselves about how I

21
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,400
think we often get stuff wrong for

22
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,560
people in security and where we need to

23
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,260
do better and crucially how we can do

24
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:46,760
better

25
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,170
the original title for this talk was

26
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,220
something about burning everything down

27
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,990
but I thought I've scaled it back

28
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,240
slightly that I'll probably get on to

29
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,590
burning stuff down at some point and

30
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,340
usually happens what do I think is wrong

31
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,080
then with how we treat people in

32
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,890
cybersecurity where do I start we tell

33
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,960
them they're really important we say

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,189
everything depends on you

35
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,929
you're crucial you know your first line

36
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:12,060
of defense but then we also tend to say

37
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,409
all you're actually doing a lot of stuff

38
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,299
wrong and then we start thinking well

39
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,039
people are a liability in cybersecurity

40
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,780
really we start calling them the weakest

41
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,499
link and stuff like that we've got these

42
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,149
awkward people why do they assist on

43
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,979
doing things their own ways I'm not in

44
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,600
the security approved why's often

45
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,520
realize they're causing loads more work

46
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,799
they're causing us loads of risk can't

47
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,969
they just do things the right way well a

48
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,109
lot of the stuff that we tell people to

49
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:39,569
do doesn't make any actual sense for

50
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:42,119
them right this is a big claim don't

51
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,859
worry I've got evidence I have lots of

52
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,369
evidence first piece of evidence Exhibit

53
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,619
A for the prosecution this is the same

54
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,840
Exhibit A for the prosecution I've given

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,520
it pretty much every cybersecurity talk

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,920
I've ever given because despite our best

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,319
efforts it's still very relevant anyone

58
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,579
want to have a guess what's like the

59
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:00,929
worst thing the first thing you go to

60
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:05,579
them go to example passwords yes of

61
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:06,869
course it's passwords it's always

62
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:09,508
passwords and this is I always find

63
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,068
passwords a great explainer when I'm

64
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:12,390
meeting people and telling them what I

65
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,560
do for a living because the sea

66
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,030
she said oh well I work in cybersecurity

67
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,090
they go oh and you know I've never been

68
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,069
a tax inspector or a police officer but

69
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:22,209
I imagine they might have similar

70
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,130
experiences of all over sudden people

71
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,239
think you might be there to tell them

72
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,410
off or tell them they're doing stuff

73
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,849
wrong in May said they haven't even

74
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:30,640
realized but that's that's a bit sad so

75
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,980
as soon as I got into but well you know

76
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,569
one of the things I do in cybersecurity

77
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,250
is I think passwords are a bit rubbish

78
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,510
and I'm trying to make it so that you

79
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,860
don't need a million passwords to get

80
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,459
through the day

81
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,069
and they go oh brilliant and they're all

82
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:44,550
friends again

83
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,049
passwords the way we use passwords now

84
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:50,410
in 2019 still kind of amazes me

85
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,200
it's been years I think you know over a

86
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,940
decade since Bill Gates stood up at that

87
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,260
conference and said all the passwords

88
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,600
gonna be dead in ten years and you know

89
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,340
we're now just using more and more and

90
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,310
more of them I think think anyone at

91
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,170
that point anticipated the massive rise

92
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,540
in you a prudent use of the internet the

93
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,940
use of online services retail banking

94
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,910
government services of course people's

95
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,970
use of IT at work has just exploded so

96
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,920
even though passwords are sort of seem

97
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,989
to be a dead issue research-wise you

98
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:22,900
know they're not interesting problem it

99
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,380
goes the belt they're not seem to be

100
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,549
that interesting and people aren't

101
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:28,930
really sort of working on them very much

102
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,910
they're still increasingly relevant in

103
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,390
the world

104
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,950
basically it's now nearly the third

105
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,590
decade of the 21st century and we all

106
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,510
still need hundreds of passwords so

107
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,760
there are a very very live problem for

108
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,450
just about everybody I know in that time

109
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,880
we've been rather slow unfortunately to

110
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,250
catch up with the idea that no one can

111
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,049
really manage passwords the way that

112
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:52,299
we've always told them to up until a

113
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,060
couple years ago anyway for me when we

114
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,019
put our cast password guidance out no

115
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,150
one can do the whole remembering a

116
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,670
billion long strong complex passwords

117
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,200
thing and never writing them down and

118
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,549
making them all different and changing

119
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,530
them every three months no one can do it

120
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,389
when you think about it sort of all

121
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,370
together as a collective impact on years

122
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,650
it's kind of obvious but for some reason

123
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,120
there's some easy to miss continually

124
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,668
day by day when you actually sort of do

125
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,260
the sums on this it makes it even more

126
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,000
obvious and it's always I think worth

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,260
running through this because it really

128
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,160
hits you as the absurdity they're all so

129
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,170
if you have 100 counts which might sound

130
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,490
like a lot but it's not a lot these days

131
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,100
many people I know have 100 200 even

132
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,200
more accounts if you've got to memorize

133
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,780
where which counter is this the bottom

134
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,060
of my facebook however memorize the

135
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,220
username which might be under your

136
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,020
control which will help you make it a

137
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,550
bit more memorable but it might be one

138
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,870
that's imposed on you by work or

139
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,940
whatever so that doesn't help and if you

140
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,030
have just an eight character password

141
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,620
did done in accordance with the standard

142
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,450
complexity requirements of different

143
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,010
character sets enough for a lower case

144
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,580
and you know don't use any of your last

145
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,130
eight passwords and sacrifice a unicorn

146
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,420
before you start and all of that you

147
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,550
know any password anything that kind of

148
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,200
standard and that's only eight

149
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,700
characters which is a long password

150
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,720
these days you know we certainly

151
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,250
encourage people to use longer passwords

152
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,920
than that if you have to remember all of

153
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,710
that stuff for a hundred accounts here

154
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,890
is roughly what it equates to it equates

155
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,900
to memorizing PI to thirteen hundred and

156
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,910
sixty one places and always at this

157
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,980
point I confidently say and I bet nobody

158
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,320
in this room can do that and I say that

159
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,050
unless I'm giving this talk at GHQ okay

160
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,290
probably most people in the room can the

161
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,250
other way of looking at it is like

162
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,650
seventeen decks of cards or shuffle

163
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,960
together and I think you know when you

164
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,970
see out like that you do just go woohoo

165
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,600
yes

166
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,460
these are now really really obvious that

167
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,400
people can't do that so in 2015 now CSG

168
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,230
and CPM I assured are fairly well known

169
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,580
passed my guidance which I'm really

170
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,640
proud that I co-authored and this is

171
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,980
kind of the basic premise to go like

172
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,450
what we're asking people to do up to now

173
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,110
is nuts

174
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,430
we've just got to do something better

175
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,560
something different and everyone went

176
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,170
whoa oh my god you're right

177
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,420
and then they went whoa that's really

178
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,370
sensible practical advice and you'll see

179
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,140
us gee what's going on so when you put

180
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,550
it like this you go oh my god yes

181
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,320
obviously we have to fix this we can't

182
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,870
carry on it's the same old ways but how

183
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,270
did we get to kind of this point to

184
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,610
start this why didn't we fix some of

185
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,110
this along the way why don't we notice

186
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,030
how wrong things were going before it

187
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,860
got to 2015 there's a lot of kind of red

188
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,810
flags I think we've certainly managed

189
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,370
and I've got a few theories about how

190
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,730
which I will talk about I think every

191
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,590
single IT manager in the world is used

192
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,810
to setting password policies and doing

193
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,370
their best to make a policy that works

194
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,500
and being frustrated by the fact that

195
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,780
users just seem to keep so much effort

196
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,639
into getting around them they continue

197
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,320
use your weaker passwords more

198
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,510
predictable passwords they write them

199
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,250
down on post-it notes that they leave on

200
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,620
their desk we're using passwords between

201
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,630
accounts getting really annoyed when

202
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,010
they're forced to change a password and

203
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,169
just adding one to the end all of these

204
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:14,030
stuff that people do that we know people

205
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,400
do and that you can't really stop people

206
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,000
doing I don't think and what is kind of

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,520
funny is when passwords policies get

208
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,620
into this sort of arms race with users

209
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,210
where they trying to develop more and

210
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,980
more esoteric policies to get around

211
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,650
people's ingenuity and tenacity and

212
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,630
defeating them and they say people don't

213
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,000
put effort into security they do when

214
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,470
it's something I want to do like making

215
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,880
a password that actually works for them

216
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,460
people will put effort into that this is

217
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,200
one of my favorite posture policy

218
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,820
examples I'm sorry you're able to see at

219
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,430
the back and I have to apologize in case

220
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,080
anyone in the room was involved in

221
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,900
setting this particular password policy

222
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,669
but it comes from Texas child services

223
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:54,740
website in the USA so hopefully chances

224
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,890
are minimal so you've got all of this

225
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,270
function of clearly quite complicated

226
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,240
rules in small text you know ideally a

227
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,890
possible policy should be the links that

228
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,120
you could read it from the back of the

229
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,820
room maybe not so it must be exactly

230
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,100
eight characters no shorter no longer

231
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,620
one letter one number special characters

232
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,660
special character can't be in the first

233
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,120
or last position you can't use two of

234
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,100
the same characters next to each other

235
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,860
so da da da da it goes on and on and on

236
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,320
and on and there's three things I

237
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,880
particularly love to hate about this

238
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,130
policy the first is that they've given

239
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,750
all these example passwords at the

240
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,150
bottom and one of those break through

241
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,270
all three so even the people who set

242
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,830
this policy are not fun to get hurt

243
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,169
easier to comply with that should sort

244
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,000
of be a hint that it's probably going to

245
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,890
beyond many other people who rock up at

246
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,480
the website to try to use the service

247
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,420
the other thing I kind of love em is

248
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,000
that if you're an attacker looking to

249
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,160
brute force the system and you know all

250
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,870
of these password rules which you will

251
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,100
because I'll get presented to you when

252
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,520
your chance

253
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,530
create an account if you know all the

254
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,450
rules then you that considerably cuts

255
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,340
down the password space that you have to

256
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,530
break so a whole bunch of sort of this

257
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,030
stuff that people have done with best

258
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,520
intentions to try and force people to

259
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,070
make acceptable passwords just ends up

260
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,870
backfiring in ways that people didn't

261
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:19,450
really sort of see but again how did we

262
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,430
how did we get here you know how do we

263
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,750
get to a place where people are looking

264
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,160
at that and going yeah that seems like a

265
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,230
reasonable password policies well I'll

266
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,500
go on to that at this point I would like

267
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,450
to admit that I really struggle with

268
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,700
passwords as well and I think this is an

269
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,320
important thing to admit because quite

270
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,300
often you when people stop talking about

271
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,980
how to fix this kind of stuff they go

272
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,110
immediately into the fix the person mode

273
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,120
then it's go well the issue is you know

274
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,130
the other people are the people they

275
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,140
just need they need more skills in with

276
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,970
passwords and they need more motivation

277
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,890
and they need more awareness of why this

278
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,160
is important and it is not that because

279
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,690
I have all of those things and I

280
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,180
struggle and every single colleague

281
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,220
I know struggles I'm looking at rich in

282
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,390
the fourth row you prepared to put your

283
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,530
hand up and say you struggle with

284
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,350
passwords as well yeah there we go I

285
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,000
don't think this is something we all can

286
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,500
and should admit to because otherwise

287
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,870
it's kind of a conspiracy of silence

288
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,550
okay we're we're all sort of pretending

289
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,170
that passwords are actually fine and

290
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,090
they're not you know I'd use weaker

291
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,470
passwords and I know I should I

292
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,240
occasionally reuse them when I don't

293
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,800
think is going to matter but still it's

294
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,350
not great I write them down in awkward

295
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,180
places until I've got them memorized you

296
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,410
know and then I destroy it but it's

297
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,330
still at risk and like I say every

298
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,250
single person I know does this and I

299
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,420
don't think much is going to get better

300
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,490
until we will start admitting that we

301
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,530
all do this that this is unsustainable

302
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,490
we've gotta do something different so

303
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,380
the way I could have put it now yeah my

304
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,880
catchy slogan that you can read from the

305
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,290
back should be able to read something

306
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,610
from the back right sorry people in the

307
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,590
back path people don't suck at passwords

308
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,410
password to suck for people we are not

309
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,600
going to fix this by trying to fix the

310
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,040
people because you can't fix people

311
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,810
anyway we've got to fix the whole

312
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,440
password scenario so again why is this

313
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,110
kind of so team so surprising as it does

314
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,540
when you lay it out this way why do we

315
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,400
instinctively go to thinking now we'll

316
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,570
know the problem is people bad at

317
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,080
password

318
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,980
you know always gonna be better

319
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,560
passwords well we've had kind of decades

320
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,510
of negativity I think about people

321
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,920
insecurity

322
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,890
we've all internalized the idea to some

323
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,330
extent that people are inherently bad a

324
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,010
security and people are always going to

325
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,899
be a bit of a liability and nothing can

326
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:24,820
be done about it

327
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,200
so why do we think that you know how do

328
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,350
we get that idea I think it's because we

329
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,760
haven't had enough people experts

330
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,660
working in cyber security over the years

331
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,820
when you don't understand why people

332
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,920
behave as they do and why they do things

333
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,450
that you don't think necessarily makes

334
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,880
sense it's easy and you know we all do

335
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,339
it in all walks of life it's easy to

336
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,200
assume that they're being a bit stupid

337
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,899
or they're being awkward or you wouldn't

338
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,370
behave as they would behave if you were

339
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,560
in their situation and in fact it's not

340
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,209
that they were in a different situation

341
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,529
from you they are a different person

342
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,779
different attitudes motivations skills

343
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:02,660
precious and unless you have a good a

344
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,250
good way of understanding all of those

345
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,420
things then you're not going to

346
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,100
understand why they have not behaving as

347
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,680
you want them to behave this is kind of

348
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,839
difficult expert work it's hard and we

349
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,940
haven't had enough of it that's the I

350
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,890
think the root course not that there's

351
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,510
ever a single root cause for anything

352
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,410
that's another that's another

353
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,690
presentation so we've now got this idea

354
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,310
kind of enshrined that it's okay to

355
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,260
blame people for being naturally bad at

356
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,420
security and that's a big problem not

357
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,890
only because it's really burning me

358
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,860
unfair but it stops us finding better

359
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,260
solutions if you're very red any other

360
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,760
sort of Sydney Decker generals for

361
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,380
someone like that anyone who talks about

362
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,190
human error they still say that the idea

363
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,200
of human error is it's a bit of a myth

364
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,290
it's something that will pop up you know

365
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,480
and in an instant investigation process

366
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,910
go why did this rogue go wrong or will

367
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,140
the person press the wrong button

368
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,690
human error that's it end of and no

369
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,850
that's where the work needs to start you

370
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,350
know once you've figured out that all

371
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,880
right the issue was the person press the

372
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,620
wrong button then you can figure out

373
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,420
right okay well maybe the button needs

374
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,730
to be positioned differently or you know

375
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,740
me a different color or something you

376
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,079
can do stuff to help make help humans

377
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,329
make better decisions you don't just say

378
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:15,980
oh well the human mucked it up and

379
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,180
that's it you know that's where the hard

380
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,250
work needs to start but because we've

381
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,870
internalized this idea that people are

382
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,970
always going to be crap

383
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,979
that's often where the thinking stops at

384
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:25,239
the moment and that's we need to change

385
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:29,970
those boundaries that need to push it's

386
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,559
we've actually trained everybody nearly

387
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,999
everybody in the world really officially

388
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:36,759
to think that they are the problem and

389
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,769
that is again another barrier to fixing

390
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:40,929
it we now have this sort of idea that

391
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:42,099
we're going to trip we're going to

392
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:44,109
encourage people to be demanding

393
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:46,749
customers for security we want people to

394
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:48,309
march into John Lewis when they're

395
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:49,899
buying their Internet of Things enable

396
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,579
device and go right does this have a

397
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:53,979
default password and and can I change it

398
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,359
and what how long how long will it be

399
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,369
updated by the manufacturer and we

400
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,569
really want people to kind of do this

401
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:00,729
but again we've spent decades training

402
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:02,109
them in the opposite direction

403
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,909
so not ask any questions and not make

404
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,979
any demands and just accept that

405
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,449
security is not going to work very well

406
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:09,039
I'm not going to work the way they need

407
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,249
it to again this is all kind of quite

408
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:14,499
assertion let's sort of look at how it

409
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:16,629
would work in practice again I'm not

410
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,129
sure how visible this is at the back but

411
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,769
I read some of it helps so imagine

412
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:22,749
you're a regular person like working in

413
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:23,859
accounts or something in a big

414
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:26,439
organization so your whole job is to

415
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:28,599
receive emails with invoices in and

416
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,829
process them and make sure people get

417
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:31,449
paid if you don't do that you're going

418
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:34,389
to be out of the job so what this might

419
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:35,979
be some standard and efficient training

420
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:38,499
that you might go don't don't write this

421
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:40,299
note photograph this for further use by

422
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:42,339
the way I really should put like caveats

423
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,409
on this Lou suffered by those are

424
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:46,389
demonstrating own crappy old password

425
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,189
requirements and I got photographed and

426
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:49,929
put on Twitter as these are the NCS C's

427
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:55,269
recommended password causes anyway but

428
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,419
this is sort of emblematic if some yeh

429
00:14:57,419 --> 00:14:59,559
advice that you might say in many

430
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,079
workplaces how would this look if I ask

431
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,599
no more regular non-expert user was

432
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,819
looking at this really critically check

433
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:10,329
all URLs in the emails oh what's the URL

434
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:13,659
again which one is that oh right right

435
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:14,769
now I got it it's the long one at the

436
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:18,159
top okay so how do I check URL always

437
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,479
the padlock isn't it yeah if there's a

438
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,829
green padlock then everything's fine

439
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:22,659
and they're not wrong we've been telling

440
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:24,129
people for years look for the padlock

441
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,359
and everything will be fine and that's

442
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,799
starting to change but it takes a lot of

443
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,009
time to change messaging decide if you

444
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:34,720
trust your email how do I do is but

445
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,529
assess the

446
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:37,300
strength of its grip when it shakes my

447
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,610
hand do I check if it looks me in the

448
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,350
eye or you know looks a bit shifty off

449
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,680
to the left and I'm poking fun because

450
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,509
it's just the difference between the way

451
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:48,220
this advice is given and the way it's

452
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,259
received if you work in computer

453
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:52,300
security you know exactly what trust

454
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,399
means in that context and you know how

455
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,370
you would check it but a normal I think

456
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,749
keep saying normal people people use

457
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,269
people that's not helpful is it a less

458
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:02,740
technical person who doesn't have that

459
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,839
experience who doesn't know that

460
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,819
definition they're going to approach the

461
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:08,769
idea of trust from their normal social

462
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,410
interpersonal human model of trust all

463
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,430
right we know what that means we don't

464
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,870
ways get it right but we know roughly

465
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,490
how you would go about deciding if you

466
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,519
trust a person and if that's the only

467
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,499
advice that you get on how to trust an

468
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:21,910
email well then you're just gonna try

469
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,620
and apply the wrong word well the wrong

470
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,970
meaning in the different context and

471
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:25,990
it's just not going to work

472
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,769
if in doubt don't click the link well

473
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,120
how do I know whether to doubt the link

474
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,860
and if links weren't meant to be clicked

475
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,499
why they say damn flicky you could make

476
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:37,839
them naw clicky you know you could strip

477
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,639
it all out as it comes in in the email

478
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,019
you can make all the links lock clicky

479
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,759
only you wouldn't do that because it

480
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,319
would drive everybody over the edge

481
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:45,730
you've been really really unpopular

482
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,709
don't open emails that you weren't

483
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:50,860
expecting in 2019 when my job is to

484
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,259
process emails and pay people were

485
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,230
they're gonna get really upset here

486
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,639
don't respond to emails that try to get

487
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,649
you to act urgently right okay so any

488
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:01,389
really urgent invoices that need to be

489
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:02,740
paid I should put those to the bottom

490
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,630
the pile right yeah definitely gonna do

491
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,939
that be really suspicious of email

492
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,520
attachments again that's how invoice a

493
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,679
lot of invoices show up so what do you

494
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,859
want me to do and don't trust macros but

495
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,299
again we're national block them or that

496
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:18,069
would break everything so just just yeah

497
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,839
just be a bit you know don't trust them

498
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,069
and if anything goes wrong it's your

499
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:24,039
fault Eila third they don't trust that

500
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,559
crows one it's like it sure it's is 2019

501
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,970
and if the technology works the way we

502
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,260
want it then yeah there might be

503
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,049
realistic advice but you know work in

504
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:33,490
government most of that still runs on

505
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,899
Excel spreadsheets and somewhere or

506
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:36,070
another I suspect many other

507
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,210
environments are quite similar so when

508
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,919
people get this advice I'd like them to

509
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,590
throw it back and go no I'm sorry but

510
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,570
this advice doesn't work for me I don't

511
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,620
understand the

512
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,150
I don't know how to do what you're

513
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,549
asking me to do and if I did do what

514
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:53,110
you're asking me to do I would probably

515
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,150
lose my job because I would not be doing

516
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,890
key bits of it or I'd be doing them so

517
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,529
slowly that you know my boss wouldn't

518
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,210
wouldn't be happy invoices would not be

519
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,429
getting paid but people don't tend to do

520
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:04,600
that they don't tend to kind of

521
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,480
challenge Mack I think partly it's

522
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,059
because people approach this thinking

523
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:12,279
yes certainly I'm the problem and if I

524
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,929
do click that one bag links and I could

525
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:15,220
bring the whole company down and that

526
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,830
will be my fault well if one person

527
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,570
clicking a bad link can bring everything

528
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,230
down then the person isn't the problem

529
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,490
but they approach this with right yes

530
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,409
okay this is sensible advice and I

531
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:27,880
should be trying to do it so they don't

532
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,409
want to challenge back on that basis

533
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,549
because they think they just need to do

534
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:32,710
better either that or they read it

535
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,210
through more in sort of the spirit that

536
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,890
I've just said and went well

537
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,840
this isn't kind of work so I'll just

538
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,000
kind of quietly ignore it I won't bother

539
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,770
challenging back because it's properly

540
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,590
might change anything and I have a job

541
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,570
today so they just kind of discard it

542
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,480
and go on their way none of that is the

543
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,250
intended outcome of this advice that's

544
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,630
not going to make your organization any

545
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,390
safer at all and you cannot simply

546
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,950
change pay our people respond to this

547
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,299
advice by telling them is really

548
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:02,130
important this the advice has to change

549
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,330
all gosh running short of time already

550
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:09,730
our news is gonna happen right so that's

551
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,929
a lot of slugging everything off from

552
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:12,610
burning everything down how do we make

553
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,169
it better

554
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:16,090
tons of ways I'm going to put a load of

555
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,460
words up now that you don't often see up

556
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,720
on the screen when people are giving

557
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,880
presentations about cyber security that

558
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,990
in itself is the problem listening to

559
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,460
other people I have mentioned this

560
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,490
before consider that your point of view

561
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,350
is not the only point of view and the

562
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,730
other people's points of view are just

563
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,830
as valid as yours this sounds really

564
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,539
patronizing and lecture II and I hate

565
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:38,710
having to kind of say at this folks

566
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,260
everyone knows this but you know it is

567
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,570
hard to do in practice it means getting

568
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,399
out and asking people what they think of

569
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:46,870
your work what do they think of your

570
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,399
advice does it actually work for them

571
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:50,679
and being prepared to hear back no this

572
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:52,210
doesn't work for us and we need to do

573
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,039
something different which is never easy

574
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,419
to hear but it is absolutely essential

575
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,760
because if things don't work in practice

576
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,780
for the people they're supposed to work

577
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,590
for they're not going to work

578
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,149
I'm trying to sort of apply this

579
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:05,190
principle in NCSE advice and guidance at

580
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,659
the moment and by trying to sort of

581
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:08,639
incorporate more points in the process

582
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,409
where we get feedback from customers

583
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,090
about what they think of our guidance

584
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,220
sometimes even before we've published it

585
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,679
we'll send out for an extent all of you

586
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,899
and then see what people think and in

587
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:20,249
the nicest possible way this is slightly

588
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:21,809
baffling some of my colleagues they're

589
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:24,120
like what we're gonna let other people

590
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,549
tell us what good NCSC guidance looks

591
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:28,740
like no we're the experts we tell them

592
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,440
that's how this works but it's not how

593
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,840
it works or rather if you do it that way

594
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,759
it's not going to work as well as if you

595
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,559
put the audience front and center of

596
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,389
what you're doing because if the advice

597
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:43,189
doesn't work for them it doesn't work

598
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,590
empathy and emotional intelligence again

599
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,029
it's not something you'll cease listed

600
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,619
in the sort of standard job description

601
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:52,019
anywhere in security but it's really

602
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,789
really crucial so this is sort of

603
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:55,740
listening to the next level but actually

604
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,749
really caring about where other people

605
00:20:57,749 --> 00:20:59,759
from are coming from and really wanting

606
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,610
to fix things from their point of view

607
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,559
so I think a certain extent some people

608
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,029
are more empathetic than others but it's

609
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:07,649
something you can learn you know you can

610
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:10,350
work on you can develop advanced

611
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,059
questioning skills and listening skills

612
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,460
to help Peter to help you build trust

613
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,169
with people and to encourage them to

614
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:18,360
share their real issues with you it can

615
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:24,269
be done we can do better at it you see

616
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:27,210
respect this is kind of yeah something

617
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,039
of everything that I've already said

618
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,629
really just sort of remembering that

619
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:32,610
other people's perspective is just as

620
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,289
valid as yours they have different

621
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:35,490
knowledge than you they don't know

622
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,360
everything that we know about

623
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,490
cybersecurity and that's okay because

624
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,779
they have a day job when they know loads

625
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:41,629
of stuff that we don't know it's fine

626
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:43,619
attitudes yeah people have very

627
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:46,139
different attitudes to security we've

628
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,970
kind of like it if we thought security

629
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,440
was really important to everyone but the

630
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,240
fact that it's not and it's not going to

631
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,220
be security is not the reason most

632
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,320
people come to work they come to work to

633
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,269
get their job done security is like a

634
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:58,619
barrier that they have to get through in

635
00:21:58,619 --> 00:21:59,909
order to get the job done it's not an

636
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:01,700
end in itself

637
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,409
we again this is something we've sort of

638
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:06,539
butted up against it was partly when we

639
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:07,950
were thinking of sort of how to approach

640
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,470
boards how do you get boards engaged

641
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,759
with the whole topic of cybersecurity

642
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,350
and we're sort of the thing is you have

643
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,299
to persuade them that it's gonna affect

644
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:18,490
their bottom line if they don't care

645
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,679
about security and that's sort of the

646
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,190
main way to get people to care and pain

647
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,510
people in my neck of the woods are sort

648
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,559
of wringing their hands and going Oh

649
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,000
what they should care about security for

650
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,309
its own sake like yes that'd be lovely

651
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,679
but it's not gonna happen so let's

652
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,179
consider how to do this in the real

653
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:38,470
world biases everyone has biases no

654
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,059
matter how hard you work on biases you

655
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,530
always have what everyone does it's fine

656
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,030
you just have to be aware of them and

657
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,460
work around them and try to compensate

658
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,590
for them largely by incorporating people

659
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,150
in your thinking whose point of view is

660
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,330
different in yours same team again

661
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,220
different motivations and drivers this

662
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,929
one comes up an awful lot because it

663
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:57,190
sort of is something you really need to

664
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,390
consider when you're asking anyone to

665
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,940
spend time doing a security thing like

666
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,289
well that time isn't going to come from

667
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:04,570
nowhere they have to take that time out

668
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,919
of time that they would spend doing

669
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,020
their job or - otherwise time that they

670
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,280
would spend doing something that they

671
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,530
care about if you want them not to do

672
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,120
any of that and do your security thing

673
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,860
instead yeah it's gonna have to be

674
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,700
really compelling there's a quite famous

675
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,100
paper and people sent a security called

676
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,559
the compliance budget which i think is a

677
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,720
powerful idea it says that people have a

678
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,760
finite amount of effort to do security

679
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,150
and compliance type stuff at work and so

680
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,650
it's like any other kind of budget and

681
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,480
you have to treat it that way you have

682
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,340
to is better if you consciously decide

683
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,320
where to spend it because when it's gone

684
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,960
it's gone and we're not used to I don't

685
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,730
think think thinking of people and

686
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,330
security that way all the time

687
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,039
from precious yeah everyone is under

688
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,840
pressure at work so I can go to be

689
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,640
sympathetic and think what's going to

690
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,200
work for the people that we need it to

691
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,360
work for and if you're the one who

692
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,980
really cares about doing the security

693
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,539
thing differently you can have to put

694
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:00,640
most of the legwork in which is a pain

695
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,140
when many security departments are

696
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,419
under-resourced and underfunded and

697
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:06,669
demoralized I know none of this is easy

698
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:08,620
but I think thinking about it is some of

699
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,780
the way forward

700
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,740
oh yeah so all of this is quite intense

701
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,320
detailed work it takes time it takes

702
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,809
skills to do it really well and it's

703
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:21,900
definitely far more than just awareness

704
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,850
people often talk about awareness in

705
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,670
cybersecurity with or without the hands

706
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,860
and I think they think it's this sort of

707
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,690
magical process of far more than it

708
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,370
really is so there's something like this

709
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,870
perhaps you know you take your ordinary

710
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,030
person your player wareness to them and

711
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,190
suddenly everything is amazing only it's

712
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:44,770
luck because everything is exactly

713
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,330
exactly in your left for the pumpkin and

714
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,770
some icing you're like great yeah

715
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,000
totally so I think you know with the

716
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,350
best will in the world many people who

717
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,150
talk about oh yea security awareness as

718
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,950
a way of fixing things don't appreciate

719
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,929
the complexity of what that actually

720
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:01,000
involves when they're talking about

721
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,620
awareness I think often they're they

722
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,650
really mean something more like this

723
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,000
this is a model I take from the mind

724
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,620
space paper produced by behavioral

725
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,690
insights team it's just one of many

726
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,520
available models if you don't like this

727
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,320
pick another one it's fine but it gives

728
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,840
you some idea of how complex it really

729
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,940
is to try to get people to change what

730
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,340
they're doing it's not just giving them

731
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,290
new information and expecting them to

732
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,510
internalize it and process it create new

733
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,120
attitudes and new habits it's or taking

734
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,040
all of these things into consideration

735
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:36,340
as well you also have to consider

736
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,429
barriers to change this is something

737
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:41,230
again you it's easy not to think about

738
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,580
when you're setting out on your project

739
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,660
and you're going to change the world you

740
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,040
know it's great you're bought into it

741
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,570
it's all going to happen you don't want

742
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,650
to think about the things that might

743
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,660
stop it happening but there are many

744
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,940
things I could stop and then can this is

745
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,530
a model that has nothing to do with

746
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,970
cybersecurity I think it's about

747
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,760
increasing rates of participation in

748
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,950
physical health activities among young

749
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,870
people in South Africa but again it

750
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,730
gives you the idea there is all these

751
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,470
sorts of things that can get in the way

752
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,000
of the positive change you want to make

753
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,770
and if you don't take that stuff into

754
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,299
account then the change you want isn't

755
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:12,429
going to happen and if you don't realize

756
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:14,020
that this is why isn't happening again

757
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,860
it's time to conclude that the people

758
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,090
are the problem they're just being

759
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,880
awkward there's a lot more to it than

760
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,530
that but I would never deny that people

761
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:27,130
can be awkward obviously I had something

762
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,630
else really important to say about that

763
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,919
on a totally forgotten

764
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:42,599
right so I'll charge swiftly on because

765
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,070
then have a couple of minutes anyway

766
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,229
the last point respect all professional

767
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:48,809
expertise in cybersecurity factoring

768
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,969
tech law widely I think like I said

769
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:52,499
earlier we haven't had enough people

770
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:54,419
centered experts and security up till

771
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,820
now and the ones I do see there even now

772
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,489
I quite often see being sidelines and

773
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:01,919
ignored and their expertise is not

774
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,779
treated with the same respect the same

775
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:06,089
gravitas as more technical expertise

776
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:08,190
some knobs around the room say yeah this

777
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,320
is recognized and we need to need to fix

778
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,359
it and see I see we're doing our best to

779
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,039
fix it you know we've sponsored lots of

780
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,509
research in this area we've spent a lot

781
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,459
of money on it over the past 10 or so

782
00:27:17,459 --> 00:27:19,289
years and we've been really lucky to

783
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:20,879
work with experts like Angela Sasser

784
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:23,359
like Lizzy Coles Kemp Adam joined Sun

785
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:25,619
I've been heavily influenced by Cormac

786
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:27,809
Curley at Microsoft as well and work

787
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:29,609
directly with him there are tons and

788
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:30,809
tons of people who are really good at

789
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:32,309
this and we just need to listen to them

790
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:35,009
more it's 20 years ago now for Angela

791
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:36,599
Sasser and and Adam was published that

792
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:39,629
seminal paper users are not the enemy 20

793
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:41,549
years ago you know of course it takes

794
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:43,200
time for research to come into practice

795
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,239
but that's still a really long arc where

796
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:46,950
you know we're nowhere close to taking

797
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:55,829
all those ideas on board yet so I think

798
00:27:55,829 --> 00:27:59,399
that is more or less almost it I'm going

799
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:01,950
to close with a quote from one of my

800
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,749
team she just happened to sort of say

801
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,099
there she wrote on slack actually last

802
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:07,919
week I was yeah yeah that's kind of a

803
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,349
lot of what I'm trying to do here so

804
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:12,329
it's not saving passwords which is a

805
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:13,469
really difficult message to get across

806
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:15,209
to people so what we're trying to do

807
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:16,739
with cyber aware at the moment of people

808
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:18,359
are just not having it we spent so long

809
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,799
telling them not to write pass this down

810
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,959
they're like nope just don't believe you

811
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,729
now so quite frustrating but we'll get

812
00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:26,070
that so people don't feel storing

813
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,320
passwords is safe but people do it

814
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,219
anyway quite a lot but it feels like

815
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:33,839
something shameful it feels like

816
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,219
something they have to do because there

817
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:37,139
are weeks you man being you know it's a

818
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:38,190
fall back they don't have any

819
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,539
alternative and they're not proud of it

820
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:42,119
be proud of it I say possum it's a crap

821
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,309
you're not crap passwords are crap any

822
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:46,499
coping mechanism you can use to help you

823
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:48,329
get through the day is fine really

824
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,429
really is and that's what I'd like to do

825
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,049
is turn around those perceptions of

826
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:53,260
people as being

827
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,900
we and a security liability rather than

828
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,429
people are actually great you know

829
00:28:57,429 --> 00:28:58,570
people are the only thing that make

830
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,580
anything work at all in business in

831
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,650
organizations in government have people

832
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,390
we wouldn't have anything really so

833
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,040
let's turn those perceptions around

834
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,870
let's make people and more positive

835
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,059
force in security and let's be more

836
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:11,679
demanding about the security that we

837
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,690
want people to use in everyday lives we

838
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,100
want security that works for them

839
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,110
because security that works doesn't work

840
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,380
for people does not work and that is all

841
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,679
for now
