1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,949
yeah my name is Graham Simpson I'm going

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,110
to talk to you about the art of the scam

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,839
or you don't know how lucky you are to

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,269
have so much bureaucracy she's probably

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,519
not something here every day so everyone

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,139
is familiar with the concepts of

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,109
scamming I guess pretty much everybody

8
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,320
in unfortunate enough to be part or at

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,210
least witness to a scam at some point in

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,560
in their lives

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,869
it just seems an inevitability that

12
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:26,640
somebody will try and take something you

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,349
have by means of a con so today I'm

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,329
going to give you a brief tour of my

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,700
experience living in the modern cultural

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,129
home of the scam in Nigeria so I spent

17
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,649
about seven months give or take working

18
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,960
in Nigeria over the course of a year

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,440
working for ExxonMobil as part of their

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,739
security team so many internet scams

21
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,500
seem to originate from the Nigeria it's

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,449
become kind of bit of a joke in itself

23
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,090
it's amazing how many Nigerian Prince's

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,160
there are out there just willing to give

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,960
away their millions to some unsuspecting

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,210
new friends via email so these scams

27
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,070
even have a name that originates in

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,490
Nigeria before 1/9 scam for 1/9 refers

29
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,400
to a section of the Nigerian criminal

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,970
code specifically the type of scam where

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,790
somebody promises you something big a

32
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,220
large amount of money but in order to

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,659
get that you have to give them something

34
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,320
small so it's it's it's a very common

35
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,049
scam so in the example of our Nigerian

36
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:36,180
prince he'll happily send you those

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,880
millions but in order to do so you have

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,759
to grease the wheels with some sort of

39
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,680
small amount of bribe to somebody or

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,320
it's a it's a checking fee or or some

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,640
sort of administration fee which is

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,680
probably only a few hundred maybe a

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,479
small number of thousands of dollars

44
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,970
probably in order to get your millions

45
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,340
which of course you'll never receive

46
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,899
you'll pay your money and the chances

47
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,700
are you'll never hear from them again no

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,200
weight of course you will hear from them

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,579
again because as soon as you've shown

50
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,829
yourself to be stupid enough to hand

51
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,719
over a little bit of money they'll be

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,489
back at you for another small thing or

53
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:08,818
another

54
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,739
you know another increment which but you

55
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,940
know don't worry you'll get your

56
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,950
Millions which of course you won't

57
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,690
and if you think this sounds ridiculous

58
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,300
and that nobody nobody would possibly be

59
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,130
stupid enough to fall for this sort of

60
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,560
scam remember that people are stupid

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,750
enough to fall for this sort of scam and

62
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,450
in quite large numbers the fact that so

63
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,810
many scam emails exist is testament to

64
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,670
the fact that they work and it's worth

65
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,100
the effort of the scammers to put these

66
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,430
things together the way the things it is

67
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,500
for most of us and hopefully everybody

68
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,450
here that the emails themselves are

69
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,940
typically riddled with mistakes the fact

70
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,950
that they even just mentioned Nigeria is

71
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,200
enough to set alarm bells ringing off

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,150
for everyone and you think well if

73
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,519
they're so obvious to sport you know why

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,500
do the scammers even send them when

75
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,880
they're so glaringly obvious well

76
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,860
actually they do it deliberately they

77
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,690
send the emails with the mistakes with

78
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,880
the mention of Nigeria or Cote d'Ivoire

79
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,440
or other countries where you might

80
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,190
otherwise be suspicious but by doing so

81
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,010
and if people then still take that to

82
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,940
the next step

83
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,560
they'd be French essentially select

84
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,019
themselves they've passed that bar of

85
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,630
stupidity that the the scammers are

86
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:27,180
looking for so what is the reality of

87
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,010
living in Nigeria really like

88
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,079
particularly when it comes to scams well

89
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,329
for one I was not routinely approached

90
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:36,269
by a fine-looking gentleman in regal

91
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:38,790
regalia trying to offer me millions of

92
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,930
course it's that's not really going to

93
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,269
happen but the reality was almost that

94
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,530
obvious on arrival my first arrival in

95
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,790
the country obviously step off the

96
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,910
aeroplane I was I was weary I was aware

97
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,359
of the scams but I thought I would see

98
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,489
them coming and as long as I was careful

99
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:58,109
I kept my eyes peeled I'd be alright I

100
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:00,780
kind of treated it rather like a tourist

101
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,640
in a Turkish bazaar my hands in my

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,459
pockets I sort of looking around in case

103
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,720
I accidentally buy an expensive carpet

104
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,549
but it turns out I was pretty wrong

105
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:12,870
actually I was wrong about everything

106
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,548
and the way it all worked so it would

107
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,798
seem in Nigeria that almost everything

108
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,470
seems like a scam on some level and the

109
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,190
reason for that is that the line between

110
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,760
doing regular business and

111
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,060
is is somewhat blurred so to give you an

112
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,390
example I was subjected to a scam almost

113
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:40,240
every day at breakfast as I've lived in

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,970
hotel this one here which was company

115
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,190
owned and run so this is an exxon mobil

116
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,380
hotel every morning I'd go downstairs

117
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,840
and a rather bored looking waitress

118
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,520
would come over and she take my order

119
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,410
and I'd sound like scrambled eggs please

120
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,120
on toast and she'd write down

121
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,430
scrambled eggs toast sausages and bacon

122
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,320
okay so he goes and takes the ticket

123
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,240
over to the kitchen gives it to the chef

124
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,980
who'd make up the breakfast

125
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,410
ding ring the bell waitress goes over

126
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,750
collects my breakfast only she doesn't

127
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,850
bring it straight over to me quite

128
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,800
blatantly in front of me and the rest of

129
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,750
the restaurant should walk over to a

130
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,460
little bit at the side and scrape off

131
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,290
the sausages and the bacon and any other

132
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,540
extras into a little bag or bowl that

133
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,460
was ready waiting shuffle everything

134
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,460
round and then bring me my breakfast

135
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,430
I've got what I ordered ExxonMobil well

136
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,890
they've made what they think they

137
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,690
expected the only person in the

138
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,310
organization that's got scam is Exxon

139
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,960
but they've lost out on what a sausage

140
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,040
who cares

141
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,620
it's no one does anything about it so

142
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,910
I'm already scammed I've only been a

143
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,380
breakfast but technically it's not me

144
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,630
that's been scammed I'm there I'm kind

145
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,910
of involved but really I'm more just

146
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,640
more just along for the ride and that

147
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,840
happened in the hotel from the very

148
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,790
small but also right on the very big

149
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,660
scale as well so the hotel had some 64

150
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,120
rooms in total and officially I hope

151
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,860
what I heard was there was about a

152
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,110
hundred and sixty five members of staff

153
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,220
to look after those 64 guests there was

154
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,220
apparently a squash coach and a tennis

155
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,020
coach there was even one person whose

156
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,060
sole responsibility was to look after

157
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,800
all the VHS recorders in each of the

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,860
rooms I said there have been old they

159
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,050
did actually really do really did have a

160
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,120
couple of Life Guards but on the one

161
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,980
occasion that somebody did actually get

162
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,150
into trouble in the pool it turned out

163
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,650
they couldn't swim so they weren't much

164
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,290
caught either

165
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,900
what it meant was there was well over a

166
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,940
hundred members of staff who were

167
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,250
fictitious they didn't exist somebody at

168
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,530
the top of the organization was creaming

169
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,840
off salaries for over a hundred people

170
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,280
the secret to the success of these scams

171
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,620
of course was that they never directly

172
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,180
affected the expats all of the foreign

173
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,670
workers such as myself as as I had

174
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,100
expected before I arrived we were just

175
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,140
along for the ride and pretty much

176
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,340
helpless to do anything about it so how

177
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,190
can this be I hear you ask well how can

178
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,990
a very sizable company like ExxonMobil

179
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,180
and their big like fifth in the world or

180
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,560
something they're an enormous company

181
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,070
let such criminality from the tiny right

182
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,690
up to the grand how can they let that

183
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,510
exist well they were as far as I could

184
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,080
see two main causes firstly there was a

185
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,420
problem with contracts the problem was

186
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,390
that they were terrible for example a

187
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,150
company might be employed to build a

188
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,970
walkway a walkway like this one I think

189
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,350
you might be wondering why I've got a

190
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,300
picture of a walkway in my photo album

191
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,880
as part of the security team this is the

192
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,330
queue up to one of the terminals to get

193
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,340
out with an access control card and it

194
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,050
rains a lot over there so it's a covered

195
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,970
walkway so people could queue up so

196
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,710
bizarrely this falls under the remit of

197
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,250
the security team so the company doing

198
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,930
the build would be given a certain

199
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,190
amount of money upfront and they'd

200
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,900
receive staged payments throughout the

201
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,440
process of building the walkway company

202
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,600
would obviously progress a certain

203
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,060
certain way through this but they get to

204
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,610
a certain point where they realize it

205
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,650
was actually better off for them

206
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,690
financially to take what money they'd

207
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,550
already received and walk off the job

208
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,130
with it unfinished naturally you know

209
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,510
why pay for the rest of the work to be

210
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,730
done keep the cash Thanks so they walk

211
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,550
off leaving the job unfinished as you

212
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,070
can see only and this is the best bit

213
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,049
there was nothing to stop this company

214
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,299
from rebidding on the next contract

215
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,460
which inevitably came out to go bad can

216
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,349
finish the job that they'd already been

217
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,299
at least partly paid for for doing in

218
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,820
the first place and this happened again

219
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,010
and again there were lots and lots of

220
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,880
project

221
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,280
where there was repeated contract cycles

222
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,470
in order just to get the job done once

223
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,460
the second main reason there

224
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,470
everything's like where the things work

225
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,990
like this is because ExxonMobil just

226
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,820
want to get the oil out of the ground

227
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,210
onto a ship and away they grease the

228
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,640
wheels just enough to allow this to

229
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,270
happen for them trying to change local

230
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,610
culture would have been an expensive and

231
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,460
frankly fruitless endeavor so they just

232
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,100
don't bother so for the geographically

233
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,710
challenged that's Nigeria over the sort

234
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,660
of right hand side dish making up quite

235
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,450
a large chunk of the coastal countries

236
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,910
of western Africa down there and I was

237
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,620
based in a small town called Eket which

238
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,330
is marked with the with the red dot

239
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,750
there we zoom in a little bit echo

240
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,060
itself is that red sort of circle ish

241
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,320
blob and where I worked was the oil

242
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,970
staging facility down there in the

243
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,160
bottom right hand corner so i zoom in

244
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,900
and that's the that's the oil staging

245
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,760
facility and zooming a bit further

246
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,760
around that particular little blob is

247
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:03,380
that now that is some free electricity

248
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,970
sort of actually this is what this is

249
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,590
really an example of his collective

250
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,010
stupidity but it's a glassful app so

251
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,870
these things are thankfully very much

252
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,780
restricted now since I was there all the

253
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,360
oil that they collect is quite curious

254
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,100
crude oil but it's mucky at that point

255
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,770
they have gas which is relatively

256
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,380
expensive to process so they don't they

257
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,050
just burn it off what you don't really

258
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,240
get from this picture is and it's an

259
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,830
idea of the scale of this thing it looks

260
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,900
like a slightly oversized Bunsen burner

261
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,630
but it is absolutely huge you would feel

262
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,520
the heat on your face from this thing

263
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,470
from well over 100 metres away this is

264
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,660
bigger than any bonfire you've ever been

265
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,540
near it's enormous

266
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,490
it's a staggering amount of energy just

267
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,420
to just a burn off just a waste an exxon

268
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,950
came up with the idea of turning this

269
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,590
thing into a mini power station and to

270
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,180
generate electricity and as part of a

271
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,760
hearts and minds exercise they survived

272
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,400
great

273
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,160
we'll give this free electricity to the

274
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,060
locals because it's waste for us but in

275
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,160
order to do that they need to build

276
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,910
pylons between the the oil staging

277
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,270
facility and the main town ekit in order

278
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,920
to get those pylons there they had to go

279
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,380
through the tribal areas of seven

280
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,930
different local tribes and they had to

281
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,520
go to each of the elders each of the

282
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,950
tribal elders and say to them we'd like

283
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,540
to put these pylons down we're going to

284
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,010
give you free electricity and we'd like

285
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,230
to give you the work to put these pylons

286
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,130
on your land so each of them three

287
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,740
electricity and paid a brilliant what

288
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,910
could possibly go wrong

289
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,790
only each and every one of the local

290
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,500
elders each of the chief said exactly

291
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,550
the same thing

292
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,230
that they didn't just want the contract

293
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,600
for the pylons that went over their land

294
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,300
they wanted the contract for the whole

295
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,610
lot from start to finish which meant

296
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,920
exxon would be paying seven times the

297
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,440
amount of money to pay somebody to give

298
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,170
them then free electricity which was a

299
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:02,680
stalemate

300
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,000
excellent didn't want to pay over the

301
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,380
odds for something they thought was a

302
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,480
gift anyway and the Chiefs wouldn't

303
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,520
budge either so the whole project was

304
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,860
shelved nothing ever happened

305
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,860
what a waste the whole area was littered

306
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,990
with examples of failed projects and

307
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,360
unfinished buildings like this one this

308
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,770
is right next door to the hotel we

309
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,750
stayed in and you can see a bit of the

310
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,010
niger delta and the jungle behind it but

311
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,020
this was part of the course every third

312
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,850
or fourth building in nigeria seemed to

313
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,930
be unfinished and it wasn't like they

314
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,640
were busy working on them they were just

315
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,830
they're crumbling back into nothingness

316
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,380
so a root cause of a lot of these

317
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,610
problems is one of identification and

318
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,130
not just of people companies

319
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,140
organizations etc are all uniquely

320
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,540
identified in the UK so that they can be

321
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,910
tracked and monitored and administered

322
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,300
an individual who misbehaves while

323
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,250
working as a company director can be

324
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,529
barred from being a company director in

325
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:08,170
future by Companies House there is a

326
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,180
single source of trust for limited

327
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,589
companies which is which is Companies

328
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:12,550
House

329
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,070
and companies house themselves can

330
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,810
identify all of the individuals by

331
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,520
things like passports or birth

332
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,680
certificates lots of these things that

333
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,050
we have trust in we have trust in these

334
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,060
these things these documents and these

335
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,880
organizations without really ever really

336
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,320
knowing about it we've got that trust

337
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,850
and it's there and it's built-in and we

338
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,589
just work with it it's kind of by

339
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:36,160
default we don't really realize what

340
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,510
we're doing either that we have

341
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,010
confidence that when we're talking to

342
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,779
somebody when we're asking them to do

343
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,190
things and in particular when we've got

344
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,500
contracts that largely people will do

345
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,250
what they say

346
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,260
because we've got this trust built in

347
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,420
and even then when things go wrong we

348
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,140
still have a very robust court system to

349
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,750
fall back on which hopefully will we'll

350
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,320
sort things out when these things are

351
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,260
removed it becomes incredibly hard to

352
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,690
rely on things that frankly we take for

353
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,850
granted starting with this trust in

354
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,470
identity so where would you start to try

355
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,600
and change this as a country level well

356
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,470
sadly you can't change it in a hurry

357
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,640
individuals doing the scamming aren't

358
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,380
necessarily all that bad really they

359
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,420
simply operate within their cultural

360
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,329
norms certainly a local level they're

361
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:26,680
just trying to survive at life like

362
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,020
everybody else indeed most locals I

363
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,120
spoke to pretty much condemned the

364
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,620
scamming they don't like it and they

365
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,360
don't like the inevitable waste it leads

366
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,560
to so next time you're complaining about

367
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,170
bureaucratic processes like filling in a

368
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,089
bank form or a passport application or

369
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,220
even rushing to get your tax return in

370
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,550
on time don't remember that don't forget

371
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,849
you are incredibly lucky thank you

372
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,420
[Applause]

373
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,450
any questions

374
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:09,700
so how does the decision come about this

375
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,810
is acceptable lot probably no really

376
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,510
happy one inning of the use oh no Franco

377
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,050
yeah yeah like where do you as you're

378
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,209
saying that sorry the metaphor yeah how

379
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,670
do we will find that source of authority

380
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,770
did the desires to be a hundred

381
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,810
no one ever sees other thing we never we

382
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,270
never let anything slip but you know

383
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:39,100
clearly in this situation yeah I don't

384
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,600
know how you'd measure how much is

385
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,640
acceptable certainly whether or not it's

386
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,550
profitable the weird thing is the the

387
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,870
Nigerian government treated quite

388
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,220
differently to pretty much every other

389
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,790
oil-producing country in that if you go

390
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,330
to places like Saudi or the Middle East

391
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,240
they will just basically buy in

392
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,220
expertise and slave labor and just take

393
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,839
the checks thank you very much they just

394
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,120
take the oil money and don't really get

395
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,029
involved with with Exxon and all the

396
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:09,070
other oil companies operating in Nigeria

397
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,899
and actually operate an adjoint company

398
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:12,610
so it wasn't actually X on its mobile

399
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,399
producing Nigeria it's a joint called

400
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,829
joint organization sixty percent owned

401
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19,630
by the Nigerian government and only

402
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,700
forty percent owned by Exxon and they

403
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,730
supposedly work jointly together to to

404
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,279
do things which is why you end up with a

405
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,060
lot of scamming within the organization

406
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,860
itself because there are people frankly

407
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,370
that shouldn't be there but Exxon are

408
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,779
obliged to have that in place so yes

409
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,700
they minimize it but they're stuck with

410
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,620
the system that they can't get out of

411
00:16:44,620 --> 00:17:04,750
but they still do it well sometimes it's

412
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,429
political so it's give an example one of

413
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:09,339
the facility actually doesn't produce

414
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:11,359
the other about twelve

415
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,160
oil rigs out to sea and they just pipe

416
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,099
it back to where I worked at one point

417
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,349
one of the oil platforms all of the

418
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,150
national or the local workers went on

419
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,849
strike which meant they were down more

420
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,500
than two-thirds of their workforce and

421
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,750
they decided as a company they would run

422
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,030
it with a skeleton crew made up entirely

423
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,970
of foreign workers and with all of the

424
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,220
Nationals missing the productivity of

425
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,180
the oil rig shot up and can you imagine

426
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,340
how keen they were to break the strike

427
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,050
not very at all but they've still got to

428
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,570
because it's all it's owned mostly by

429
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,670
mobile producing Nigeria so yes somebody

430
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,440
in the Accounts Department will say keep

431
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,730
that going as long as possible and

432
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,530
somebody in a more super diplomatic

433
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,870
position will say actually we do have to

434
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,129
negotiate and have to keep things going

435
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,090
and they make the money elsewhere so

436
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,740
crude oil relatively speaking is not

437
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,780
worth very much it has to be refined

438
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,490
before it's worth a lot of money so they

439
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,650
ship it off to someone like someone like

440
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,080
Doha they process it there and then it's

441
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,770
worth more money

442
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,960
the bizarre thing is that Nigeria's like

443
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,940
fifth or sixth oil-producing country in

444
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,770
the world because they ship out crude

445
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,200
and they in them import to refined oil

446
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,450
or actually it's a net loss financially

447
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,000
on oil but the government doesn't want

448
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,800
the citizens to kind of be aware of that

449
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,340
so they subsidize fuel at the pump so

450
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,320
petrol is cheaper than it should be so

451
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,450
it feels like it's really good this is

452
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,830
why I went on twe doing well actually

453
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,380
financially they're losing money on oil

454
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,260
Nigeria is losing money on oil Exxon

455
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,180
because they're processing it elsewhere

456
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,090
there yes more than happy thank you very

457
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,630
much about the one minute flag so I

458
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,530
think we're all done thank you

459
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,590
you
