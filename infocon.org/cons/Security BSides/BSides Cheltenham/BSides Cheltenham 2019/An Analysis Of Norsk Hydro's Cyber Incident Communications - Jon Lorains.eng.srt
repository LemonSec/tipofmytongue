1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,790
well welcome everyone today on part 2 of

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,560
the click at cyber corporate away day

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,529
following on from the so V it's gonna be

4
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:08,550
slightly different talk something a bit

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,960
funds regulators what we do but not

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,219
really is a topic I was interested in

7
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,019
and went off and hopefully I see that

8
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,490
it's got a bit of a story behind it

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,480
which I think follows on from the

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,630
previous one Graeme just went through

11
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,910
it's entirely about PR communications

12
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,930
whatever we're gonna do how did you

13
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,029
respond to an incident so yes I'm going

14
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,320
to skip through the first bits quickly

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,519
because actually squad was to get in and

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,720
I wanna get the video in which is the up

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,430
kind of highlight first where he'd

18
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,809
actually heard of the North kaiju attack

19
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,840
and see the video excellent it's not

20
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,180
even in the room they're pretty unusual

21
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,829
put this way if you haven't have heard

22
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,110
about it they did what everyone else

23
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,090
couldn't do in tends not to do which is

24
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,440
actually communicate effectively and

25
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,050
transparently during innocent so gonna

26
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,460
go through who they are quickly the

27
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,230
incident and then what we can learn from

28
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,149
it I'm not an expert it's all about

29
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,320
getting information out there discussing

30
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,360
it if you think I'm wrong let's have a

31
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,100
chat about it no one's got the perfect

32
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,719
answers and then while we discuss things

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,730
and more we learn questions if we're

34
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,689
very lucky because of time constraints

35
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:08,760
Toby said so we are the big I did we do

36
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,720
cyber exercise and we help people

37
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,460
prepare the way you get better is you

38
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,350
exercise you train mind you a hearse

39
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,689
coming into this PR and communications

40
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,580
is only one bit of it it's not and say

41
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,840
it's a call of our offering

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,670
we're not PR experts but this is

43
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,540
something that kind of caught my

44
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,080
interest when we're looking into this so

45
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,939
the approach of the analysis how

46
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,000
inverted commas probably useful it's a

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,070
focus on the response not the cybers so

48
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,630
we're not really interested in which bit

49
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,369
of malware got into what system and what

50
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,290
it did it's entirely what there's a

51
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,560
company an organization put out to the

52
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,470
media or to their organization and it's

53
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,390
done through that lens all we can see

54
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,950
and all I've been able to see is what

55
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,110
could put onto public means they've

56
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,810
since released a follow on video about a

57
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,540
month ago which only fight about

58
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,100
recently because I wrote the article

59
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,040
first a while ago and that explains some

60
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,689
of their internal motivations but most

61
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,670
of this analysis is done from what did

62
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,560
they dump on Twitter Facebook and their

63
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,330
websites and also the videos and the

64
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,520
other things they did

65
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,880
it's a dataset of one so take what you

66
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,550
take that picture salt also we can't

67
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,620
comment really on the internal

68
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,570
motivations the follow-up video done a

69
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,130
month ago does give some insight into

70
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,270
that but obviously I could say what they

71
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,090
want and the spirits of the analysis

72
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,220
when I first did this natural title that

73
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,390
I submitted I thought it wouldn't be

74
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,830
brilliant fun to go in laugh at load of

75
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,030
companies who are bad at instant

76
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,710
response comms and we could put some

77
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,910
messages that I look at this isn't this

78
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,360
awful

79
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,550
aren't we brilliant but I had a bit of a

80
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,510
grown up moment I thought those

81
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,100
particular helpful I'll try and be

82
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,320
positive and let's look at the good I

83
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,020
think we all know what the bad is and

84
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,550
quite frankly often the bad in

85
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,200
communications was just nothing or a

86
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,120
one-liner comment so there's actually

87
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,000
that much to talk about really there is

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,460
a bad example in here just to give a bit

89
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,960
of context I initially have named the

90
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,630
company in there the name isn't the

91
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,040
article I've linked to this it is all

92
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,130
still in there I'm not going to mention

93
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,620
them in this they're not the focus the

94
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,390
other reason why I thought it was unfair

95
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,250
to go for them is even a company is

96
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,140
having a bad incident there's probably

97
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,420
people working 20 hours a day not seeing

98
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,580
their families there are people in teams

99
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,160
working their backsides off none of that

100
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,140
might come out and be presented in the

101
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,480
public relations face for those people

102
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,070
are still having a pretty bad time so

103
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,730
laughing at them would probably not be

104
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,170
probably it's not a grown-up way of

105
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,340
approaching things that was my kind of

106
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,380
grown-up moment which lasted about three

107
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,480
minutes so everyone time to get north

108
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,820
character who are they company I've

109
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,530
never heard of before when his company's

110
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,970
that kind of does huge things around the

111
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,800
world he never heard have founded 1905

112
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,840
fully integrated LM in your company so

113
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
they do everything from digging out the

114
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,810
ground turning it from bauxite into

115
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,600
aluminium all the way through to making

116
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,000
profiles so funny shaped bits of

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,290
aluminium that could then go off to be

118
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,580
made into a window frame or something

119
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,450
and then everything in between 35,000

120
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,190
employees 40 countries bear that in mind

121
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,330
this has a relevance for how you

122
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,360
communicate and obviously quite a few

123
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,330
revenues in terms of what they do also

124
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,250
anyone recognize that now might be

125
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:19,779
generational

126
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,970
I love watching old films here is a

127
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,800
Telemark Second World War

128
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,020
norsk hydro or hedgerows they announced

129
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,990
it they ran a heavy water plant which is

130
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,169
part of the Nazis nuclear program

131
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,480
effectively the sabotage by Norwegian

132
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,070
commandos I've been a bit of British in

133
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,410
there somewhere but also that was active

134
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,240
this is the same company basically they

135
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,650
have power generation they'll stall

136
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,230
iminium and that's part of their infamy

137
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,200
all that kind of history it's still part

138
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,460
of that kind of core culture which is

139
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,550
quite interesting so the incident began

140
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,310
stuff this year end of March it

141
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,600
basically took everything out it was a

142
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,360
target around ransomware attack and it

143
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,310
took the entire enterprise network out

144
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,290
they still had email because that was in

145
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,590
the cloud but basically everything from

146
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,390
the factory floor from the computers

147
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,770
telling them what to print what to

148
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,640
manufacture next through to sales all

149
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,510
that kind of good stuff

150
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,710
everything was gone basically we'll see

151
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,870
no now softly sometime after it but the

152
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,220
cost that they've stuck on it and then

153
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,479
they reported to the Norwegian stock

154
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,820
exchange is basicly 50 million pounds

155
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,470
there might be a bit more obviously

156
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,120
programs they introduced to poly gonna

157
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,430
bring that cost kind of further into the

158
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,860
future so so my clicking goes here I'm

159
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,140
going to take a quick run through look

160
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,430
at the kind of delve into a few of the

161
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,860
things they did and then try and look in

162
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,810
more detail to the press conferences

163
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,960
they did and also the video they did so

164
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,610
it detected overnight on the 18th the

165
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,729
19th of March first communication was it

166
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:54,370
essentially 9 o'clock so that's 10

167
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,070
o'clock Norwegian time so within

168
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,030
potentially a couple hours of the start

169
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,490
of the working day they had something

170
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:05,440
out and that was it that was just a on

171
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,590
Twitter just saying we're having issues

172
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,870
we're under attack go look at Facebook

173
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:16,050
for our communications just as an aside

174
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,510
that was the

175
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,960
from the day before so that is a kind of

176
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,060
welcome present for a new CEO that I

177
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,630
don't think anyone would really want to

178
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,410
serious points and that's a par from

179
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,000
kind of thinking it's been fortunate for

180
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,680
her and they already have this to

181
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,660
establish Twitter presence they didn't

182
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,310
have to start up a twitter twitter feed

183
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,320
they had an audience on there already

184
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,900
same also for their Facebook account

185
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,940
that they had an audience be at their

186
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,400
internal workers and their customers

187
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,080
potentially so that was one thing they

188
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:54,800
had in place the other reason that is

189
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,840
also that was them going out saying

190
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,190
we've been hit by attack this is an

191
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,750
alternative way of an attack being

192
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,580
announced to the world by crabs

193
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,310
reporting it as a organization you have

194
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,710
a choice which one you want to do if

195
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,000
you're going to go for an open approach

196
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,400
you want to be in there first instead of

197
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,870
waiting for the media to do it for you

198
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,670
and then I'll give you from then on

199
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,190
you're untrustworthy you have a lot of

200
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,630
trust to regain if someone gets out

201
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:25,700
before you so they had essentially the

202
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,040
same morning that was a kind of 1992

203
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,380
websites stuck up on his year probably

204
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,060
someone's credit card I don't know the

205
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,520
exact details again the website had just

206
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,310
been completely flattened they got

207
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,570
something up they gave a bit of

208
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,100
information and obviously provided

209
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,780
people with somewhere to look again

210
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,400
phone numbers for kind of investor

211
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,490
relations media and then basically one

212
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:53,840
else gets Facebook please so I'm pretty

213
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,090
much from the off the assumption is

214
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,070
pretty early on I'm not sure if they had

215
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,900
a canned incident response plan that was

216
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,900
always to go with this approach but very

217
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,730
early on in that first morning names to

218
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,750
decided we're gonna have a press

219
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,660
conference so that is what they did

220
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,500
that's afternoon so in the sense you've

221
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,700
got the chief financial officer so

222
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,140
that's essentially the number two of a

223
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,440
company with the CEO changeover that's

224
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,060
probably why he took the lead for it as

225
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,410
opposed to the old CEO who's probably

226
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,390
off playing golf or the new one who

227
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,980
didn't know which way was up because

228
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,440
they just started on the left is the

229
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,200
head of PR and communications and on the

230
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,190
right is a

231
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,890
lady from the Norwegian ncsc effectively

232
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,620
so within finding out on a Tuesday

233
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,809
morning they've gone through got a few

234
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,799
things out on the Internet

235
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,000
they've then held a press conference

236
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,830
this afternoon and got someone from the

237
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,480
NCSC effectively to tip up at that press

238
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,740
conference so as a example of influence

239
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,920
and power that is a thing that most

240
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,750
companies perhaps couldn't do or not in

241
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,520
a position to do arguably if you're a

242
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,020
big company you should be able to do

243
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,610
those things if you need to pull those

244
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,680
levers you can't just do that overnight

245
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,230
you have those relationships in place

246
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,640
the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is

247
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,080
also a major shareholder in the company

248
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,720
so that equally might be why they have

249
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,570
that representation um especially after

250
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,320
that press conference um frequency was a

251
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
key one of their kind of motives they

252
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,970
went full they had the next day and

253
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,880
morning updates Saturday - they had

254
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,170
another press conference advertised

255
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,420
again they used Twitter and Facebook to

256
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,640
advertise these conferences out they had

257
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,200
a press conference just after lunch on

258
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,410
the second day as inside that a new

259
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,510
website up and running on day 2 at 3

260
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,380
o'clock which they were lucky but that's

261
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,270
a reasonably impressive thing to get the

262
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,500
wheels turning and get something out the

263
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,700
door and it was a proper website as well

264
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,760
not just a kind of who's your plus

265
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,100
special and then the weekday updates

266
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,780
followed on from that so just to give

267
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,010
you an example of the kind of things

268
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,260
that the week so that the weekend they

269
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,060
didn't put anything out but they did a

270
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,130
mixture of updates in terms of this is

271
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,050
what systems are still affected but they

272
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,360
also had pictures of people these are

273
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,950
faces from their subsidiaries I think

274
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,460
this is a Spanish subsidiary basically

275
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,680
saying here's how the attacks ongoing

276
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,450
and look at real people real faces this

277
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,430
is a corporate PR machine there's people

278
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,110
getting on there's bits of paper out

279
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,490
there maybe even as a whiteboard

280
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,260
involved one of these and people are

281
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:27,800
getting on and making things work and

282
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,470
there's a bit of

283
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,570
of corporate this is a bit more kind of

284
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,880
corporate and kind of pyaari

285
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,850
you have basically I could call that's a

286
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,190
kind of to our employees well done

287
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,890
aren't you doing well whether they are

288
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,060
or not people are putting the hours in

289
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,980
and working and they used the

290
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,410
opportunity this is a week later of

291
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,510
eight days later

292
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,100
that's the outgoing CEO a bit of kind of

293
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,170
nice imagery and it turns up in people's

294
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,750
feeds nicely later saying we're really

295
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,090
proud of you as a as a company and after

296
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,620
that's mainly aimed at the internal

297
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,530
employees or they you can say from an

298
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,660
external outsider's point of view that

299
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,240
gives you an impression of how they kind

300
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,050
of deal and view their employees the

301
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,580
highlighted isn't imagine it's the main

302
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,840
for those people who put their hand up

303
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,280
and said yes they've heard of this I

304
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,960
imagine the main reason why you said

305
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,980
that is because you probably heard about

306
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,960
the video would that be correct

307
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,470
I don't think I'm not aware of any other

308
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,350
company kind of post incident that is

309
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,570
then put a YouTube video out explaining

310
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,000
their response they've put another one

311
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,880
out more recently I hopefully the end

312
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,950
will have time to watch that but this

313
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,840
was a semi glossy it's been

314
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,240
professionally done but as in the camera

315
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,740
works nice it's not done with someone's

316
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,260
iPhone but it's just people it just

317
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,520
talks to the people on the factory floor

318
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,980
the person who who found it first it

319
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,150
does a bit of a vignette about a

320
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,940
production worker and it isn't the

321
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,740
corporate speak of the company saying

322
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,360
this is what we did the stories told

323
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,210
through the people which hopefully if I

324
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,280
talk quick enough you'll see for

325
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,810
yourself I've seen because it was so

326
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,280
unusual then got picked up and kind of

327
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,410
InfoSec Twitter and I'll see replayed

328
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,610
hurling as probably where a lot of

329
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,110
people have heard about it from and I've

330
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,550
seen it was a thoroughly unusual thing

331
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:22,200
to do just give you an idea that was

332
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,970
just a kind of top-line summary this is

333
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,160
I went went through and basically across

334
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,950
all the medium recorded every single

335
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,360
thing they put out to each one of those

336
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,940
bullet points is something that they put

337
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,110
out so that say over the course have

338
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,330
kind of two and a half weeks so so

339
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,670
they're key when the key principles the

340
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,900
two of them with transparency in

341
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,650
frequency

342
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,880
that's the

343
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,160
a frequency they went for nothing over

344
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,140
the weekends because it was a weekend

345
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,390
you could argue they had enough updates

346
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,260
they were happy with what they were

347
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,490
doing they just did Monday to Friday

348
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,800
updates at the start of the day largely

349
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,870
and then giving the detail that they

350
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,000
felt was necessary and available at that

351
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,730
time

352
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,600
so yeah the other thing that's very

353
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,250
apparent from the start is the style of

354
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,340
how they actually communicated in their

355
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:11,070
statements so let's have a look at this

356
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,720
is not North hydra this is someone

357
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,690
else's incident i think if you read

358
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,420
through this as i'm talking this is very

359
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,100
much your generic we've had an incident

360
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,280
there's a bit of a narrative at the top

361
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,480
which is describing how it's also

362
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,760
terrible and it's telling what has

363
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,500
happened but it doesn't tell it enough

364
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,830
detail that it's useful to anyone to

365
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,510
have any kind of reassurance about the

366
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,630
incident they apologize for being unable

367
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:41,070
to send a tweet and their pologize also

368
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,650
for the inconvenience this company was

369
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,940
providing a service that people were

370
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,100
reselling so at no point there have they

371
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,450
provided any information that would be

372
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,540
useful to their clients to pass on and

373
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,980
brief people apart from it's still

374
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,470
broken so it's I'm sure someone who is

375
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,180
very skilled in PR has written this and

376
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,560
probably a lot of effort went into it

377
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,830
but it doesn't actually give you any

378
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,890
reassurance the peace the bottom it's a

379
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,530
classic we've seen no evidence of I'm

380
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,870
sure we've all seen the statements that

381
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,190
come out saying at this time we've seen

382
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,990
no evidence and then the car crash

383
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,850
unfolds over the following months when

384
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,470
it turns out that everything went out

385
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,390
the door yes they didn't have any

386
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,730
evidence at that time but those kind of

387
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,320
statements don't have any weight unless

388
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,060
you describe what steps you've gone

389
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,740
through to establish that conclusion so

390
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,500
if you can say we've been through logs

391
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,130
are x y&z systems we've looked at these

392
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,750
systems we've had these people in

393
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,030
they've done these tests and after a

394
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,500
week of doing that we've seen no

395
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,410
evidence then you might have a bit of

396
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,600
confidence to assert that just saying

397
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,360
you haven't seen the evidence it's I

398
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,360
said some doesn't really give you much

399
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,140
compare this to nos hydro it reads like

400
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,550
something for my kind of World War 2

401
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,740
battle report everything is a fact

402
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,310
is no conjecture is like we've been

403
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,840
attacked this has happened

404
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,490
I think practically every one of those

405
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,190
sentences is a fact even that's the one

406
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,360
that says we don't know anymore at this

407
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,240
point and they just go through and they

408
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,740
basically they're not trying to

409
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,320
underplay it they don't apologize

410
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,110
they just say we don't know the full

411
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,060
impact at the moment and we don't know

412
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,800
how long it's going to take so that

413
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,800
level of kind of brutal honesty I think

414
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,690
is very much in stark contrast to the

415
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,870
typical style of messages that companies

416
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:34,110
put out like this one now Tony obviously

417
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,370
this is all played out on social media

418
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,650
therefore people responded to it the top

419
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,500
one is from North Skye Joe and this was

420
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,930
very much it's one tweet amongst many

421
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,910
but lots of people I assume from both

422
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,650
inside and outside the company we're

423
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,640
saying well done this is a really

424
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,590
positive response you're doing compare

425
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,720
that to the bottom one from a company

426
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,880
didn't do so well which you could argue

427
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,920
yes your plan may never work properly

428
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,230
but you've got these social media tools

429
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,180
out there if you see that your response

430
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,750
is doing badly the failure is not making

431
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,730
a mistake initially and the failure is

432
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,740
they're not changing your communications

433
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,600
plan when you can see that Twitter is

434
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,400
burning or your Twitter feed is bursting

435
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,530
into flames and that's something surfing

436
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,990
that company the bottom didn't have an

437
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,860
ability to change their strategy an

438
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,060
old-fashioned press conference I think

439
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,280
potentially might be seen a bit dated in

440
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,220
the kind of modern era but I think it's

441
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,430
very much it worked very well a bit of

442
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,170
interest we don't have time to watch

443
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,750
this it's links up there'll be a link

444
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,920
going up on Twitter that you can go and

445
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,300
look at this they're all still in line

446
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,750
which is quite interesting the CFO chief

447
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,240
executives talking about cybers is often

448
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,670
quite an excited topic and he was either

449
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,320
incredibly well informed well briefed or

450
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,940
the approach the he took was not to talk

451
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,400
about the technical detail what he did

452
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,600
was very well he's a chief financial

453
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,040
officer he's the chief accountant

454
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,800
effectively of a business

455
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,020
he knows business units performance off

456
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,970
the back of his hand that is his job is

457
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,410
to know performance and business and

458
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,640
that's what he talked about

459
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,619
he was like business unit a has lost

460
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,299
this much capacity business you

461
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,099
B has lost this much and he's a

462
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,648
world-class expert being a CFO of a big

463
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:16,109
company so he stayed within his comfort

464
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:19,679
zone and he does he performs very well I

465
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,888
say it was completely there may be legal

466
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:25,138
reasons or the insurance why couldn't

467
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:26,749
actually talk about the actual incident

468
00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:29,369
but by not going into it not speculating

469
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,289
they avoided all the questions such as

470
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,869
were you running XP they were just

471
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:35,190
focused completely I don't know if they

472
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,480
were over like it just focused

473
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,070
completely on the impact to the business

474
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,330
and what they were planning on doing

475
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,619
about it in the next kind of 24 hours

476
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:47,369
overtime and then yet the follow-up

477
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:50,909
video I say attracted a lot of attention

478
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:53,489
um I think having seen the follow-up

479
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,039
video they did a month ago I think this

480
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,769
was I think most of their communications

481
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:00,989
throughout when I mentioned the scale of

482
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:03,989
the organization 35,000 employees you've

483
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:06,330
just lost all your IT yes he still might

484
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,649
have email which might get you

485
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,509
communications to a manager in each

486
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:11,940
plant if they've got a computer which

487
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,609
they didn't the decision for them to go

488
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:16,019
with the approach that they they went

489
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:17,999
with was how else can you communicate

490
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:20,119
with 35,000 people of 40 countries and

491
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,289
the only way for them to do that was

492
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:26,970
through Twitter social media I believe

493
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,330
so most of their cons I think were done

494
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,259
excluding this video were done for that

495
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:34,710
purpose this video you could argue it

496
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,109
was actually people weren't really hard

497
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:38,879
let's show off to the world our

498
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:40,739
corporate values and the way that we

499
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:42,210
handle this they would have got a whiff

500
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,739
that they were potentially responding

501
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:49,169
any new and well commented well kind of

502
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,619
well praised infoset kind of ways so

503
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:54,869
this might also be for external kind of

504
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:57,570
consumption the key thing note when we

505
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,889
go through hopefully is I see the

506
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,359
content not the medium I think just

507
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:02,850
rolling out a video isn't going to be

508
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,739
the solution it's the content that they

509
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:06,960
have in there of showing real people

510
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,489
dealing with it and it takes away the

511
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:11,820
anonymous corporate our security has

512
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,249
completely fallen on its backside so

513
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:16,139
people were doing workarounds people

514
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:17,700
with clipboards people with piles of

515
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,340
paper and it brings a human face so a

516
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,139
horrible time effectively and I think

517
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:23,250
that changes the per set

518
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,590
and outside a house on it instead of a

519
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,720
15 lines of some kind of canned

520
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,550
statement that's been through League

521
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:37,380
legal and fit and PR 15 times so lessons

522
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,510
identified I think is about half a dozen

523
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,800
things I kind of picked out of this

524
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,930
which I think are kind of useful but

525
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,880
I'll see based on a kind of case study

526
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,530
of one you do need to prepare north were

527
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,730
lucky that they had communication

528
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,780
channels in terms of their the Twitter

529
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,000
accounts that was kind of well all the

530
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,290
kind of good corporate stuff people get

531
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,060
being given awards that kind of stuff

532
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,880
there baton Facebook that I assume that

533
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,680
a large proportion of our employees were

534
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,820
on whether they wanted to or not they

535
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,080
had that available that was a tool that

536
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,520
they had they couldn't have started that

537
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,740
up overnight and normally if you start a

538
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,730
Twitter feed up the day after after an

539
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,470
incident the first question is how do we

540
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,390
know this is real so you need to have

541
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,830
that kind of infrastructure if you like

542
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,580
in place prior to something going wrong

543
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,840
in terms of preparation you'll need to

544
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,730
work out what your worst case is for

545
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,820
your clients so norsk essentially is a

546
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,480
heavy industrial company it's basic knot

547
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,740
killing people that's their main

548
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,410
priority so all of their focus and all

549
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,030
their reporting all of their priorities

550
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,920
was about essentially health and safety

551
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,390
we're happy that no one has been killed

552
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,510
that's our main priority is employee

553
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,000
safety after that we'll do security and

554
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,930
money the other company is a software

555
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,970
company that providing just having the

556
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,410
insight in Goenka we provide software

557
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,620
that goes to people that then provide a

558
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,930
service with that software what are they

559
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,910
going to need from us when it goes wrong

560
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,520
what do they need to be telling their

561
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,140
clients so that we can keep them happy

562
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,900
so just going through and game of flying

563
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,240
or kind of rehearsing and thinking what

564
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,590
would happen in the worst case scenario

565
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,160
we'll help you prepare and speeds off

566
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,480
you'd be the first to report don't get

567
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,890
crab don't get crabs

568
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,970
Krebs it doesn't need to be much that

569
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,860
the first line that they put out was

570
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,240
whatever a line and a half of a tweet

571
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,080
organizationally in a company who's got

572
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,310
the permission to put out is a lot more

573
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,960
complicated so actually sending out a

574
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,580
tweet for a big organization is not a

575
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,700
simple thing

576
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,559
how'd you do that and you want to be

577
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,739
there before the media is facts

578
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:43,840
obviously say what you know and what

579
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,129
you're going to do about it

580
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:47,289
don't do the we take your security

581
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,600
really seriously or any other kind of

582
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,369
fluff because people do see through it

583
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:53,109
straight away people are remarkably good

584
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:56,320
at spotting marketing fluff and it will

585
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,090
just damage your credibility from the

586
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,210
off a couple more and then gets watch

587
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,029
something yet react if you see it's

588
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:06,340
going wrong social media Twitter good

589
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,539
thing about using those channels is you

590
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:09,249
get the feedback straight away it's not

591
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:13,480
working change it be human get the faces

592
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,309
out there that works both for the

593
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:17,080
outside looking in but also your team

594
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,379
like people you are working for you I'm

595
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:21,609
not seeing their families because of the

596
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:23,859
incident at least give them some kind of

597
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:26,100
face show the hard work they're doing

598
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,629
which leads on to the next one sorry the

599
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:30,489
bottom one jumping ahead they'd be proud

600
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:32,019
if you've got people killing themselves

601
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,929
working 18-hour days try and get your

602
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:35,919
company back on its feet

603
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,499
that norsk and retired people come back

604
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:40,960
in without being asked they're the kind

605
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,340
of things that you want that's corporate

606
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,470
culture and ethos that consultants get

607
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,359
paid millions to try and engender if

608
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,909
you've already got it be proud of it get

609
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,850
out there and make make it an asset and

610
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,700
obviously be honest no matter what you

611
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,960
do to prepare you're gonna have lost

612
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,779
some trust you can either be non

613
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:00,399
transparent through the incident or you

614
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:03,340
can just go yep we made a mistake and

615
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,989
start rebuilding that trust from day one

616
00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:11,940
right more interestingly this is a

617
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:19,450

658
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,750
productions after witness at the oil in

659
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,090
the alto Sangeeta so you'll be my till

660
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,220
boudoir how I made the difficult divine

661
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,500
diggy diggy dog

662
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,389
so nephews does my Ptolemy leptin Tyler

663
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:11,490
water I told my children my dog so some

664
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,020
time I left already

665
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,150
[Music]

666
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,020
14 ability area - what room - Lou :

667
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:26,290
Emma we can share mom take mister

668
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:00,790
[Music]

669
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,730
so I think from that I I saw you don't

670
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,600
think any of the companies produce

671
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,330
something quite like that oh dear off we

672
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,480
go again

673
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,050
yeah the seconds video if you just go

674
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,950
they have since in a follow-up video

675
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,660
explaining their motivation so if you're

676
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,060
interested I'll suggest YouTube norsk

677
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,740
hydro and you'll find I think there's

678
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,230
one minute to spare any questions for

679
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:46,470
one patient medical mind that wonder

680
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,140
what the public to know them to doesn't

681
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,790
be helped knowing no one who plotted the

682
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,480
Internet's no doubt sir isn't returning

683
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,190
corrective so how you see things of the

684
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,990
CFO in that press conference was either

685
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,570
form that has stuck to what we do so how

686
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,480
would you bring that in to say that you

687
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,430
know if something like this happens not

688
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,480
scrambling to put in insulator I know

689
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,150
how do you do it almost like a column or

690
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,680
warm situation where something like this

691
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,040
could happen

692
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,830
yes it's good question

693
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,810
culture and changing companies and

694
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,370
organizations is not an easy thing to do

695
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,880
I think they from the start when we're

696
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,950
going to do this transparently and

697
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,090
that's very practical they had to

698
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,040
communicate all those people and they

699
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,780
probably wanted to maybe try something

700
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,610
different how do you you say not sort of

701
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,590
my enjoys you need to know you're the

702
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,850
culture of your organization they spit

703
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,160
out and connect did you audience your to

704
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,060
your customers so if you're a an ISP you

705
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,560
probably you want to focus on the people

706
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,760
but you're actually you probably would

707
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,170
want to be getting the technical detail

708
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,490
out because your audience the only way

709
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,740
you can get their trust is through the

710
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,250
technical detail I have that answer so

711
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,840
that's so I think we crunch at the time

712
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,490
I have another time for another very

713
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,380
short question or my no that's it no

714
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,100
right thank you very much
