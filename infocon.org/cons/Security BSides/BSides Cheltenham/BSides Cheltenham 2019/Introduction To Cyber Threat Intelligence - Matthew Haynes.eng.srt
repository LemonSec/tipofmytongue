1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,878
so I'm taste opportunity to thank

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,160
b-sides champion for having me along and

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,649
also take the opportunity to say anyone

4
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,650
here from NCSC thank you very much I've

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,730
been working with a lot of small

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,549
entities very recently and they've been

7
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,670
Dossi understand the whole what I asked

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,140
me on getting involved in as well so the

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,730
feedback from the ground level guys who

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,439
really try to defend their businesses or

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,039
even just themselves they really need

12
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,689
that direction so the stuff that NCS you

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:28,710
are doing I just want to take that

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,970
opportunity so thank you very much for

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,759
that so I'm Matt Heinz and I'm here to

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,710
give you a introduction to threat

17
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,629
intelligence this year I've been going

18
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,670
to a number of other b-sides events and

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,070
I've been providing a workshop titled

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,920
wTF is CGI or cyber threat intelligence

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,520
I'll use the term cyber threat

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,829
intelligence and threat intelligence

23
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:53,430
synonymously throughout this

24
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,680
presentation like I personally feel that

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,129
CGI exists within the wider threat Intel

26
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,730
and you have a fiscal element as well

27
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,040
but that's one of the presentation so I

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,650
did the workshop with the intention to

29
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,299
tell the community what I feel

30
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,729
threat intelligence should be I have a

31
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,200
perception that there is a incorrect

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,290
understanding of what it is from either

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,400
a lack of understanding what

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,770
intelligence should be and also maybe

35
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,390
what's being given from a marketing

36
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,280
perspective so I gave the workshop in

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,869
trying to give my view on what it should

38
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,220
be to help the community so we think

39
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,479
intelligence we have to think military

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,799
intelligence so you probably can't read

41
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,720
at the back what we've got here is some

42
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,750
perceptions what strangest think I do a

43
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,360
guy with a an assault rifle on my family

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,369
thinks I do a bunch of screens in a

45
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:48,990
command center James Bond what my

46
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,079
recruiter said I would do Jason Bourne

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,770
what Hollywood thinks I do what I think

48
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,700
I do presenting to generals to stars etc

49
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,350
but in reality what I actually do is I

50
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,630
do PowerPoint so what your perceptions

51
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,000
hopefully some of you saw the agenda and

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,949
and knew this was up and maybe you

53
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,569
already have some perceptions of what

54
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,980
threat intelligence

55
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,629
is maybe you just think it's another

56
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:17,190
acronym certainly a lot of them in our

57
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,400
industry maybe just a marketing

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,810
buzzwords something to actually get hold

59
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,140
of your budget and spend something maybe

60
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,280
it's just googling maybe you got some

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,989
threat Intel analysts who just kind of

62
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:30,420
go on google and tell you bad stuff is

63
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,930
happening somewhere doing something

64
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,190
maybe it's repeating news personally

65
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,239
this is something that I've got a bit of

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,620
a bug about I often see people

67
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,200
presenting or providing intelligence and

68
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,849
all that kind of telling me is something

69
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:44,549
that I would read in the news so a hack

70
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:45,810
has happened somewhere and this is

71
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,180
what's happened very high-level that's

72
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,160
just news that's not really intelligence

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,450
doesn't allow me to do anything and

74
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,579
we'll go into in a bit maybe it's just a

75
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,410
threat Intel feed maybe it's pointless

76
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,170
bio C's because got a nice small

77
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,340
audience I'll try make a little bit

78
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,230
interactive so do feel free to two inch

79
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,140
at any point on that point is anyone

80
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,849
here who just purely has a threat

81
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:08,840
intelligence feed into their environment

82
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,610
very cool so so I see that quite a lot I

83
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,160
certainly see things like Google's DNS

84
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,519
being a bad bio see the realities is an

85
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,620
indicator it can be an indicator but on

86
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,690
its own doesn't necessarily means benign

87
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,850
but from the workshop what I found

88
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,500
actually most of all people didn't

89
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,670
actually have an idea they didn't

90
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,900
actually have any perceptions they

91
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,850
didn't really know what threat

92
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,310
intelligence was which gives me sort of

93
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,660
two things from that one is that's great

94
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,609
we can build on that and there's an

95
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:43,440
understanding or this is a want to know

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,450
what it is so we can we can work with

97
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:45,660
that

98
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,910
and the other takeaway that I had in the

99
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,250
the workshops that I was doing is people

100
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,170
wanted to know more so the workshops for

101
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,880
two hours basically was an introduction

102
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,170
it's coming the bits we're going to talk

103
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,239
about today but it also did some

104
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,430
exercises and tried to get me start

105
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,069
thinking like an analyst an intelligence

106
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,069
analyst but also a little bit of social

107
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:07,109
security research and hunting

108
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,780
capabilities and in that two hours

109
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,579
people said it just wasn't enough so and

110
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:15,840
the other day what's the whole point of

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,548
this what's the benefits to me my

112
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,380
organization its knowledge injection or

113
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,570
also not just 19 Jackson but your

114
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,620
hypothesis is injected into your team

115
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,400
well why is that you're getting to

116
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,020
direct the forces so you've got your

117
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,640
sock guys or get the incident responders

118
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,130
or your your penetration to your red

119
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,500
teaming or or your forensics guys you're

120
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,610
helping them to actually look at the

121
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,610
most likely avenues of threats not to

122
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,980
waste time that actually is not really

123
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,040
applicable to your organization you get

124
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,560
to really focus on something so in this

125
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,080
in relation to an incident response if

126
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,700
you're guys something just gotten bang

127
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,170
and everyone's hands on deck in the

128
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,910
tryna understand what's going on time is

129
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,860
a big issue you want to actually get

130
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,510
them looking in the right location and

131
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,920
in a particular piece of malware a

132
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,870
particular attack to focus on what's

133
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,330
actually applicable and ultimately what

134
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,380
you're doing is you're reducing their

135
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,750
time to recovery that's one of the key

136
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,250
benefits of threat Intel to your IR team

137
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,540
but that's tactical intelligence I'll

138
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,100
talk about that in a moment

139
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,740
you have a couple of other areas

140
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,510
operational and strategic and that's

141
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,220
helping with the preemptive stance of a

142
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,860
force things gone bang

143
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,360
you'll be injected with knowledge and

144
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,300
understanding a theory on likely threats

145
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,560
and you actually put in the right

146
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,180
controls you spending the right money in

147
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,560
a time and the effort and the limited

148
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,020
resources we all have in the right

149
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,690
places ten times multiplier hmm threaten

150
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,150
tell is definitely a force multiplier

151
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,470
it's there to actually feed into other

152
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,480
teams on its own doesn't require any

153
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,330
value but with other teams enhances

154
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,220
those teams there's a paper that came

155
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,390
out or maybe it was a sales go up blurb

156
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,400
that basically did say it's up to ten

157
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,260
times not sure I quite agree with that

158
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,700
volume but I certainly do think it's

159
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,720
multiples so therefore threat Intel is a

160
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,810
team sport and when the analyst

161
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,190
intelligence analyst try to communicate

162
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,500
with your other the wider teams or vice

163
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,190
versa

164
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,810
let's not have that us have more of this

165
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,330
okay so I'm Matt Haines I work for Sky

166
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:24,900
Blu

167
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,760
I have roughly about 15 years of IT

168
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,990
experience I started from the ground

169
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,390
picking up a call I was and reset

170
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,940
passwords going right through to working

171
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,760
in the CTO department for a government

172
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,650
body if you want to follow me I'm always

173
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,510
ranting on mr. MD Haines

174
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,450
and I didn't actually say

175
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,950
during this presentation I'm happy for

176
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,690
pictures to be taken there's a couple of

177
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,240
models coming up and and other bits so

178
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,540
quite have to have photos taken so

179
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,640
intelligence what is it we got our raw

180
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,480
data like could be our network traffic

181
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,950
it could be just packets on that what

182
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,660
we're sniffing what we need to do with

183
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,190
that is we need to actually parse it and

184
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,280
understand it and process it once we've

185
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,990
processed it we actually then have

186
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,250
information we can then start

187
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,320
understanding what's going on and the

188
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,910
information element is kind of when you

189
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,880
start seeing it in newspapers we need to

190
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,230
take that and when you start analyzing

191
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,720
it we just start asking ourselves or so

192
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,490
what why is that applicable to me what

193
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,130
does that actually mean and the best way

194
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,520
I can describe intelligence is imagine

195
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,070
you have a puzzle you don't have all the

196
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,930
pieces of the puzzle we start to put

197
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,310
them out you can already start to

198
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,810
hypothesize and what that picture might

199
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,610
be maybe it's a picture of London maybe

200
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,450
it's a Red Bus

201
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,250
you don't need all the pieces to say

202
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,720
well clearly that's going to be a bus

203
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,490
and you can have a degree of likeliness

204
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,230
on how many pieces you have this is the

205
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,230
intelligent life cycle you start with

206
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,390
the direction so maybe the boss the

207
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,140
manager the general whoever is basically

208
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,880
said I want you to do something crack on

209
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,280
something as high as defend the

210
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,170
organization is a bit too fluffy it

211
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,850
doesn't really help constrain your

212
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,670
investigation but something like tell me

213
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,100
about eMeter how is that a threat to me

214
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,260
you can start to drill down into that so

215
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,340
the first thing you do with that is you

216
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,810
go and get all the articles you go and

217
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,730
understand what Emmet has been up to

218
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,800
you're going read papers from other

219
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,380
people maybe get a piece of malware on

220
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,570
your analyzer or send it to your reverse

221
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,160
engineers and they understand it and

222
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,590
they supply you with some information

223
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,120
and once you've got all that when you to

224
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,970
analyze it so what we want to do is look

225
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,440
at the evolution we might look at

226
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,020
previous campaigns previous waves and

227
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,190
think okay that's what they were doing

228
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,600
the past that's what they're doing now

229
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,850
so where they likely to be in the future

230
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,919
but once you've done that once you've

231
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,690
analyzed at all great you've got some

232
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,430
intelligence it doesn't do anything

233
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,590
until you tell it to someone that's when

234
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,390
you've got disseminate it so a lot of

235
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,090
the time we generally get that is papers

236
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,220
I know one Germany has that much time

237
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,649
to read a 30-page document what

238
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,449
sometimes you have alternative avenues

239
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:02,930
to disseminate that intelligence so it

240
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,560
might be a case of an audio file it

241
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,769
might be a funky diagram it also could

242
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:11,600
be just walking over to your sock and

243
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,459
just saying we've had this intelligence

244
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:16,970
and it could be a one-liner once you've

245
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,529
fed that into your your your wider team

246
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,029
they have a better understanding they

247
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:21,829
start to narrow and you'll continue to

248
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:28,850
iterate through so the intelligence

249
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,439
journey breaking down three areas

250
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:33,100
operational tactical and strategic

251
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,060
operational intelligence the way I see

252
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,139
it is generally your day to day

253
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,759
activities something has just happened

254
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,170
in the news something that's just

255
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,480
occurred from some organization you then

256
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,310
need to analyze it and go okay how is

257
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,800
that applicable to me and how do I feed

258
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,480
that into the general day-to-day

259
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,750
activities and keep processing it

260
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,829
tactical something just gone bang I

261
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:53,329
didn't really think people take this as

262
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:57,319
the IR situation instant response one of

263
00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:03,759
the big lessons or one of the big

264
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,959
exercises or qualification did you get

265
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,009
in in CTI

266
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:10,160
is sand four five seven eight they very

267
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,230
much focus on tactical but for my

268
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,420
experience and organizations none really

269
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,370
ever does that I do either operational

270
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,449
or maybe to a lesser extent strategic

271
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:21,379
and strategic is what you probably

272
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:25,459
envision it's the long-term view so what

273
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,660
you want to do there is you actually

274
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,459
have a good understanding of where the

275
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:29,990
threats are today maybe where they've in

276
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,459
the past but sort of looking in the

277
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:33,470
future and as far as you can with that

278
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,470
so when you're supplying strategic

279
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,899
intelligence maybe to the sea so and

280
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,819
above they need enough time to be able

281
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:42,410
to absorb and read that and react upon

282
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,000
it so we're not talking generally a

283
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
month or so we're talking months and

284
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,790
months or it's not over a year as an

285
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,050
example if you think about it if I said

286
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,740
to a C's oh we've seen this these guys

287
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,269
knocking off front door we're but defend

288
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:57,709
against them at a moment we like current

289
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,300
controls however they know they're not

290
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,730
winning so they're going to evolve and

291
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,800
if they evolve what do they have to do

292
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,600
to get around our defenses they know

293
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,060
this we can work this out

294
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,250
so they can use this type of probable

295
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,280
attack in the future so the CT so the

296
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,410
CCC so you has to get that understanding

297
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,900
absorbed that Intel and then react upon

298
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,730
it they might skim across budget wait

299
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,400
for the budget get sign-off pass it to

300
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,050
the program manager a project manager

301
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,870
architect who then designs sends off the

302
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,700
procurement gets the kit wait for that

303
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,740
to come in get it built get it configure

304
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,450
go through change control get it

305
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,920
operational that could take in large

306
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,660
organization six months eighteen months

307
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,590
quite easily so talk about couple of

308
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,360
methodologies so we talked about the

309
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,400
intelligence lifecycle principles and

310
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,830
controls when we're producing

311
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,230
intelligence we want to utilize these

312
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,000
principles now this can sometimes vary

313
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,740
and where you've been schooled in an

314
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,630
Intel compute

315
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,800
there's no point providing a

316
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,570
intelligence report that's kind of

317
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,180
half-finished it needs to be accurate

318
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,190
it's really really easy to lose

319
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,780
confidence if something is slightly

320
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,190
wrong and it takes a long time to build

321
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,930
up that confidence especially from an

322
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,660
Intel perspective and timeliness so if

323
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,250
it mentioned that from a strategic point

324
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,410
even if you gave a report to a C so

325
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,240
about a new control and you gave them

326
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,230
two months it might not be enough time

327
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,240
objective so don't let it be by us try

328
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,820
to actually include other people in your

329
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,570
wider team and just say you know am I am

330
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,810
I actually being biased on this is this

331
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,460
a few actually realistic and trying to

332
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,400
other views usable give it to people who

333
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,930
can actually do something with it so

334
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,970
that strategic report no point giving it

335
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,890
to your sock guys because they yes you

336
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,300
need to know about what's happening

337
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,610
today and tomorrow but then you don't

338
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,500
want to go give a yar overall to your

339
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,610
seaso because they're not going thing

340
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,670
with it and in relevance no point

341
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,530
talking about a particular technology or

342
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,210
a threat to a technology when you don't

343
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,740
run that technology so just think about

344
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,780
the relevance and of course with the

345
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,940
when the actual produced of the content

346
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,520
needs to be clear if you relevant this

347
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,710
be utilized brevity so to get straight

348
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,030
to the point

349
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,400
I think about security so if you're

350
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
writing something of intense purely or

351
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,750
something so clearly that's going to be

352
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,700
something of interest to you do you want

353
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,920
the attacker to know that that you're

354
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,440
interested in that and in ease of

355
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,240
assimilation so that's the dissemination

356
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,560
part

357
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,150
a large document might not always be the

358
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,740
easiest way to disseminate so the

359
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,540
probability yardstick and the words

360
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,850
estimated probability this is basically

361
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,680
how we sort of communicate that

362
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,430
likeliness it's pretty can you read that

363
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,339
on the back Kwasi yeah I don't need to

364
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,470
explain that I think that's pretty much

365
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,339
self-evident so when you get hold of a

366
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:45,050
written tell report when you read it

367
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,000
just be mindful that when they use words

368
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,980
and terminology is that's part of their

369
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,750
assessment so when they say something's

370
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,279
going to happen then like it's a is

371
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:56,480
likely probable etc and then there's a

372
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,400
NATO grading or the Admiralty code

373
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,980
system so when you read social media

374
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,130
tweets or something online hopefully the

375
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,620
majority of Isis ago well that's yes or

376
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,690
no maybe that's kind of right and that's

377
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,490
how we grow our sources do many more of

378
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,029
human activity so for example Shipman

379
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:15,710
walks in tells me something's just

380
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,910
happen around the corner I don't know

381
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,740
this guy I have no idea who he guess our

382
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,230
grade him as an f6 if Donald Trump said

383
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,000
that he could have gone by the NHS I

384
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,270
would probably grade him maybe a d3

385
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:37,760
maybe a one alright

386
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,020
so cuz you've got a nice little group

387
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,920
I'll actually make it a little more

388
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,490
interactive who kind of a one's hand up

389
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,500
a second everyone put a hand up a second

390
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,230
cool right put your hand down if they

391
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,260
know what awesome is if you don't know

392
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,890
what is

393
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,180
okay complete hands down now right

394
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,839
Sigyn who knows my second is someone

395
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,630
shout out cool go some scaly backs in

396
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,800
the room human human intelligence yeah

397
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,820
document who do you know what that one

398
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,280
is

399
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,589
no social media yeah absolutely so it's

400
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:15,140
kind of a sub under awesome maybe maybe

401
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,610
not I don't know if I agree I'd say it's

402
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,490
more closed-source taken people don't

403
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,380
know this one so technical or

404
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,510
intelligence let's say maybe you're

405
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,200
maybe in Israeli or US body and you want

406
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,230
to know how a nuclear reactor works or

407
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,720
centrifuge that's taken yeah do you know

408
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,630
how something works

409
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,340
pyaare or ir s-- anyone no realize

410
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,360
[Music]

411
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,650
awesome yep so that's kind of like what

412
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,060
Emily what the commander wants to know

413
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,730
what the boss wants to know that's

414
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,880
that's crucial okay as an intelligence

415
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,470
operators you need to know what the boss

416
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,600
wants to know it's really going to tell

417
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,830
you but if it doesn't tell you all she

418
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,570
might tell you are you gonna work it out

419
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,040
and the last thing you wanna do is going

420
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,390
to tell the attack of it because if the

421
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,070
attacker knows that they might go oh

422
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,600
that's interesting or maybe focus on

423
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,190
that or maybe they'll start sending red

424
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,160
herrings to to cause problems with that

425
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,060
ml's coa MDC la yeah absolutely yeah

426
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,800
most likely most dangerous course of

427
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,949
action well what does that mean so

428
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,400
absolutely yeah so who can think of some

429
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,290
normal organizations what might be the

430
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,090
most likely course of action from a

431
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,020
threat yeah I completely agree with you

432
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,640
phishing is probably one of them and

433
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:43,900
then most dangerous or deadly yeah yeah

434
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,760
so and I pass I mean it depends on the

435
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,080
organization it might be different to

436
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,360
where you where you work the personnel

437
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,950
say phishing most likely most dangerous

438
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,500
putting insiders what I would go with

439
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,620
Styx

440
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,210
you think that's a lot just put it in

441
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,180
there it's just basically a format that

442
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,610
they utilize for sharing information

443
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,520
intelligence and then IPB intelligence

444
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,589
preparation of the battlefield I've only

445
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,060
really seen that in the military space I

446
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,160
kind of do that when I go into an

447
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,720
organization I want to know what the

448
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,369
attack surface is what technologies they

449
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,319
have understand where we currently lay

450
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,720
or lay the land in the military space

451
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,740
what you do is you'd have a map of the

452
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,540
ground and then you actually line them

453
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,950
up where the rivers are and whether you

454
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,480
can actually talk move things and where

455
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,880
the tanks are etc can't the same thing

456
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,420
but from the cyber domain it's great

457
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,410
work who's it for

458
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,550
once again we're doing all this type of

459
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,230
activity we're not the benefits are but

460
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,730
who is it for everyone quite frankly so

461
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,950
it's you empowering decision-makers

462
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,630
that's what you're doing and the sock

463
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,580
are going to be responded to phishing

464
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,810
emails from the user they're going to be

465
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,450
reacting a comment alerts so for example

466
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,920
I've seen it before

467
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,280
if you know about ma tête I believe is

468
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
eMeter when it performs a c2 connection

469
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,530
it actually replies about the 404 now if

470
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,420
you don't know that you actually might

471
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,470
look at logs and go we've not been

472
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,420
affected because the server's in the ARP

473
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,820
and we're getting a 404 but in Tallaght

474
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,770
we don't know very well but actually is

475
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,990
what it does so you might want to tell

476
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,970
the male reverse engineer so you might

477
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,740
we'll tell the IR team about that so be

478
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,130
stuff instant responders absolutely need

479
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,570
to notice all way up through to see

480
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,430
those sees those need to know what's

481
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,170
going on because they need to actually

482
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,520
help the plan and prepare for the

483
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:29,380
controls okay so knowing the enemy and

484
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,060
know yourself I I personally feel that

485
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,220
threat intelligence is all about sort of

486
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,530
security research and understanding the

487
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,780
threat and that's why I absolutely do it

488
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,610
I actually love it so I'm learning from

489
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,200
the attackers as they evolve I try to

490
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,580
get to know them better than they know

491
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:48,340
themselves as an example we had a large

492
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,890
financial organization we kept seeing

493
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,540
these guys knocking on our front door

494
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,040
most of our controls were Germany

495
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,650
blocking them along that attack type

496
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:01,150
chain kill chain sorry but what we did

497
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,190
is we looked at them and what the

498
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,600
motives were and how they're evolving

499
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,610
what they're utilizing and they were

500
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,860
doing a lot of crime as a service and

501
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,360
then we started look at well who were

502
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,460
they using and how they evolving and

503
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,500
again then they know that are failing

504
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,600
they're not being successful so they go

505
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,980
talk to evolve they've got to utilize

506
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,310
new types of attacks so what we did is

507
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,960
we hypothesized and predicted

508
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,450
successfully two months of what I did

509
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,540
that start utilizing tor for C 2's so

510
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,160
they give us two months head notice or

511
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,900
start putting in new rules to detect

512
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,820
that type of activity and that's kind of

513
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,480
where this is all from knowing yourself

514
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,220
is another thing I don't know anyone who

515
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,420
matches a really good asset management

516
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,790
system but you're very much reliant on

517
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,290
your your wider teams your blue team's

518
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,750
your architects etc to have that you can

519
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,520
get that entire piece we're in a good

520
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,610
state so conscious about

521
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,470
I've rushed a little bit but there's

522
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,909
three things I'd like you guys to take

523
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:01,600
away from this the first is threat

524
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,130
intelligence is more than a food it

525
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,480
sounds though that the room that's kind

526
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,169
of not the issue which is great that

527
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:10,090
definitely seems to be an issue I've

528
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,440
noticed in the community where I've been

529
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,140
meeting people recently and that's been

530
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,149
very detrimental to the threat Intel

531
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:20,409
community they've received feeds they

532
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:21,700
haven't got good results they've been

533
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,049
responding to things that are completely

534
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:24,909
benign and they've been ignoring things

535
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:27,669
that may be a bit too specific so please

536
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:30,700
take that away the second thing is this

537
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,370
is not news so news is great but just

538
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,740
have an understanding news is the point

539
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,510
where you start from and they need to

540
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,309
hypothesize off that go why I was like

541
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:41,409
relevant to me why is that important

542
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:43,090
where do i evolved from that whether the

543
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,710
threat evolved from there and then the

544
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,320
third thing is empower others it's a

545
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,419
team sport it needs to empower the other

546
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:51,130
teams if it doesn't do that it kind of

547
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,100
fails in itself so that's the third and

548
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,659
final thing so generally expect better

549
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:02,380
yeah cool right okay I got link thank

550
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,710
you very much
