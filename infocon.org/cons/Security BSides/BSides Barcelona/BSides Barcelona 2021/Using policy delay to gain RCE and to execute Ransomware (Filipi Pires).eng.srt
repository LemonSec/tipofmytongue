let's talk about the using policy delay

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,000
to gain the remote code execution and to

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,480
execute the ransomware to in fact effect

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,680

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,760
introduce myself so i'm a priest

company from portugal responsible to

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,960
sell in a product from

contact center as a service and a

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
security research at singa segura it's a

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,600
global company from japan it's a

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,240
privilege access management solutions

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,240
in my fault there is to

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,479
to make a research actually not only

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,720
exactly in this way with this product

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,240
specifically but

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,079
to perform some uh researches in

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,400
different uh topics related to cyber

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,799
security i'm advocate of the hackiness

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,720
dollar crime it's an awesome project by

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,000
the way that we our idea is projected to

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,320
spread the message about the hacking uh

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,399
because hacking is uh how you can see

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,880
that the software's and how you can use

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
in your creative mind when you need to

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,640
perform something related to a

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,200
technology and by the way i will explain

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
about this uh

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,119
technique that i'm using this this task

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,360
is and how you can use in your

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,000
hacking mindset okay and i'm a part of

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,639
the coordinate team of this the defcon

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,318
groups here in sao paulo and by the way

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,480
i'm talking from brazil now in this

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
moment and i'm instructor of the hacker

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
security or hacker sec it's a brazilian

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,400
company and i have a course of the moral

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,800
analysis in portuguese language and i'm

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,200
a structure of this uh fantastic

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
magazine i have a course of more

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,120
analysis and more hunting actually and

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,680
i'm a writer and viewer in these three

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,920
magazines okay so just information about

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,879
me and before to talk about exactly the

68
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,239
test i would like just to putting all

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,920
those people in the same page so i would

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,800
like to talk more about the what is

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,599
exactly uh thread right so just a simple

72
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,800
definition

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
it's not not my definition it's

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,720
according this is just to explain more

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,480
what is exactly right so it's a

76
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,800
potential cause for an incident may

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,319
cause arms to the systems and

78
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,480
organizations okay i mean it's related

79
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
sometimes it's a software attack or a

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,720
theft of intellectual property or maybe

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,360
identity death or sabotage or

82
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,680
extortional information all those things

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
is related to a threat so why need to

84
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,360
understand about the threat fleet

85
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,800
because it's very important you

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,319
understand about the no threats and

87
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,680
unknown threats but you need to

88
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,480
understand about the how the non-threads

89
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,720
works because when you need to perform

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,800
some investigations about that or when

91
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,440
you need to uh perform some passes in

92
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,360
your environment you need to understand

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,519
the behavior about the threats right

94
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,120
because you don't know if it's malicious

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,799
or not if you have some sample for

96
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,959
example or some artifacts you need to

97
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,480
investigate more deeply you need to

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
execute some steps and after that you

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,280
can

100
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,519
understand if he's malicious or not okay

101
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,599
so this is the first step when you need

102
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,000
to perform something that when we talk

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,920
about the malware hunting or malware

104
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,760
analysis for example the identification

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,120
step is very important you need to

106
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,959
define it if is malicious or not or

107
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,120
malware malicious software or malware

108
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
malicious document and after that you

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,799
can define what the best methodology

110
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
that you can apply inside that right so

111
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,720
you define you you can using the

112
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
statistic analysis or the name cannons

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,319
right you have a different approaches

114
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,239
here maybe you are asking what is the

115
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,640
best way you can use both of them it

116
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,799
depends of course what the result you

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,840
need to

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,000
have in after this

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,478
this analysis okay and my

120
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,320
recommendations to you is always when

121
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
you have this when you need to perform

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,720
some tasks in this way you need to

123
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,960
prepare a report you need to you know

124
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,040
register that because you need when you

125
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
register that you can understand about

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,720
all those steps that you perform in

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,199
these tests and you have the you know

128
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,479
evidence of your analysis and why you

129
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,280
can do when you have this kind of

130
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
information you can improve your

131
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,120
defense's mechanism right and by the way

132
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
these tasks that i performed and i

133
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,479
represent you now during this

134
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,560
conversation i perform it in my

135
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
environment enough and after that i can

136
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,479
improve my defenses mechanism in that

137
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,479
time when i perform at these

138
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,520
tests okay and of course you can improve

139
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
your cyber threat intelligence

140
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,880
environment when you have if you don't

141
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,520
have you can create something you can

142
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,120
build it right in your environment

143
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,280
because the threats are changing all the

144
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,320
time so

145
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,759
you need to restrain it in the sub

146
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,560
resilience because again when you are

147
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
talking now during these presentations

148
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,160
or this during this conversation

149
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,320
probably someone are creating some new

150
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,919
attacks or even uh not only new attack

151
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,800
but creating a new uh variant of this

152
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,479
the same or the known attacks okay so

153
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,800
let me invite you to think on a

154
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
different way

155
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,400
so because of this i i i call change

156
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,160
your mind um

157
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,840
you probably you know what is exactly

158
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,080
cyber athletic hunting right so but my

159
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,639
idea is to explain more about this uh

160
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,479
different thoughts because when you talk

161
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,400
about the cyber the sub the threading

162
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,800
hunter specifically we are talking about

163
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,280
how you can see the logs in some tools

164
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,759
for example or if you have a soar right

165
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,639
or if you have a cm or if you have some

166
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,560
so if you're working in a secured

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,199
operation center uh you've seen many

168
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,120
logs and and of course it's pretty

169
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
important understand the logs and to see

170
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,840
the evidence but how the attacker thinks

171
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
that's my idea here because of this i i

172
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,759
call change your mind because when you

173
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,400
talk about the hunting you see about the

174
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,560
cyber defenses with the offensive mind

175
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
so how you can see the process

176
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,720
proactively interactively searching

177
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
through the network to detect and

178
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,840
isolate advanced uh threats remember

179
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,720
about that threat so how you can using

180
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,759
your uh offensive mind to work with a

181
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,160
defensive perspective this is my idea

182
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,240
here so what is exactly hunter the

183
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,960
people that worked with hunter if you

184
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,639
see in my social media for example i

185
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,199
like to use a lot more currency

186
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
it's not a normal it's not common this

187
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,680
word is in them when you talk about the

188
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,319
cyber security but how you can using the

189
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,199
hunting to uh you know to searching

190
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,039
something related to a cyber you know

191
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,599
cyber criminals or cyber attacks or

192
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,479
something like that and because of this

193
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,720
i i i would like to invite you to think

194
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
in a different way right so the trading

195
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,919
hunter is a qualified security

196
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,960
professional to recognize so here here's

197
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
a good point to recognize something

198
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,680
the this professional needs to

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,800
understand about the known threads works

200
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,440
so how exactly is the behavior of the

201
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,720
specifically

202
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,160
binary that you are analyzing right and

203
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,759
what kind of dll this binary have not

204
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,319
only have but what kind of function this

205
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,800
dll is imported by this

206
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,280
or this function is imported by this dll

207
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,199
so how this works in environment for

208
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,039
example if you find some

209
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,560
function called slip inside of this

210
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,400
binary so probably

211
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,960
this functions is important uh from the

212
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,919
same dll inside of this this binary and

213
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,319
probably this function is responsible to

214
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
using or to executing some techniques

215
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,440
inside of the environment that this

216
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,080
mower is executed this technical this

217
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,440
sleepy technique is more when the mower

218
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,720
uh are

219
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,039
being executed in some ascend box it's

220
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,840
another concept that you can using to

221
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
analyze the behavior of the moderating

222
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,919
controller environment right so how you

223
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,080
can recognize that so because of this is

224
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,560
important you understand the behavior in

225
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
a practical way okay

226
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,240
the second characteristic is it's it's

227
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,560
about isolate so how you can isolate

228
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,960
this thread to investigate and to see

229
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,199
more deeply and of course the main topic

230
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,520
is disable the potentials apt it's

231
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,320
economy of the advanced persistent

232
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,479
threat because it's more advanced and of

233
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,120
course it have many others different

234
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,719
techniques and characteristics of these

235
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,958
apts the groups involved and this kind

236
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,120
of attack okay so how we can use in the

237
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,760
manual or

238
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,000
artificial intelligence techniques to

239
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,560
to disable not only disabled but isolate

240
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,160
or recognize this kind of techniques

241
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,920
okay and this professional is

242
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,640
responsible to search some evidence in a

243
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,760
possible internal and external intruder

244
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
so here we have in another interesting

245
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,720
point

246
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,200
internal it means probably if you have

247
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
some issues suffering some attack they

248
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,080
have this kind of uh a pocket maybe can

249
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
be uh

250
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,399
stay inside of the organization inside

251
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,720
the network okay so it's important to

252
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
understand the behavior and to see what

253
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,640
exactly is the

254
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,200
place this attack are happening okay in

255
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,920
around your network right so let's talk

256
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,600
about this some techniques in using a

257
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
threading hand it's very famous about

258
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,080
the iocs and bit of compromise probably

259
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
you know about that so here's some

260
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
characteristics or indicators like a

261
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,959
suspicious and no hostile domain or ip

262
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,880
such pictures no hostile fire

263
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,519
cryptography but usually when we talk

264
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,959
about iocs is only related to and

265
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,839
attacking already happened so it's a

266
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,040
cause infections right and you can find

267
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,839
for

268
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,560
by signatures that actually suspect to

269
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,800
suspect um

270
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,120
infections or no hostile data such as

271
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
antivirals or ideas signatures

272
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,519
you can see more information about the

273
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,320
some datas or potential data related

274
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,880
some exploitations or some cve ideas

275
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,959
related to some exploiting using to

276
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,600
explore some vulnerabilities and you can

277
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,760
see more deeply and you can investigate

278
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
some indicators about the ttps the

279
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,200
famous statistics and techniques and

280
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,760
procedures associated with some

281
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,360
suspected and suspected or unknown

282
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,680
hostile events or maybe some behavior

283
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,600
different like for example an authorized

284
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,120
instance with a meaning

285
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,200
or for example if you don't have any uh

286
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,240
um

287
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,600
offensive team in your environment

288
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,440
executing seven is scanning in your

289
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,880
environment so it's probably totally

290
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,200
suspicious right but it's a good point

291
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
another tech not all another technique

292
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,320
but

293
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,800
you have in the market here the mower

294
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,720
information sharing platform it's a

295
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,360
platform responsible to consolidate many

296
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,320
different evidences of the events of the

297
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,480
attacks it's an open source platform

298
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,959
that you can see many evidences like you

299
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,560
can see here in this picture this

300
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,480
picture is from google so it's you don't

301
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,320
have any information from the customer

302
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,000
here so there are no words about that

303
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,399
but it's a good platform to see and to

304
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,440
consolidate more information about ioc's

305
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
remember when you talk about ioses is

306
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,079
evidence of the attack already happen

307
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,000
but how you can work with the proactive

308
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
way so here we can using another

309
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,320
different techniques based on eoa an

310
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,360
indicator of attack it's only be

311
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,320
based on the behavior and the why what

312
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
is exactly the intention of this attack

313
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,920
so this is a very important understand

314
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,720
that it's more a strategy view it's more

315
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,920
um mature view right so

316
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,480
it's more intelligence view when you use

317
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,640
it it's more a mature intelligence

318
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
program right so you can use it to see

319
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,279
the behavior and when you understand

320
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,279
about this behavior understand about the

321
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,360
unknown threads you can works you can

322
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,040
protect them

323
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,519
itself the your organization from the

324
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,639
new attacks or not only new but the no

325
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,480
known threat right so this is very

326
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,560
important so some indicators included

327
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,680
the real

328
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
time behavior not only limited on the

329
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,320
endy point behavior analysis like

330
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,040
for example if you see some

331
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,519
noise standard behavior for example at a

332
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,639
1 am right in your organization on your

333
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,880
company let's suppose that you have some

334
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,000
uh past ex from microsoft it's as part

335
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,839
of this is internals it's recruiting

336
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,279
some remote descripting in your

337
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,480
environment at 1am it's it's uh it's

338
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,320
it's it's not common if you don't have

339
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,760
any gpu to executing and in that time so

340
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,079
on this time probably suspicious because

341
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:42,959
why

342
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,279
remember the why so why

343
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,240
you are seeing in this log what are

344
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
happened this is scripting running at

345
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,639
1am in my organizations don't have it's

346
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,000
a total totally real time behavior right

347
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,480
and another point is what kind of dll so

348
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,959
now i'm talking about dll what kind of

349
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,160
uh

350
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,040
functions uh are imported from the dll

351
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,360
what exactly the sequence of the events

352
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,079
for example like the same example of the

353
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,399
pss act for example when you see the

354
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,800
logs when you see the behavior we can

355
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,240
see you can find for example um not only

356
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,320
1 a.m but 1 a.m 2 a.m 3 a.m 4 00 am

357
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,680
some descriptive running in your

358
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,560
environment but you don't have any uh

359
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,360
you know task in that in this time so

360
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,519
it's totally suspicious but you need to

361
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,360
think about that and you need to ask

362
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,320
why it happened in my environment okay

363
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,760
and user

364
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,160
behavior in relationship to the digital

365
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,120
threads like um

366
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,720
there's some

367
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,880
some user trying to connect

368
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,040
many times or trying to authenticate

369
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,199
different apps in a different time in

370
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,120
the same time but in different for

371
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,480
example uh

372
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,959
region so it's uh why it happened

373
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,440
because we're just only one user right

374
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,320
and

375
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,240
how it happened so maybe they have

376
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,839
different access or they have some

377
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,720
platform integrated with the systems but

378
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,120
why you need to do we need to make a

379
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,160
questions okay and and another point is

380
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,639
about the ttps techniques uh

381
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,399
techniques and procedures

382
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,480
such using this kind of technique and

383
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,560
this is another point so philip i don't

384
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,800
know what is exactly ttp so how this

385
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,720
works so you need to understand about

386
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,079
that you need to

387
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:26,959
you know

388
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,639
study more i need to

389
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,920
gain the acknowledgement you need for

390
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,160
example uh read more about the my tree

391
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
about the techniques in using some

392
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,399
attacks so you need to to find these

393
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,000
informations when you have this

394
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,880
information you can see the logs you can

395
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,360
see the binary and you can create the

396
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,480
the hypothesis and when you see that

397
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,360
you can

398
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,959
of course asking yourself about why this

399
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,199
happened in my environment okay and

400
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,279
another point is uh

401
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,959
something happened in my my environment

402
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,920
it is as persistent and stealth with

403
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,839
stealth components so it's a totally

404
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,480
using with attack so why it happened in

405
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,240
my environment if you don't have any for

406
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,320
example applications running some

407
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,240
because sometimes we have some like a

408
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,680
false positive in our environment

409
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,440
because they have some uh persistent

410
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
components depends on of course depends

411
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,279
of the applications but sometimes we

412
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,959
have so

413
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,480
we need to understand about that and you

414
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
need to think about the questions why

415
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,120
okay here's something like a suggestion

416
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,720
to you about the same indicators on

417
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,959
internal goals with the bad destinations

418
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,959
why it happened because for example

419
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,040
let's suppose that you don't have any uh

420
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,360
business with brazil that supports that

421
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,839
so why you have some internal hosts to

422
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,680
try to connect with brazil if you don't

423
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,880
have any kind of business with brazil or

424
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,199
internal hosts with a non-standard port

425
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,560
very common in many companies so what

426
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,880
you have some applications works in a

427
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,519
different known standard port right so

428
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,320
or many times many times to have or

429
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,639
sometimes actually we have a public

430
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,759
services or dmz to try to connect with

431
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,839
internal walls if you don't have any

432
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,120
applications within in this way okay and

433
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,519
another point is off of our mower

434
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,440
detection like i mentioned during our

435
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,040
conversation for example um at 1am when

436
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,759
the same time

437
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,839
something tried to happen in my

438
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,079
environment trying to infected my

439
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,040
environment but i have the block the the

440
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,720
block from the antivirus for example i

441
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,800
have the some solutions block this

442
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,959
tentative but

443
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,519
why this happen always the same time so

444
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,920
i need to investigate more because

445
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,320
remember the threads are changing all

446
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,560
the time so for example for now i can

447
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,880
block it but if this attacker changing

448
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,839
the techniques maybe it will be blocked

449
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,320
or not blocked so

450
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
remember about the questions why okay

451
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,399
networks this network scanned by

452
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,079
internal halls

453
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,440
let's suppose you don't have any

454
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,920
offensive team so why

455
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,320
multiple alarms events from a single

456
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,040
host it's very interesting here because

457
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,880
for example different

458
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,079
infections right from the single holes

459
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,760
why it happened or me or or even the the

460
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,280
systems is reinfected with the mower so

461
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,000
why this we have in my environment this

462
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,280
host or this system with a target right

463
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,160
so has a target why i have this so all

464
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,240
those indicators is based on the

465
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,640
threading hunting or eoa indicator of

466
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,000
attack remember based on behavior okay

467
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,919
multiples logging from different regions

468
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,080
if you are just one user maybe it's

469
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,000
impossible to write you stay in the same

470
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,320
place in different in different places

471
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,720
the same time right and internal host

472
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,799
using matches smtp

473
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,880
protocol if you you know if you have

474
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,799
just some environment inside of your

475
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,960
comp organization and you have internal

476
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,760
hosts to try uh connect with a different

477
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,000
smtp okay

478
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
internal host with the many queries to

479
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,120
internal and external dns when you have

480
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,200
of course the environment with internal

481
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,679
dns okay so

482
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,840
i i try to explain more about this

483
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,160
concept to you because it's very

484
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,039
important you understand how i

485
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,520
performed this test that i would like to

486
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,360
present even during this conversation

487
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,440
it's just to first of all it's a part of

488
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,120
a theory

489
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
you know

490
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,640
idea and now i would like to explain

491
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,720
more about the tests okay so first of

492
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,480
all this is just a responsible

493
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,240
disclosure for cyber reason company and

494
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,160
by the way uh all those tests are

495
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,240
reported to the company i talked with

496
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,480
the managers i talked on by the way with

497
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,160
the cso uh and sam sam curry i would

498
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,400
like to say thank you for sam because

499
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,559
they was they they

500
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,600
he uh talked a lot with me that we have

501
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,400
many

502
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,280
meetings and and i can help the solution

503
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,160
to improve the some

504
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,640
information after this the stasis that i

505
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,960
perform in my previous job not in this

506
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,640
this company that i have been working

507
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,799
now but in my previous job and i will

508
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,799
explain more during this presentation

509
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,400
but i would like to say thank you to the

510
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,960
cyber region team and this participation

511
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,880
and this uh returning actually uh from

512
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,360
the my reports because i performed this

513
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,400
and the same task in different vendors

514
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,440
but

515
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,280
the answer is totally different because

516
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,480
of this i would like to say thank you

517
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,799
for some reason okay so let me explain

518
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,559
more about the article presentation i'll

519
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,000
be using my

520
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,799
article here to explain all those steps

521
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,960
here right so this is the inspection

522
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,360
with the brands we're using the laypolis

523
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,320
um

524
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
actually i would like to explain more

525
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,640
about this first because i i have this

526
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,240
in two different

527
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,960
uh

528
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,200
articles here right and i will present

529
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,679
you some informations about this can you

530
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,600
see i think you can see my page here

531
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,440
right and um let me uh explain more

532
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,200
about that by the way all those

533
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,400
informations are here in my

534
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
in my github right so you can see my

535
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,000
github philip 86 slash strategy hunting

536
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
you can find it here all those tests

537
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
that i have been executing right so you

538
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,039
can see here the cyber reason all those

539
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,280
tests that i perform in here you can see

540
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,440
you can read if you want if you don't

541
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
want no words about that we continue to

542
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,000
be a friend okay but here you can find

543
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,480
many others articles that have been

544
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,960
worked right so let me explain about the

545
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,679
idea behind all this um tests that have

546
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,600
been executed in these different um

547
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,080
vendors okay so first of all the idea is

548
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,240
to perform let me explain more about

549
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,400
this first id so

550
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,559
the idea of this test is a simulate of

551
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,840
the some uh

552
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,200
target attacks is using some uh evasion

553
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,080
it was invasion techniques like a dellal

554
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,559
injections using a payload created by

555
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,080
msf venom very common uh in the in the

556
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,480
unix platform based on the on the kali

557
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,640
linux or perot os right

558
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,679
and

559
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,039
another

560
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,360
it's using some power shell to try to

561
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,440
explore some uh apis or using some apis

562
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
in this um

563
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,919
on this test right the second test is

564
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,640
using shell injection right to using

565
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,960
some the same or the same payload using

566
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,240
msf panel right so uh just creating a

567
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,480
reverse shell in this environment and

568
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,039
the third test i will

569
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,440
using another tool to execute the dll

570
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,520
injection the coldness of this did this

571
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,640
to its remote the dll injector right so

572
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,600
from security exploited

573
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,520
just uh using different tools to

574
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,120
executing the same

575
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,080
um

576
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,880
test right so here is the scope of the

577
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
test let me return here

578
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,520
this is the scope this is the version of

579
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,080
the the test that i'm executing and i

580
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,240
use executing this in two different

581
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
machines and the windows 7 and the

582
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,559
windows 10 so maybe you are asking why

583
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,559
you as it could flip in a windows 7

584
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,480
because we have nowadays many companies

585
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,360
with in those seven and by the way this

586
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,320
version it is um

587
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,280
supported by the vendor okay by the

588
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,000
cyber reason right so this is the my the

589
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,320
host name trendy hunting windows seven

590
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,600
and i i have another uh with uh try the

591
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,159
not ready but another windows with uh

592
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,640
windows 7 operational system okay so i

593
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,080
performed these two tests and then two

594
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,120
different

595
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,840
machines so this is the first uh they

596
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,080
need um some requirement actually uh

597
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,559
to perform i need to uh update some

598
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,200
requirements to executing the windows 7

599
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,679
specifically so i update the version

600
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,720
here just to be clear right during this

601
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
task as i installed this

602
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,280
update sometimes the the words just in

603
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,960
portuguese because i was whenever

604
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,799
performing these passes in portuguese

605
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,640
system operations right but i can

606
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,880
translate to you this is the update of

607
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,919
the security from indo this is the kb of

608
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,720
the microsoft basically this kb okay

609
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,679
this is to be supported from the vendor

610
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,320
and all those things is updated that

611
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,799
machine is updated okay so this is the

612
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,440
attacking validations first of all i

613
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,280
enable all those ops sorry for that i

614
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,720
enable

615
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,440
let me return here i enable all those

616
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,320
features like antiviral anti-ransomware

617
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,600
anti-malware powershell and.net exploit

618
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,840
protections collecting pictures app

619
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,400
control and any point controls i enable

620
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,360
all those three features and these cyber

621
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,320
reason manager okay so

622
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,120
that's my idea here what happened how i

623
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,880
can uh uh

624
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,360
execute the attack so first of all i

625
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,679
enable the the policies as you can see

626
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,400
here and after that my idea is to

627
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,279
executing the attack but i needed to

628
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,679
disable the policy to see if my

629
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,679
attacking happened uh

630
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,080
in the in a good way right it's my code

631
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,000
it happened so first of all i disable

632
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,080
the policies to execute this attack it

633
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,000
will happen and after that i will apply

634
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,480
the policies and execute the same attack

635
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,600
to understand if the policy uh it works

636
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,080
well and they protect the environment

637
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,400
okay so this is my my point here so

638
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,200
first of all i disable as you can see

639
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,799
here i creating a new policy that i

640
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,600
called here policy used by zoop secret

641
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,039
labs and i i call no police i mean i

642
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,600
disabled all those policies and after

643
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,720
that i using the first test performed i

644
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,799
using this simple uh function from

645
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,880
powershell to call this um invoke dll

646
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,480
injection dot

647
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,799
power shell here to try

648
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,679
using the dll injection to infect that

649
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,320
same process process id here and that

650
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
will using the process from the cyber

651
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,640
reason to infect that the machine using

652
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,200
the dll injection this is a very common

653
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,440
or known techniques right so this is my

654
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,880
idea here so as i could hear the

655
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,480
the power shell right so i call the

656
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,400
the binary from the internet as you can

657
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,679
see here right and after that i invoke

658
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,320
the solutions as you can see here

659
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,840
choosing this process id

660
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,159
5032 right and i sat here by the way the

661
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,279
the dll that i am using my attack and

662
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,799
after that i will inject the malicious

663
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,279
powershell here so as you can see here

664
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,679
it's it's easier so i chose here this

665
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,400
process uh 46 let me

666
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,799
4604

667
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,480
minion

668
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,640
it's not a fun name but it's minion host

669
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,480
it's a process from cyber reason by the

670
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,679
way and as you can see here i inject

671
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,799
my power shell and i invoke the dll

672
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,200
injection and i set here the process

673
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,600
that i you inject my powershell inside

674
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,799
of this dll and if you see here i called

675
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,919
the same

676
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:06,159
kernel.32.dll name i mean i i called the

677
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,840
same name with the the kernel 32 dll

678
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,640
using this uh

679
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,840
this um

680
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,760
process id right

681
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,400
because i will inject the dll injection

682
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,240
using these techniques in the cyber

683
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,080
reason process using the antivirus

684
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,279
process to infected the machine right so

685
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,679
just to to using in this in this way

686
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,960
okay so i execute this using this

687
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,240
malicious dll and after that let me show

688
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,200
you here

689
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,559
i

690
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,039
oops sorry for that let's return here

691
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:41,919
okay

692
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,240
i inject the attack here and the second

693
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,799
the next page is

694
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,279
okay and i open my machine here and i

695
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,400
open the

696
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,880
the netcat basically no netcat i'm using

697
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,240
a

698
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,039
metal exploit actually to open the shell

699
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,520
because inside of my script i have this

700
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,559
uh using how as i mentioned the

701
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,000
msfiveno and i open this port and i have

702
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,480
the remote reverse shell here as you can

703
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,640
see here the host name and i call the

704
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,960
name it's uh financial things in

705
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,720
portuguese financier right just to

706
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,640
you know suppose that i am a financial

707
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
guy okay so

708
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,279
the the process injection leads by this

709
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,559
msf venom created by me okay so have and

710
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,279
so now i have here the remote uh code

711
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,120
execution that i can manipulate this

712
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,200
environment as you can see here i have

713
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,840
the control of the victor machine using

714
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,159
the dll injection to inject my process

715
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,880
here and to using the process by the way

716
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,799
i using the process id from the cyber

717
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,720
reason right so just to be this is the

718
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,399
first test using here

719
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,320
this this is the second let me check

720
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,279
here okay the second step is

721
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,919
i mean my attack here it's happened okay

722
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,080
so i using the msf event to inject my

723
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,600
um shell inside of this dll injection

724
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,480
and are you using um

725
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
a messenger to create my binary and

726
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,880
after that i have the reverse shell

727
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,960
but remember i disable the policy so i

728
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,919
need to apply the points now here so i

729
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,399
after that i enable the policies and i

730
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,600
try to execute the same the same attack

731
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,520
as you can see here i enable the

732
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,279
policies using by

733
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,480
zoop security labs i mean i enable all

734
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,720
those policies as you can see here but

735
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,960
in this case now i call i call the

736
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,200
payload in a different way i called it

737
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,159
pa

738
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,919
dot dll it's not more um

739
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,360
can your doctor kernel 32.ll i using

740
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,320
another dll right pa doctll to gain the

741
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,559
remote code execution in our victim

742
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,960
machine so as you can see here this is

743
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,760
my

744
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,679
uh new attack but now with a policies

745
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,799
applied in this weakness machine okay so

746
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,480
let's continue to see

747
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,440
okay

748
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,399
let me go to the beginning here

749
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,440
the policy was enabled as you can see

750
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,480
here

751
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,640
okay

752
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,399
it's applied

753
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,360
but

754
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,640
as you can see here i gained the access

755
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,520
one more time so maybe you are asking

756
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,080
what happened philip the solution didn't

757
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,279
block it then blocking you and here is

758
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,080
the good point when i was

759
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,799
analyzing this uh

760
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,919
steps

761
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,520
i i

762
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,360
saw that we have a delay in this time to

763
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,600
the policies applied by the manager so

764
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,520
let me explain more how this works in a

765
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,679
security solution when you have some

766
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,240
solutions with antivirus for example and

767
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,720
you have the manager one in the one side

768
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,960
in another side you have an agent that

769
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,080
you need to install in your endpoint you

770
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,600
have a heart to beat

771
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,039
this is the communication with the

772
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,880
manager with the

773
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,720
binary side of the

774
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,880
entry point okay so you're having a hard

775
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,480
to beat some

776
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,559
sometimes not sometimes but if you have

777
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,039
the time with the communications between

778
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,240
the client

779
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,919
and the manager right so maybe the

780
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,320
manager can be inside of your network or

781
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,200
maybe

782
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,520
this manager can be in the cloud depends

783
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,360
of the solutions that you install in

784
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,520
your environment okay but you have the

785
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,039
hard to beat the timing of the

786
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,039
communications between the agent and the

787
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,760
manager right so when you have some

788
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,440
solutions

789
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,799
it's very important that they're saying

790
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,360
what is exactly the timing of these

791
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,039
heart beats so not only to receive some

792
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,200
new policies or new change or a new uh

793
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,039
for example um update of the the the for

794
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,240
example the

795
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,600
engines or new updates of the vaccine or

796
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,399
whatever

797
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,320
but you have the heart beat it's this

798
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,520
heartbeat can be in in for example in

799
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,000
one second or one minute two minutes

800
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,559
three minutes five minutes it depends of

801
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,039
the solution and i'm i'm

802
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,559
i'm

803
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,799
i when i is performing that i will

804
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,159
analyze what is exactly this delay and

805
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,120
when i know that when i saw this delay i

806
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,159
was

807
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,039
um

808
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,480
i thought

809
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,440
man i can exploit this delay so remember

810
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,640
when i explain about the hacking it's a

811
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,039
how you can look into this and software

812
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,640
and how you can use in your creative

813
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,399
mind so take a look at that so why or

814
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,399
how you can explore

815
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,519
the simple delay of the updates right

816
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,600
and this is one of this interesting

817
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,240
thing that i talk with the uh cyber

818
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,320
reason because when i talk with the

819
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,519
cyber reason the the cso talk to me and

820
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,399
and and pass me the the video and my

821
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,440
video

822
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,279
uh talk with me about the vision from

823
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,760
the cyberism he explained philippe if

824
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,279
the attacker the attacker perspective

825
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:00,399
explore explore my manager the attacker

826
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,440
didn't disable all those the attacker

827
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,919
will disable all those policies in the

828
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,039
environment

829
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,399
not only changing some policies and to

830
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,880
try explore the delay in my environment

831
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,519
if the attacker perspective the attacker

832
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,600
will disable all those policies and you

833
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,760
explore everything this is the vision

834
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,240
from the cyber reason and i agree in

835
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,720
part but i agree but i mentioned with

836
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,519
the cso in that case that

837
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,480
if i if you are i am attacker

838
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,320
i i i will

839
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,159
change in just some policies because you

840
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,559
know i would like to to as i put some

841
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,960
attack more silence right so if you see

842
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,399
uh how

843
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,559
how many times do you execute some

844
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,760
attacks in in more silence way

845
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
the change you have to be successful in

846
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,039
this attack

847
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,320
it's it's more it's higher right because

848
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,120
you will using in the silence attack but

849
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,360
if you like to

850
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,600
just to disable everything

851
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,360
when you when you

852
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,840
perform some attack maybe the the

853
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,559
organization has some sock team or some

854
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,799
you know blue team it's more easier to

855
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,279
see this kind of attacking happen but if

856
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,360
your attack is more silenced

857
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,120
the change to be suicidal it's it's

858
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,080
bigger right so because of this i are

859
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,559
are explained to the cso i can just

860
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,600
change the points because i know if i

861
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,279
found some delay

862
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,440
longer because take a look that

863
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,120
sometimes this delay it happened because

864
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,880
or if the solutions has the long time or

865
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,039
maybe because the internet connections

866
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,279
in some remote offices

867
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,000
is is not too too big right so they

868
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
don't have a good internet on internet

869
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,159
connections in this small offices so

870
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,799
sometimes if you have the connections

871
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,399
not to too good

872
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,159
you have this delay and this is the

873
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,760
opportunity from the other attacker

874
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,600
perspective to explore the victim

875
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,159
machine right so

876
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,600
when i

877
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
see about that i thought

878
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,440
man if i have this delay i can try to

879
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,960
execute some ransomware in this

880
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,480
environment so here is the another

881
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,040
article when i explore the same

882
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,960
vulnerability about the delay let me

883
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,839
explain here and i will execute here in

884
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,839
the same environment so first of all

885
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,079
using the same approach i disable

886
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,079
policies here as you can see

887
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,879
and after that i using this script to

888
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,480
infected with my machine so this is a

889
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,719
simple powershell as you can see here

890
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,480
you have just a uh

891
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,560
information that um the idea here is to

892
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,839
call using this api from our bazaar i

893
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,359
don't know if you know but more bazaar

894
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,599
it's a repository from the community

895
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,239
very that many uh

896
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,320
researchers uploaded many different

897
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,280
mowers there and by basically i call

898
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,480
this api

899
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,960
and i request this specifically hash

900
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,560
this hash it's from

901
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,440
wannacry by the way and uh here is the

902
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,000
exactly folder that i will upload right

903
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
in the victim machine but the point is

904
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,480
philip i don't know what is exactly the

905
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,440
path in the customer but remember if you

906
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,920
have the remote code execution

907
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,400
you can you can know about

908
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,800
about this path right you you can agree

909
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,960
with me you have the control you have

910
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,640
the path that you have inside of the

911
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,400
machine you probably you have about the

912
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,480
credentials of what kind of privilege

913
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,640
you have in this user that you explore

914
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,359
right and after that you call the api

915
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,520
probably but no problem but you need to

916
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,560
have this

917
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,240
api here from our bazaar in your uh

918
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,960
in your account okay and after that you

919
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,440
can automatically call the invoke web

920
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,920
request to execute something right to

921
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,520
download the zip zip file and after that

922
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,200
you can uh

923
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,640
extract this file they will call some

924
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,040
password you can set here the password

925
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,359
and after that you can call the evoke

926
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,839
expression to execute the mower inside

927
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,359
of the vehicle machine basically this is

928
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,680
the script in powershare right so we're

929
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,000
using the invoke web request and you're

930
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,560
using the vote expression so if you see

931
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,280
here is just a um

932
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,839
a function from powershell right it's a

933
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,200
true process in the windows environment

934
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,640
right so this is a simple script here uh

935
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,079
developed by

936
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,160
when my colleague and me and the in

937
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,480
jupiter innovation right so here is the

938
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,359
script so again this is cryptic call in

939
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,200
executing this behavior so let me

940
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,680
explain here so if you see here in this

941
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,680
uh results i call here

942
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,480
right this i call this powershell called

943
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
wannacry because it's hashi from

944
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,760
wannacry once once again and i download

945
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,920
here this is the request

946
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,480
by api from our bazaar remember that you

947
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,920
need to have the this key from mar bazar

948
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,520
to download this

949
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,760
specifically uh

950
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,800
okay and after that uh you need to to

951
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
have in your environment the zip file

952
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,839
just to

953
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,480
unzip this file and after that after you

954
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,800
extract this file you can execute itself

955
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,599
in the victor machine so after after i

956
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,680
execute this in with my machine the

957
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,920
victory machine it was in fact that

958
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,599
remember this test executing i was

959
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,079
executed in the um with the known

960
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,200
policies okay no no one policies enabled

961
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,680
in the windows set environment and

962
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,440
windows

963
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,599
in the windows 10 environment here let

964
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,640
me show you here windows 7 here and here

965
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,040
in the windows 10 machine so we have in

966
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,359
both system operations here and the

967
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,119
machine it was in fact that as you can

968
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,440
see here so now i need to apply the

969
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,240
policy okay so the second

970
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,040
point is i enable here the policies

971
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,599
using again remember the policy i enable

972
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,720
about the anti-malware's anti-hands-over

973
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,240
app control and all those configurations

974
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,040
here uh suggest and i'm not suggesting

975
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,520
but recommended by the vendor write

976
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,400
exploit protection powershell.net

977
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,560
all those protections so i've enabled

978
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,560
and after that

979
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,760
i executing the same uh attack as you

980
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,119
can see here the policy it is a naval i

981
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,599
think it's it's small but i will

982
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,920
it's enabled ready hunting

983
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,040
policies okay so here is the time that i

984
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,240
enable this point so the next step is to

985
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,280
execute the same attack right and let's

986
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,160
see here i as i could hear the same

987
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,400
attack but if you see here

988
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,880
using the same hash as i mentioned here

989
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,760
and take a look what happened it was in

990
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,440
fact that just only windows set machine

991
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,280
why i feel like it was happened just

992
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,560
only in windows 7 machining just

993
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,960
a simple uh case because the time let me

994
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,160
see here

995
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
uh do it to this delay the

996
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,839
synchronization between the server and

997
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,280
the sensor that's installed on the

998
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,520
vehicle machine during this four

999
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,839
minutes maybe more the machine will be

1000
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,200
vulnerable to any type of attack so as

1001
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,760
you can see here in the windows 7

1002
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,720
machine

1003
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,079
the environment it was infected because

1004
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,440
we have the delay to receive a new

1005
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,839
policy right and this is my point here

1006
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,800
windows 7 but when i execute this in the

1007
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,400
windows

1008
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,760
10 let's check here

1009
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,080
we have this some

1010
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,359
[Music]

1011
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,440
okay this let me check here and the

1012
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,880
windows 7 no assuming this is windows 10

1013
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,760
in the windows 10 we have the time with

1014
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,240
the seven minutes to receive a new

1015
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,520
policy so in this way the machine it was

1016
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,440
infected but if you see here take a look

1017
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,160
at this here in this case i use another

1018
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
different hash that the hashing is

1019
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
different it's not i want to cry here

1020
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,920
are using

1021
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,760
another hash

1022
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,920
there's another branch or patch as you

1023
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,240
can see here so if you see here this is

1024
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,440
the new log okay uh it's the execution

1025
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,480
the program doesn't works so i have some

1026
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,680
block it in this case i execute the

1027
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,760
another power shell as you can see here

1028
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,200
patchya dot

1029
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,480
ps1 it's a powershell but i called

1030
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,640
another um

1031
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,040
hash as if you see here i

1032
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,400
i still

1033
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,359
running

1034
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:23,920
not the execute demo i download here the

1035
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,240
zip file as you can see here

1036
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,520
i open the file i i unzip the file but

1037
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,160
when i try to execute the the binary i

1038
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,040
receive the block it by the cyber reason

1039
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,119
so why it happened because the update

1040
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,880
right of the windows 10 when you compare

1041
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,359
to windows server windows 7

1042
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,680
we have different time to update the new

1043
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,119
um

1044
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,359
the new uh policies of the date so

1045
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:52,720
that's my point here

1046
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,200
it depends of the system operation that

1047
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,520
you have in your environment it depends

1048
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,560
your

1049
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,640
office when you

1050
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,200
try to execute some updates you know and

1051
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,000
this is the point here so let me explain

1052
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,640
here here it's a good point when i i

1053
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,720
execute the same uh process in the

1054
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,960
windows 7 as you can see here but in

1055
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,400
windows 7

1056
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
it was in fact that but in the windows

1057
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,200
10

1058
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,000
it was a block when you compare the both

1059
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,319
of the system operations okay so let's

1060
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,520
see here

1061
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,520
it's here it's another test it's another

1062
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,480
test but it's for another uh talk and

1063
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,760
yes so here i finished my presentations

1064
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,200
right so here some books recommended by

1065
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,480
this kind of talk about the moral

1066
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,960
analysis and by the way i received this

1067
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,319
gift from the pack and it's pretty nice

1068
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,720
book i really recommend you because you

1069
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,560
can improve your knowledgement and more

1070
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,960
analysis and more hunting so how you can

1071
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,680
see more deeply uh any and you can

1072
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,560
create your own tests in your

1073
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,800
environment right so uh remember that

1074
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,680
just to clarify my idea here is not

1075
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
to tell you what the best solution that

1076
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,319
you can use if it's a reason trend micro

1077
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,520
or count striker or another one is just

1078
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,160
to give you this creative mind so how

1079
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,960
you can see the exact behavior of the

1080
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,079
binary non-binary the antivirus and how

1081
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,640
you can test it you can how can you can

1082
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,920
execute the efficient and detection test

1083
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,319
why i am telling you this because when

1084
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,880
you perform some pocs or

1085
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,839
proof of concept in your

1086
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,400
environment you know it's sometimes it

1087
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,640
is difficult to understand the solution

1088
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,839
it's really

1089
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,280
good to protect about the threats right

1090
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,960
because you need to

1091
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,880
desire receive some attack during the

1092
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,960
poc time it don't make sense for me

1093
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,119
right and because of this my suggestion

1094
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,680
you uh how you can create your own

1095
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,480
attack and you can try to explore your

1096
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,240
own environment right so if you have any

1097
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,640
question guys so i i'm here and again

1098
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,960
thank you so much the staff team for

1099
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,760
having me here and my contacts again on

1100
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,960
social media so if you have any question

1101
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,000
please let me know

1102
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,040
i can hear i can't hear you christian i

1103
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,640
don't know i don't know if you are ah

1104
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,040
yeah you always forget that i have a

1105
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,119
specific button on my microphone to mute

1106
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,640
as well so i have like double mutes to

1107
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,119
make sure that i'm using it

1108
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,960
uh anyway so thank you very much for

1109
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,160
your presentation that was quite

1110
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,839
interesting i i don't see any questions

1111
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,680
on the q a but i i do have one question

1112
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,880
about like

1113
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,200
uh so this was a specific cyber reason i

1114
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,359
was wondering if you

1115
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,160
did any type of testing on any other

1116
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,920
vendor products to see if they were kind

1117
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
of vulnerable they had the same

1118
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,480
vulnerability

1119
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,000
actually

1120
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,240
when i performed stuff this i perform

1121
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,680
this test is in a separate reason

1122
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,480
crowdstrike and so forth and actually is

1123
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,040
this is not a mainly test the melee test

1124
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,920
it is to understand how the engine works

1125
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,440
with uh no

1126
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,680
you know no mower so this is the first

1127
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,839
test the second test is to perform some

1128
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,720
uh uh actually to manipulate some more

1129
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,680
inside the environment this is the

1130
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,920
second test the the main test right so

1131
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,599
the first is download many gnome hours

1132
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,240
from the zoom repository from the github

1133
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,319
for example or minimum hours from our

1134
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,560
bazaar so this is the first the second

1135
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,160
is i will cop for example 20 to 20 hours

1136
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,599
in the

1137
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,680
folder and i will cop and pass in

1138
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,520
another folder because when you're

1139
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,480
performing this you are writing some new

1140
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,040
files inside that the hard disk so if

1141
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,640
you have some engines

1142
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,520
they need to to you know uh

1143
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,839
perform some scanning this new file and

1144
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,079
this is the second in the third test i

1145
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,400
will be executing the full scan in the

1146
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,560
machine to understand about this this

1147
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,319
behavior all those tests that i am

1148
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,200
performing its phone is always using my

1149
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,599
real hours right so this is the main

1150
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,240
test that i perform but in in some

1151
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,200
vendors i have i know i saw different

1152
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,760
behaviors about the aims so the the

1153
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,000
simple answer about the question it's

1154
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,839
about the delay time i just said

1155
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,160
performing the cyber reason because we

1156
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,240
had in that time this solution but my

1157
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,480
focus is more in the cyber reason but i

1158
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,680
have a

1159
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,760
a different surprise and in a so far

1160
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,480
than

1161
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,520
maybe not

1162
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,079
mainly encounter strike and by the way i

1163
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,079
have a talk about that so how we can

1164
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,560
explore using a power shell using a

1165
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,200
python script and how you do you know

1166
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,680
using all those informations are in my

1167
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,079
youtube you can see my information that

1168
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,160
about the tests in some classes i have

1169
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,560
the the demo by the way the video that i

1170
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,839
recorded and

1171
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:46,960
um but yes

1172
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,440
my suggestion from the audience is

1173
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,160
test is a cutting test in your security

1174
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,319
sensor because

1175
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,880
only this way you can exactly prove if

1176
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,040
this solution is efficient or not

1177
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,680
because when you don't execute this test

1178
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,240
the solution maybe can be protect you

1179
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,040
but

1180
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,440
you you just don't know if it

1181
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,200
works well if you're suffering some

1182
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,599
attack right so that's my point here

1183
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,359
yeah that's quite interesting and it

1184
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,000
also kind of reminds me on and it kind

1185
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,720
of

1186
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,720
uh the word that comes to my mind is

1187
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,960
methodology right it seems like you have

1188
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,040
like a methodology to try um different

1189
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,280
kind of edr products

1190
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,640
uh and i wonder like do do you have that

1191
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,520
published somewhere like uh

1192
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,800
like you know like you know like the

1193
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,640
pentest mental body is like okay you do

1194
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,480
reconnaissance you do this you do die

1195
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,839
you do that right it would be

1196
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,400
interesting to to know uh to read about

1197
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,720
like the methodology that you use like

1198
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,640
the basic things that you look for when

1199
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,440
you are evaluating one of these edr

1200
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,720
produce like

1201
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,800
first download the second like try to

1202
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,200
disable it re-enable it and put real

1203
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,440
model yeah different types of mobile uh

1204
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,720
anything like that do you have anything

1205
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,880
published uh around that

1206
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,520
uh yeah i have all those uh information

1207
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,160
that i published it is my web my webpage

1208
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,800
and the linkaging and uh

1209
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,720
about my evaluations in my about my

1210
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,960
tests our publishers are there

1211
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,119
and another interesting test that i'm

1212
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,480
executing is

1213
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,200
for example i don't i we haven't bazaar

1214
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,839
for example you can call by api the

1215
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,640
all those mowers uploaded during the day

1216
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,200
uh they all those models uploaded during

1217
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,200
for example the day the marbles are has

1218
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,599
a repository they

1219
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,599
when they put all those mowers there so

1220
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,800
for example

1221
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,800
probably let's suppose that you have in

1222
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,640
a in on wednesday

1223
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,280
more bazaar can receive for example 1

1224
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,079
000

1225
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,280
in this day

1226
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,520
right so it's a daily breaks called

1227
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,000
daily breaks so you can request this

1228
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,280
daily bread

1229
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,359
and you can download more than one

1230
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,760
thousand hours in your environment so

1231
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,440
you can simulate for example somehow to

1232
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,000
break infection in your environment as i

1233
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,680
i executed in with sofas for example

1234
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,559
and the

1235
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,960
answer is totally you know like i would

1236
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,680
like i will use this this word it's the

1237
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,880
answer it was right because the

1238
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,960
the the security solution tell me

1239
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,160
oh yes we we try to execute these tests

1240
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,720
and uh you know i mentioned you're the

1241
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,200
changing in my environment it's the cpu

1242
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,440
is too high the memory is too high

1243
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,280
because i'm you know how to break

1244
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,680
fashion and the cyber in that sofas tell

1245
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,640
me

1246
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,920
yes it's true we know that

1247
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,400
so you know that's the high cpu high

1248
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,920
memory so

1249
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,960
and

1250
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,119
if the engine is broke so what happened

1251
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,520
with the protection

1252
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,520
i didn't receive the answer about that

1253
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,319
right so that's my point here i'm and

1254
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,160
the answer again from the sophos it's

1255
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,960
and it's not exactly test that there's

1256
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,440
surface executing in our uh

1257
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,559
engine

1258
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,640
so nice but if i suffer it's a

1259
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,480
multi-break infections so how does your

1260
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,720
solution happen you didn't test that i

1261
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,280
know probably it's not como attack but

1262
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,280
now i know how i can broken the sofas

1263
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,599
right so you know the the

1264
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,440
the the mindset and um

1265
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,079
but unfortunately we in some security

1266
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,520
sensors we don't have this uh open uh to

1267
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,599
take open talks right right so open

1268
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,520
conversations to talk more about the

1269
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,520
some efficient detection tests

1270
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,520
and um

1271
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,000
i i think that's it's very important to

1272
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,359
open to conversation with the

1273
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,000
researchers with you know to understand

1274
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,760
because man

1275
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,520
some lab some you know some

1276
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,680
organizations like a gardener like you

1277
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,839
know uh

1278
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,280
forester pinger called it's you know

1279
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,839
it's a good reference of the the

1280
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,880
organizations with some uh

1281
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,160
you know information about the secret

1282
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,839
solutions recommendations but how

1283
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,079
exactly happened the tasks right it's a

1284
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,880
commercial password it's a detection

1285
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,640
attached with a real malware it's a real

1286
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,800
life right this is the point here in

1287
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,839
your

1288
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,279
in the end of the day right

1289
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,359
yeah yeah i feel like sometimes you get

1290
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,280
tests with malware that they of course

1291
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,880
know that they're going to detect right

1292
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,680
but when you throw something else you

1293
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,200
never know

1294
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,720
all right so we've got another question

1295
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,559
from the q a i'm going to read that for

1296
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,680
you is how did you manage to

1297
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,000
to do isolation on the virtual machine

1298
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,400
for malware analysis and still get

1299
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,760
updates from

1300
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,319
uh av i'm planning to get into my way

1301
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,839
analysis and thread hunting in the

1302
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,559
future and i'm wondering how to do that

1303
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,359
that was asked by terence

1304
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,839
yeah yeah good question so how did you

1305
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,160
manage to do installation of the vm

1306
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,240
firmware now this is a good point here

1307
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,520
because

1308
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,720
for example

1309
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,640
you when you have some virtual machine

1310
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,440
you can pass the mower but when you

1311
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,680
created this virtual machine

1312
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,480
you

1313
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,200
configure some networks and you you

1314
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,720
execute them out inside of the virtual

1315
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,760
machine but it's totally different

1316
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,480
and

1317
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,480
by the way it's a misconfiguration

1318
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,559
concept when you this when you tell not

1319
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,400
know in this case the the question but

1320
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,800
when some people tell about i you have

1321
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,400
the virtual machine and i have the

1322
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,880
sandbox there now it's not a sunbox

1323
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,280
virtual machine sandbox is that you have

1324
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,280
a virtual machine with many engines

1325
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,520
inside of that and these engines is

1326
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,079
responsible to understand the behavior

1327
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,319
of the mower right so this is the point

1328
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,960
here and when you can install of course

1329
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,200
the amount the antivirus inside of the

1330
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,599
virtual machine but you need to have the

1331
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,359
same scripting running inside of the

1332
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,599
virtual machine to understand all those

1333
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,520
behavior when you perform this monitor

1334
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,119
inside of this when you run the mower

1335
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,720
inside of the machine

1336
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,920
and off reports because nowadays we have

1337
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,000
many mowers using the sleep techniques

1338
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,760
as i mentioned during the conversation

1339
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,920
it's the simple uh functions important

1340
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,480
from dll from the microsoft by the way

1341
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,319
and you can import of this virtual

1342
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,880
machine in in sometimes because the

1343
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,960
mower will see the environment and the

1344
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,680
more one will think i am here in the

1345
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,280
virtual machine i can execute my

1346
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,240
malicious uh disturbs right so this is

1347
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,760
the point here

1348
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,680
and of course when you need to perform

1349
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,119
some analysis it's very important when

1350
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,520
you perform this in our isolate

1351
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,359
environment like a virto machine has

1352
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,280
mentioned but it suggests to clarify the

1353
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,760
concept when you talk about the

1354
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,480
sandbox and virtual machine right so and

1355
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,400
this is the first question right and

1356
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,400
another question is am i planning to get

1357
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,000
into more analysis prodigante in the

1358
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,599
future and i was wondering how to do

1359
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,160
that right so that's the point uh we

1360
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,680
need to understand these different

1361
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,920
behaviors right and and how you can

1362
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,119
investigate that in the sandbox concept

1363
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,040
and the virtual machine concept and by

1364
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,800
the way and in my github i have some um

1365
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,680
awesome our analysis and uh in awesome

1366
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,920
tradition if i remember correctly i for

1367
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,160
this awesome project just to

1368
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,079
to be easier to find some informations

1369
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,160
and you have there in the awesome our

1370
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,119
analysis many different uh in antivirus

1371
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,559
scanning and and sandbox uh using the

1372
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,800
cloud and you can perform some hours

1373
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,200
inside that and you can see the behavior

1374
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,079
all those techniques is based on the

1375
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,119
analysis

1376
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,359
dynamic analysis right because when you

1377
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:18,800
perform this modernization controlled

1378
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,200
environment and you see the behavior and

1379
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,800
runtime when you talk about the

1380
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,880
statistical analysis you analyze the

1381
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,280
malware in not a runtime it's usually

1382
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,760
it's more safe right because you see the

1383
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,319
the structure of the code how

1384
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,960
specifically dll called in the system

1385
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,520
operations but you don't execute

1386
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,640
sometimes

1387
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,839
in the environment

1388
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:44,240
right thank you for for answering that

1389
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,960
uh i would also like to to give

1390
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,119
someone a bit of answer to terence there

1391
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,920
about like the isolation that you

1392
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,480
usually have on on your virtual machine

1393
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,800
you configure your network and you put a

1394
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,800
firewall on front of your virtual

1395
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,680
machine so you can figure very tight

1396
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,839
rules that you only allow the virtual

1397
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,880
machine to talk to basically the service

1398
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,280
that you wanted to talk so you allow to

1399
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,760
talk with the ip addresses of where you

1400
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,720
av

1401
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,400
get the updates for instance but you

1402
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,319
don't allow it to talk to anywhere to

1403
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,040
anything else and that's the only uh

1404
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,359
traffic that your lives for instance so

1405
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,359
that's smallest yeah you know another

1406
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,960
point is when you talk about the virtual

1407
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,839
machine is uh sometimes we

1408
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,280
the analysts like to disable the network

1409
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,599
with the virtual machine right

1410
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:34,640
to

1411
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,440
just to see the behavior or you know not

1412
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,440
to spread the network or inside of the

1413
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,240
environment but sometimes the malware in

1414
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,000
your environment needs to have she needs

1415
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,079
to access the internet

1416
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,079
so because on this it's for example if

1417
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,160
he's a dropper for example properly it's

1418
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,640
not totally malicious because they may

1419
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,359
mainly strategic many functional

1420
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,000
structures many the main function of the

1421
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,559
dropper is download another malware so

1422
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,400
they need to access the internet to drop

1423
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,160
another model to download the model

1424
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,680
actually so

1425
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,960
and this is the point here

1426
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,599
all right thank you very much for for

1427
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,559
all the

1428
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,119
the answers there and for the talk uh it

1429
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,960
was a pleasure to have you here

1430
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,640
yeah thank you thank you everyone thank

1431
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,119
you again christian for for for having

1432
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,040
me here and i hope next year to be in

1433
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,040
person and by the way

1434
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,880
in january i will move to portugal i

1435
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,240
will i will be

1436
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,479
