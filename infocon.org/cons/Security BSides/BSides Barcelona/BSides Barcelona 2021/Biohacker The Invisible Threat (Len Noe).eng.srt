00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,279
so next type we have lenoire who is

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,400
joining us from texas the united states

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,730
good morning foreign

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,920
[Applause]

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,720
i'm very excited about this

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,000
uh this talk very curious about it so

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,119
yeah

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,359
you can take it from there

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,199
appreciate it thank you christian first

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,640
of all uh

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,480
just wanted to say thank you guys for

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,560
allowing me the opportunity to speak

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,800
this is going to be a really fun fun

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,719
talk today

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,880
my talk is called biohackers the

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,120
invisible threat

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,360
uh my name again is len know

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,160
i'm part of the cyber arc

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,039
uh

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,879
corporation i'm one of their global

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,320
solutions and part of their global

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,640
domain solutions enablement team i'm one

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,800
of cyberarks white hats

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,640
i'm also a global security speaker and

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,160
i've been with cyber art now for going

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,559
on eight and a half years

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,120
i've been in it professionally for over

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,040
26 years in roles ranging from

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,159
programmer to systems architects

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,000
i've been also breaking into computers

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,159
since the commodore 64 days and spent a

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,360
really large amount of my time in my

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,920
youth as a black or a grey hat hacker

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,759
i am professionally trained as well as

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,200
come by a lot of my knowledge through

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
practical application i'm really really

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,759
active on social media and i invite

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,840
everyone to reach out over linkedin and

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,759
check out my github and my youtube

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,320
channels for additional security related

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,759
content

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,640
so

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,280
let's get right into it

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,040
so i wanted to start today by asking a

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,520
very simple question what does a cyborg

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,280
look like

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,200
when you hear the word cyborg what comes

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,720
to mind maybe a terminator star wars you

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,640
know quick shout out to my the previous

50
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,280
speaker i'm all about the sarlacc pit

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,200
or star trek anybody who knows the

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,799
definition of a cyborg would probably

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,640
have some vision in their head and i'd

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,159
be willing to bet that it's all shiny

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,560
and to some extent robotic looking

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,840
well i hate to pop your bubble but

57
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,159
that's just not the case anymore guys

58
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,680
cyborgs are not only on the movie

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,840
screens they walk among us and you may

60
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,758
be friends with one and don't even know

61
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:10,560
it

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,319
these are my hands

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,319
i'm a biohacker in the truest sense of

64
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,319
the word i am not only an augmented

65
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,640
human with microchips in my hands but

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
i'm also a white hat hacker

67
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,879
i'm a hacker that has modified my body

68
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,319
to take advantage of the available

69
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,319
technologies to turn myself into the

70
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,680
attack vector

71
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,040
i'm going to explain what my current

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,280
chips are as well as giving you a road

73
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,800
map on what i'm looking to do to

74
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,840
continue my journey to become more than

75
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,920
human so as i said the x-rays above

76
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,120
these are my hands and i have the

77
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
following capabilities with my current

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,000
implants

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,480
i have a flex next this is a long range

80
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,599
nfc rfid reprogrammable chip

81
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
i have a next chip it's the same as the

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,959
flex next much smaller range

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,599
i have a flex m1 magic this chip allows

84
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,599
me to emulate any number of older access

85
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,920
cards from public transit to membership

86
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,400
tokens to physical access

87
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,879
i have a vivo vivoki spark2

88
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,800
this is a cryptobionic chip that can

89
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,680
perform strong cryptographic functions

90
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
and since the time this x-ray was taken

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,400
i actually have two additional implants

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,239
i have a flex em this allows me to

93
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,000
emulate most of the popular physical

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,319
access cards including prox

95
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,480
prox2

96
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,319
hid indala pyramid and just a ton more

97
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,360
and i also have a titan biomagnet this

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
is a biosensing magnet that's been

99
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,280
placed in my pinky and this allows me to

100
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,760
actually feel

101
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,920
electromagnetic currents

102
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
so augmented humans are not science

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,680
fiction we're here we're not going

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,920
anywhere and as the technology continues

105
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,040
to evolve

106
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,440
so will we

107
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
so i've broken this talk into three

108
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,400
parts

109
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
yesterday today and tomorrow

110
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,920
i'm not going to spend a lot of time on

111
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,080
the history of who we were just enough

112
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,319
to show that the biohacker or transhuman

113
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,360
is just the point where science

114
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,720
technology and humanity meet

115
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
so the idea behind implanting technology

116
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,400
inside the human body's been around

117
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,239
since the 1950s

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,599
the patent for the first cardiac

119
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,000
pacemaker was submitted in 1952 and was

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,640
the size of a table radio this was not

121
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,238
fully implantables

122
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,759
and actually required leads to be

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,000
connected to the external power source

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
with the advent of the transistor in the

125
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,759
night the mid-1950s the ability to

126
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,840
construct a fully implantable device was

127
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,639
achieved in may of 1958

128
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,240
the first implantable technology was

129
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
actually placed inside of a test subject

130
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,960
animal

131
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
the first human to receive an electrical

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
device implanted in the body was in

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,479
buffalo new york in 1960.

134
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,000
the tech up to this point was pretty

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,759
static and didn't allow for much in the

136
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,360
way of conditional executions or

137
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,720
modifications from the original

138
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,840
programming

139
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
1964 gave host the first implantable

140
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,320
technology that can take data

141
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,639
from the body itself

142
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,199
throughout the 70s and 80s

143
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,639
there were some advancements but nothing

144
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,080
that would really set the world on its

145
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,040
ear

146
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,280
1990 is when things really started to

147
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
pick up for the implant community

148
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
from the creation of smart devices all

149
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
the way through to

150
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,840
artificial intelligence

151
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,720
where that is now today commonplace for

152
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,800
biohackers our history was forged by the

153
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,000
medical profession to address

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,759
deficiencies of the human body from a

155
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,600
reactive perspective

156
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,199
by that i mean that the issues were

157
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,520
already there additionally there were no

158
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,840
options for an individual to enhance

159
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,199
themselves through technology

160
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,479
so

161
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,440
who are we today

162
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
people like myself are referred to by

163
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,840
many names biohacker grinder transhuman

164
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,360
regardless of what name you want to put

165
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,039
on us we all share the concept of moving

166
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,720
beyond the human form that we were born

167
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,840
into

168
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
the term transhuman

169
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,520
was actually first coined by julian

170
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,840
huxley in

171
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,600
the movement he created was fueled by

172
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,360
multiple people looking to extend the

173
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,880
capabilities of the human form

174
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,800
so where do you find implantable

175
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,160
technologies

176
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,520
the same place we find everything else

177
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,280
the internet

178
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,800
now there are multiple implant

179
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,960
manufacturers from to choose from i

180
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,479
personally work exclusively with

181
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,160
dangerousthings.com

182
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,639
i do not get a kickback from these guys

183
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,880
but i typically get asked where do you

184
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,639
get this type of stuff so i'm not trying

185
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,840
to you know advocate for these guys do

186
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,520
some research these are just the guys

187
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,120
that i use

188
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,080
you know these are just some of the

189
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,759
types of implantable technology that are

190
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,199
actually out there and available right

191
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,919
now we have magnets both lifting and

192
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,800
biosensing we have flexible

193
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,759
you know

194
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,120
uh nfc

195
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,240
we have

196
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
flexible

197
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,080
uh rfid we having clap encapsulated nfc

198
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,280
and rfid and encapsulated leds for those

199
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,479
that want to go out and have a really

200
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,240
fun night at the club

201
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,840
and there are multiple variants within

202
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,199
these categories

203
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,479
to address specific requirements

204
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,319
i'm not going to go into the procedure

205
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,160
on how we install the implants let's

206
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,240
just say there are needles or scalpels

207
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,360
involved

208
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
based on which implement uh which

209
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,880
implant that you want to actually have

210
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
done

211
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,599
and if you're interested in more

212
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,199
information about that please get with

213
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,280
me after the talk i would be happy to go

214
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,960
through it as deeply as your stomach can

215
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,240
handle

216
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,280
so

217
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,720
these devices were designed to make

218
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,800
people's lives easier we have the

219
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,319
ability to start our vehicles with

220
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,240
implants imagine never losing your keys

221
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,120
again

222
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,280
or how many people have fobs for access

223
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,479
to a gym

224
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,840
or a shared garage or a storage unit

225
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,199
what about being able to pay for goods

226
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,759
and services the same way that we use

227
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,800
with apple pay or the android wallet but

228
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,080
you never have to worry about forgetting

229
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,120
your phone

230
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
every one of these activities

231
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,639
constitutes a legitimate use case

232
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,400
unfortunately

233
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,440
not all of us are friendly

234
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,599
as security professionals we need to

235
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,720
start looking beyond what we're

236
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,800
comfortable with beyond the normal

237
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
attacks that we've heard about for years

238
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,960
the attacks in the end game may not have

239
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
changed but the delivery methods have

240
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,720
come right off the movie schemes and

241
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
into our company's infrastructures and

242
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,759
data centers

243
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,360
security admins know that the normal

244
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,759
attack vectors of usb drives phishing

245
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,479
cves the list can go on forever but how

246
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,919
do you address the fact that any one of

247
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,440
your employees could potentially have a

248
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,599
full linux distribution

249
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,039
to nfc or rfid chips beneath the skin

250
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,680
what if someone implanted an hid or a

251
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,520
proximity access chip there would be no

252
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,159
evidence or indications of compromise to

253
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,760
the naked eye for someone in a

254
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,279
restricted area for physical access

255
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,958
chip implants utilize the same

256
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,958
technologies that enterprises are using

257
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,480
rfid for door badging nfc for iot my

258
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,200
favorite hid proximity cards for

259
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,680
physical access and this is just a few

260
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,519
with the number of regulations and

261
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,360
audits that companies are required to do

262
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,440
for for compliance how would you know if

263
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,360
somebody's bypassed your security policy

264
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,800
and brought a rogue asset into your

265
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
environment the simple answer is you

266
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,240
wouldn't

267
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
the peg leg

268
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
is a single board computer that has been

269
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,519
modified to a minimalist form factor

270
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,040
with a wireless charging receiver and

271
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,440
then encased in biopolymer and implanted

272
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,640
in the body

273
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
this is on the outer edge of extreme

274
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,720
even for most biohackers this is not a

275
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,399
simple process and making sure that the

276
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,160
sbc is completely sealed has caused a

277
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,680
number of individuals

278
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,040
that have attempted this implant to

279
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,600
require emergency removal surgery

280
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
this still doesn't stop many more

281
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,959
including myself

282
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,080
from trying to get one of these things

283
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,200
implanted

284
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,440
these devices have a have wi-fi as well

285
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
as bluetooth capabilities and can be

286
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,240
accessed over ssh from a mobile device

287
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,680
this would allow a bad actor to have

288
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,600
access to binaries or even something as

289
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,240
widely known as responder

290
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
they can be made into rogue access

291
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,440
points as well as command and control

292
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,640
servers

293
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,160
the possibilities for a concealed linux

294
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,680
system are only limited by the

295
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,000
imagination of the attacker originally

296
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,680
intended to act as a logless file

297
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,440
transfer drop the peg leg was originally

298
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,120
designed to leverage the pirate box

299
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,399
software

300
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,399
however as with anything in technology

301
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
the technology space people took that

302
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
simple idea and had branched out into

303
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,880
even more creative or devious areas

304
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
based on your perspective

305
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,000
full linux distributions have been

306
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,200
implanted these devices are headless

307
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,959
like i said but do have access to that

308
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,959
wi-fi access point configured to allow

309
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,959
access to the implanted device

310
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,959
once connected the attacker has access

311
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,320
to the terminal for interactive

312
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,240
processes or can be set to perform

313
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,160
non-interactive scans and sweep for low

314
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
energy bluetooth that could be utilized

315
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,920
for an attack like blueborne or working

316
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,440
in conjunction with a usb share

317
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,519
application like virtual here an

318
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,120
attacker could execute mouse jacking

319
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,959
attacks and inject automated payloads

320
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,480
with tools like jacket

321
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,079
all while standing and having a casual

322
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,680
conversation

323
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,600
right there at your desk

324
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,519
the total number of peg leg implants is

325
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,839
really not widely known because this was

326
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,160
very much a computer a community based

327
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,200
project

328
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,399
however the fact that there's at least

329
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,079
one individual that has this ability

330
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,640
should be more than enough case

331
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,360
for security admins to take notice

332
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
let's take a moment just to think about

333
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,079
this

334
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,000
how as security professionals can we

335
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
regulate secure locations if people have

336
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,680
the ability to conceal full computers

337
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
within the body this becomes an even

338
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,040
greater challenge for companies and

339
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,959
governmental agencies who may require

340
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
elevated clearance to access files or

341
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,959
physical locations

342
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,800
this essentially removes the power and

343
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,560
control from the security authority by

344
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,079
obfuscating systems that can be

345
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,839
leveraged for nefarious purposes

346
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,680
so

347
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
let's continue with our first attack

348
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,360
vector this one's going to be around the

349
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
issue of physical access

350
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,720
any company will have restricted

351
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,480
locations on-prem whether that be

352
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,640
executive offices to supply rooms to

353
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
server rooms the need to keep access

354
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,640
restricted in some locations is just a

355
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,480
part of doing business

356
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,600
i'd be willing to bet that there's a

357
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,200
large number of number of people in

358
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
attendance that have some type of badge

359
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,839
on a lanyard

360
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,240
possibly i'd even be willing to bet that

361
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,680
uh

362
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,120
a lot of people out there would feel

363
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,800
that that type of a badge and reader

364
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,720
system is an acceptable risk from an

365
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,880
audit perspective and as such should

366
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,800
appease your c-level exacts to the fact

367
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,160
that your physical locations are secure

368
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,920
i really hope nobody here besides

369
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
believes that

370
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,880
you know

371
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,800
let's think about this how many of us

372
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,320
are spatially aware to the point where

373
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,839
if we were talking to someone like

374
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,760
me would you notice if i pull the small

375
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,920
tool like a proc smart chameleon mini

376
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,519
and was able to read your access bed

377
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,519
which while we were talking

378
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,880
i get it all the time there's no way

379
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,079
that somebody would be able to do that

380
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,120
to me

381
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,560
i hope you're right

382
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,000
i have countless case studies that

383
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,079
involve cloned access badges the act of

384
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,880
cloning access badges is not new

385
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,480
the technology has been commercially

386
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,560
available for over a decade

387
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,079
what makes this attack vector different

388
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,160
is there's no evidence of the breach

389
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,600
unlike the old days when an attacker

390
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,279
would need to have a copy of the clone

391
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
key or a battery pack for the prox mark

392
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,920
to replay the scrape data now attackers

393
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,120
can write this information to a

394
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
subdermal implant and proceed with no

395
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,279
way for a security professional to know

396
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,320
how or what they access the systems and

397
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,600
how the systems had actually been

398
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,800
compromised

399
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,360
so let me introduce the first attack

400
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,399
vector that we're going to be talking

401
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,639
about today this one's called handshake

402
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,639
handshake is a clone replay attack it

403
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,720
utilizes a tool like a prox mark to read

404
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,200
the data contained on a card or a fob

405
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,040
and then can store that and rewrite that

406
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,360
tag information into another tag

407
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,959
in this case it's going to be the tag

408
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,279
implant in my left hand

409
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,200
so let me show you what this looks like

410
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,480
in real life

411
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,880
so we're going to start off here with my

412
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,320
my mobile device

413
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
i'm going to open up the

414
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,800
proxmart chameleon tool

415
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,079
and we're going to go ahead and i'm

416
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,760
going to scan my badge and yes that is

417
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,160
my badge and yes i do look like every

418
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
piece of hacker clip art that any of us

419
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,920
have ever seen

420
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
so very quickly we can see that this is

421
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,480
a myfair classic card and i'm able to

422
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,320
import all of the uid and all of the

423
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,639
sector information

424
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,639
now keep in mind all of this can be done

425
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,199
while i'm standing there

426
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,800
so as we can see here i'm going to go

427
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,240
ahead and give this one a friendly name

428
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
i'm going to call this lens badge or

429
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,399
lens id i apologize

430
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,800
once we have this now we're going to go

431
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,240
ahead and we're going to

432
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,040
scan my hand

433
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,360
so

434
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,920
we go ahead and we use the proxmart mini

435
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,000
again

436
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,800
and scan the chip that is actually in my

437
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,680
hand we're now able to import a new chip

438
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
new uid

439
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,760
now for the purposes of this

440
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,320
demonstration i wanted to show just how

441
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,079
widely available and how broad sweeping

442
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,000
these types of things can be so we're

443
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,279
going to actually rename this one to

444
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,030
implant

445
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,480
[Music]

446
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,519
and now that we have both of them

447
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,720
i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to

448
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,360
upload these to a cloud storage so that

449
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,440
i have copies of them off-site and then

450
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,160
i'm going to pull them down into a new

451
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,720
application on the mobile device

452
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,959
so we're going to get them out

453
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,279
of the proxmark tool

454
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,440
save them up to google drive and then

455
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,360
we're going to redownload them and we're

456
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,880
going to import them into the myfair

457
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,399
classic tool on my mobile device

458
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,760
so my fair classic

459
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,040
now we're going to go ahead and we're

460
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,959
going to import the dumps from the

461
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,320
original two scans one from my badge

462
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,120
one from my hand

463
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,440
so real quickly

464
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,240
here we go in one import now let's go

465
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,279
ahead and let's import the second one

466
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,399
and the next thing we're going to do is

467
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,920
we're going to do a diff

468
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,279
and we'll notice that sector 0

469
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,639
line a

470
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,880
there will be differences between the

471
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,480
two as well they should be they're not

472
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,880
the same they're not identical they're

473
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,480
not cloned

474
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,240
so let's go ahead and pick the implant

475
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,600
first

476
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,480
then we're going to choose my id second

477
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,600
and we're going to run the diff and

478
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,160
we'll see that sector 0

479
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,800
line a is different

480
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,720
so now we're going to go ahead and we're

481
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,680
going to write the card or clone we're

482
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,759
going to select my id

483
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,680
and we're going to write this back down

484
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,560
to my hand

485
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,959
now certain chips have this ability

486
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,880
certain chips you would need to utilize

487
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
a different device in order to do this

488
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,800
again multiple

489
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,040
different

490
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,240
chips are available for different

491
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,560
functionality and different use cases

492
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,440
so just like that we write the tag

493
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
now let's go ahead and let's go ahead

494
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,399
and scan my hand and let's do another

495
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,720
diff

496
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,839
so new tag found

497
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,959
start mapping

498
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
and now that we've got that

499
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,519
we're going to go like i said we're

500
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,240
going to go back into the proxmark tool

501
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,920
go over to slot 3

502
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,000
and now we're going to scan my chip

503
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,319
again

504
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,520
in this case we're just going to do it

505
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,039
the easy way by clicking the button

506
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,679
and just like that

507
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,880
successful we have a new uid

508
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,640
we're gonna name this one implant two

509
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
just for friendly names and keep so that

510
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,079
way we can keep everybody on on the same

511
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,399
page

512
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,600
and now we can go ahead and we can do a

513
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,918
diff

514
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,960
again

515
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,400
and we will see

516
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,400
very quickly that the sector 0 line a

517
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,200
now

518
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,840
matches with the original scan from my

519
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,600
id

520
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,039
at this point i would be able to

521
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,440
compromise any physical access that

522
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,320
doesn't require a shield or a secondary

523
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,200
factor code in order to to access

524
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,080
physical locations

525
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,559
that is our first attack vector this

526
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,320
would provide no indications of

527
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,520
compromise if i was to be discovered in

528
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,799
a restricted location

529
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,640
so

530
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,760
moving on

531
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,080
into our next attack vector we're going

532
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
to be talking about nfc or near field

533
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,360
communication

534
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,960
this is an amazing technology that many

535
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,280
of us have in our pockets right now

536
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,200
every android device has full access to

537
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,919
transmit or receive nfc data apple's a

538
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,440
bit more complicated to explain

539
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,880
functionality

540
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,120
with ios 11

541
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,919
iphones 7 and 8 and x can be used to

542
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,840
read nfc tags

543
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
iphone 6 and 6s

544
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
can be used to make nfc payments with

545
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,080
apple pay but has no ability to read

546
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
standalone nfc tags

547
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,240
apple at this time only allows nfc tags

548
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,160
to be read via apps there's no native

549
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,320
support for native reads

550
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,919
i can almost hear all of the iphone

551
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,320
people out there cheering you get a pass

552
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,520
for now

553
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,640
i've not heard of anything on the

554
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,080
roadmap for iphones but as the

555
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,679
functionality continues to be adopted

556
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,760
for industries involving iot

557
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,440
i have to believe that apple is weighing

558
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,080
the security concerns of native access

559
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,520
very carefully

560
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,840
so like i just stated standard nfc

561
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
utilization can be almost anything from

562
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,520
beaming a file to a co-worker or a

563
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,000
friend to using a fob

564
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,760
or an app to transmit a signal to a

565
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,600
receiver to allow some action to take

566
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,160
place here's where it gets interesting

567
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,880
nfc gets its power from the receiver

568
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
there's no internal power required to be

569
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
able to keep a loaded tag and waiting

570
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,280
the implant that i'm going to be using

571
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,559
for this first attack is going to be

572
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,200
that flexness that flexnext that really

573
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,320
large nfc rfid chip

574
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
i will be showing two different attack

575
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,760
vectors that exploit nfc

576
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,160
the first one i call leprosy the second

577
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,520
one is called flesh hook same protocol

578
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,440
but a much different payload so

579
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,080
leprosy

580
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,640
the first attack leprosy this attack may

581
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,080
not always work as there are a few

582
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,600
conditions that need to be met in order

583
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,280
to execute properly

584
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,520
nfc must be enabled

585
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,440
and allow apps from unknown sources must

586
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,840
be enabled under the developer's tools

587
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,120
at this point it's a matter of social

588
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,640
engineering a situation where i can get

589
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,360
my hands physically on your device

590
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,679
i know i know i never let my cell phone

591
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,919
out of my sight i don't need it on your

592
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:20,720
site

593
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
this attack as well as flash hook are

594
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,799
designed to be performed in plain sight

595
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,640
and actually standing right next to my

596
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,520
victim

597
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,559
i don't think it would be a large

598
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,320
stretch to assume that if we were in the

599
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
same place together and i was to make

600
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,679
some kind of scene about an issue with

601
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,600
my wife or maybe a daughter or a

602
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
granddaughter and i was pleading for

603
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,120
somebody to help me make a phone call i

604
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,280
know the good samaritan someone would be

605
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,880
there to be my victim

606
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,640
we all have a built-in control and try

607
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,480
to avoid conflict as well as not wanting

608
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,880
to be viewed by our peers as uncaring

609
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,799
as an attacker i know this and will do

610
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,480
everything in my power to take advantage

611
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,520
of it

612
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
once the phone or tablet is in my hands

613
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,799
the receiver

614
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,320
in the device will pick up the tag i

615
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,080
have programmed in my hand that is

616
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,840
pointing to a web location containing an

617
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,240
infected apk that was created with msf

618
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,520
venom

619
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,039
anybody not familiar with that it's part

620
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,480
of the metasploit framework and is used

621
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,080
to create connections back to a command

622
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,440
control server

623
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,039
so i've gotten the device in my hands

624
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,960
the chip is prompted to either install

625
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,400
or save the file

626
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,640
i go through the motions of what appears

627
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
to be making a phone call what i'm

628
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
actually doing is loading the apk then

629
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,720
quickly returning the device back to you

630
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
this attack will provide persistence as

631
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,120
well as a hidden icon so the owner would

632
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,559
never be able to see anything out of the

633
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,400
ordinary as well as not being able to

634
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,159
find anything

635
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,240
in incriminating within your

636
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,840
applications list

637
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
what if this was a work phone

638
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,039
what if this was the device you do your

639
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,240
banking with

640
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,840
in this scenario i'm already in your

641
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,320
phone before i've even left the room

642
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,080
from the meta metasploit server i can

643
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,000
gain access to the contacts emails

644
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,600
photos downloads essentially anything

645
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,760
that's on that device

646
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,000
all right so now that i've explained it

647
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,360
let me show you guys what this looks

648
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,559
like

649
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,559
just to set everything up for y'all the

650
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,720
top window is my end rock session for

651
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,520
obfuscation and the bottom window is

652
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,400
going to be where i'm going to be

653
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,120
executing my metasploit attack

654
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,720
so we start off by launching metasploit

655
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,520
and

656
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,000
said i've already got a resource file so

657
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,840
we're going to go ahead and we're going

658
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,200
to just load up leprosy via ngrok and

659
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,880
exploit

660
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,240
from here

661
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,559
i want you to pay close attention to how

662
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,280
fast this happens oh my gosh i need help

663
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,200
somebody help me please

664
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
you know i need to make a phone call

665
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,520
that's it that fast

666
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,280
on the screen you'll see how quickly i

667
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,520
can actually pull this off all i need to

668
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,200
do is say download

669
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,799
you know all the while i can make it

670
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,799
look like i'm trying to remember what

671
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,039
the phone number is by this point i've

672
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,520
already got it down we click install we

673
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
agree to the installation

674
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,440
block by play protect but i don't want

675
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,799
it blocked so i'm going to go ahead and

676
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,720
actually open it anyway

677
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,400
continue

678
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,720
main activity done

679
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,320
that's all it took

680
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,960
i can hand you your device back

681
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
and go about my business

682
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,720
at this point if we can see from my

683
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,880
interpreter session i now have one open

684
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,960
session if i do assist info i'm on an

685
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,600
android 10 device i can dump the call

686
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,880
log we can dump sms we can even pop a

687
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,360
shell and start navigating the actual

688
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,000
directory structure of your phone

689
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,480
there's all

690
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,880
505 sms messages

691
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,280
now we've got the ability to navigate

692
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,160
through the system

693
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,440
[Music]

694
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,240
so

695
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,799
that is going to be our first attack

696
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,880
now again this one does require a little

697
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
bit of social engineering in the hope

698
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,200
that there's actually the ability to

699
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,480
enable those

700
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,400
unknown sources

701
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,480
for the final demonstration today i'd

702
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,880
like to introduce flesh hook in this

703
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,440
case i programmed the chip on my hand to

704
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,279
point to a very specific website that's

705
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,760
been compromised with the beef suite

706
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,919
beef is the browser exploit frame

707
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,240
extension framework this infects or

708
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,320
hooks the browsers of any devices that

709
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,159
it connects and allows remote code

710
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,640
execution as well as persistence

711
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,159
through the beef suite the attacker can

712
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,159
enumerate the local land the device is

713
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,240
connected to as well as execute advanced

714
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,559
phishing attacks executed on the device

715
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,760
itself

716
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,279
again this requires a little bit of

717
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,039
social engineering but as we just talked

718
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,440
about that shouldn't be a problem

719
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880
what makes this attack more dangerous

720
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,159
than leprosy is there's no need to

721
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,000
install anything along with the fact

722
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,919
that most mobile devices have some type

723
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,559
of web browser pre-installed nfc in a

724
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,480
browser are the only requirements for

725
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,000
this attack to work

726
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,440
so let's go ahead and let's take a quick

727
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,600
look at it

728
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,440
so we start out we go ahead and we

729
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,760
launch our beef suite

730
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,240
now again i'm not going to be focusing

731
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,520
too much on

732
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,039
the beef sweet exploit post-exploitation

733
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,679
my point behind this talk today was to

734
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,600
show how the human being can actually

735
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,000
become the attack vector so we'll walk

736
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,360
through the steps of the attack for the

737
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,039
purposes of

738
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,799
you know transparency

739
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,120
but we're not going to dig too deep into

740
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,720
the post exploit

741
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,400
so we go ahead and we launch our beef

742
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,799
suite

743
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,440
and you'll see that currently we have no

744
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,360
online browsers

745
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,840
so at this point let's go back again all

746
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,520
i need to social and do is social

747
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
engineer a situation where i can get

748
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,200
close to that phone

749
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
in this case i've actually made a

750
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
duplicate of the

751
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
putty website

752
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,279
which is actually in a clone that gives

753
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,120
me access within the beef

754
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,600
suite so as you can see that quickly now

755
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
i have a hooked browser

756
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,919
at this point i now have access to all

757
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,360
of the modules contained within beef

758
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,679
so we can actually go ahead and

759
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,760
navigate and use some of those modules

760
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,679
and within the current browser

761
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,919
getting geolocation

762
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,360
uh

763
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,039
and yeah we're going to do this just for

764
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,720
the sake of argument to show that i am

765
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,640
connected

766
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,360
and it's going to return a location here

767
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,159
in

768
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,919
very close to me the uh which would

769
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,480
probably be the actual hub location and

770
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
it says as you can see here it says name

771
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,000
texas city flugade

772
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,880
and

773
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
now if i get the network connection we

774
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,559
can just bounce around in here a little

775
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,279
bit

776
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,360
any of these commands would be available

777
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,520
within the suite and once the initial

778
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,440
connection has been made

779
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
there's nothing to stop the attacker

780
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,559
from utilizing any one of these

781
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,760
so

782
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,520
let's take a few moments just to talk

783
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,840
about where we're going and what will we

784
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,679
become

785
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,039
when we talk about the future of

786
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,039
implants is it if we're trying to write

787
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,200
some new science fiction movie

788
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,720
companies like tesla are working on

789
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,320
technologies like the neural link a

790
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,600
brain implant that will allow

791
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
interfacing between the brain directly

792
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,440
to a computer system this sounds like a

793
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,279
man-in-the-middle scenario just waiting

794
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,559
to happen

795
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,799
products like the will it a bluetooth

796
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,799
receiver that requires no batteries and

797
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,559
gets its power from the air and we all

798
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,600
know that bluetooth is really safe right

799
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,440
ever heard of blueborne

800
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,279
imagine if that attack could jump from

801
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,120
person to person

802
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,880
or what about implantable wi-fi

803
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,880
transmitters there's a product in

804
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,279
development called the neurobrain

805
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,880
nobody's ever been able to compromise

806
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,200
wifi networks what if your next-door

807
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,840
neighbor was the wi-fi net mesh network

808
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,520
that you're compromising

809
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,919
these are just a few that we know about

810
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,440
currently the biggest restriction to

811
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,520
advanced technology and implants is the

812
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,440
power source there's not currently an

813
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
effective way to provide clean power for

814
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,559
any devices on a commercial implant this

815
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,000
is the same issue that we saw with the

816
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,440
peg leg and the need for the indirect

817
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,600
fast charging receiver it's not always

818
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,200
the computer technology that needs to

819
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,320
catch up

820
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,520
in this case the only thing that's

821
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,799
holding back progress as i said is power

822
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,240
once that's been addressed the

823
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,640
possibility of 24x7 access to an

824
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,080
embedded system in the body is really

825
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,960
not a far stretch

826
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,480
i want to take a moment to talk about

827
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,120
just the legality morality and ethical

828
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,240
issues around implanted technologies

829
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,919
from and i'm going to speak only from

830
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:06,640
the

831
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,120
uh united states perspective

832
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,880
from a legal perspective there are no

833
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,120
federal laws within the u.s regarding

834
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,799
microchip implants

835
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,399
at the state levels you can see from the

836
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,480
graphics there are multiple states that

837
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,840
have adopted different types of

838
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,159
legislation there's essentially two

839
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,240
types of laws that have been passed here

840
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,120
in the us around microchip implants one

841
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,080
is mainly focuses around employers and

842
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,000
one that's very general

843
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,720
the first one is a ban that employers

844
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,240
can mandate

845
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,159
employee microchipping for time cards or

846
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,159
any type of business purpose

847
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,440
the second law is just a general ban on

848
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,080
microchips period

849
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,679
let's talk about liability from an

850
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,159
employer's perspective if an employee

851
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,240
gets chipped does that in and of itself

852
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,399
make that employee a security risk what

853
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:57,919
if they're just using the chip to access

854
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,080
a gym or a garage and has nothing to do

855
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,159
with the company but that chip could be

856
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,159
used for in an offensive manner would

857
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,840
that be something that a ciso would want

858
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,880
to know

859
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,640
we allow employees to bring personal

860
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,880
phones to work excluding the restricted

861
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,960
areas but detection is really a lot more

862
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,559
obvious

863
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,080
much of our current legislation here

864
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,240
stems from a push to replace access

865
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,919
badges with implants for physical

866
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,240
security but as that may help from a i

867
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,159
lost my badge perspective it doesn't

868
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,760
enhance the security posture for a

869
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,960
company

870
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,279
remember implant chips at this point are

871
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,320
static

872
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,880
they require a reader or a power source

873
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,799
to be able to function now just like

874
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,559
with the handshake attack bad actors

875
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,240
could use those same tools and scrape

876
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,840
the targets implants information the

877
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,080
same as if it was a physical card

878
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,760
the one main difference is that you can

879
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,399
take your your access card and lock it

880
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,320
up at home when you're going out

881
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,880
on the weekend to go party

882
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,799
if you've got an implant they are on all

883
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,360
of the time if there's a receiver within

884
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,760
range they will read that chip there is

885
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,559
no current off switch and as such

886
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,360
attackers would then have 24x7

887
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,399
access

888
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,080
simply by getting close to your your

889
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
physical being

890
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,399
when the concept of morality and ethics

891
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,279
come up

892
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,600
the topic of faith has typically has

893
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,760
come into these discussions first i want

894
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,600
to take a moment to say that i'm in no

895
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,440
way trying to be disrespectful to any

896
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,760
religion or faith and i'm only speaking

897
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,200
to questions that i have personally

898
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,320
heard

899
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,000
as an international speaker i've had

900
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,520
discussions with people all over the

901
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,919
world about my implants the discussions

902
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,240
typically go in one of two directions

903
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
mostly it starts with fear from whoever

904
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,000
is talking to me i've been told that i

905
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,760
have the mark of the beast i've been

906
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,919
told that i'm being tracked by the man

907
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,679
i've even been asked if this is the same

908
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,600
chip that people have in their dogs or

909
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,039
cats

910
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,720
all of these conversations are driven by

911
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,600
the fear of the different or the unknown

912
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,279
i've had acquaintances tell me that they

913
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,880
are physically afraid of me due to my

914
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,399
implants i don't really know what

915
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,760
they're afraid of it's almost as if they

916
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,720
think i'm going to turn into a

917
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,559
terminator and go on to go on some kind

918
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,080
of a rampage

919
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,679
the truth is that there are more people

920
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,399
out here like me than you could imagine

921
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,919
the difference is i don't have a problem

922
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,039
with people knowing who and what i am

923
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,559
many others like me keep their implant

924
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,720
secrets over the concerns of the social

925
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,200
stigma associated with microchips

926
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,960
the decision to augment ourselves should

927
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,120
not hold any weight in regards to the

928
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,080
issues of faith or morality provided

929
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,519
that the decision is still left with the

930
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,080
individual and not a mandate from any

931
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
type of authority like i said earlier

932
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,080
not all of us are friendly but most of

933
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,760
us are

934
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,320
finally how far is too far

935
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,080
we briefly touched on the tesla

936
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,320
neurolink and the peg leg these are two

937
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,519
very different products with broad

938
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,039
sweeping ramifications for the

939
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,799
individual as well as the employers in

940
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,240
law enforcement

941
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,039
i remember a movie from back in 1995

942
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,600
called johnny mnemonic where the lead

943
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,679
the lead actors had has a hard drive in

944
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,279
his brain and it's used as a storage

945
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,320
device by a courier for stolen data

946
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,360
or the matrix where we learn a new skill

947
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,279
just by uploading the information the

948
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,799
instruction set and then we have it

949
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,480
you know the genie's out of the bottle

950
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,679
and there's no way that it's going to go

951
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,840
back in as technology continues to

952
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,000
advance and improve the quality of life

953
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,600
we need to remember that any tool

954
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,360
regardless of what its original intent

955
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,760
was can be misused as security

956
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,279
professionals we need to be aware of

957
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,120
this and adapt our countermeasures to

958
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,360
include these new attack vectors

959
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,760
the fact that there's nothing unilateral

960
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,679
across the board as far as legislation

961
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,600
within the united states or europe to

962
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,440
the best of my knowledge

963
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,679
this becomes a corporate decision on how

964
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,080
to address shipped employees

965
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,360
without a better understanding of the

966
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,919
technologies being discussed

967
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,760
these choices may be made for the wrong

968
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,480
reasons to say anyone with an implanted

969
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,240
technology is an automatic threat would

970
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
be like saying that any car owner is a

971
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,159
potential vehicular manslaughter suspect

972
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,600
so

973
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,080
i want to give you a couple of takeaways

974
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,039
in the next couple of weeks audit your

975
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,960
contactless protocols for vulnerable

976
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,480
technologies

977
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,799
if there's anything at all know what it

978
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,519
is

979
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,360
within the next three months

980
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,880
take you should have a really good

981
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,159
understanding of the scope of your

982
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,840
vulnerabilities as well as starting to

983
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,679
evaluate and define the addition of new

984
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,919
security protocols to add a second

985
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,200
factor to your contactless

986
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,720
configurations

987
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
and within the next six months we should

988
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
be at the implementation stage of that

989
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,640
second factor this will remove an

990
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
attacker's ability to compromise access

991
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,279
with only tech excuse me

992
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,760
uh written tag information

993
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,600
and i wanted to take just a moment to

994
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,960
talk about some of the mitigation

995
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,640
strategies around both nfc and rfid

996
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,799
you know look into switches switches

997
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,880
require both the rfid tag as well as a

998
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,120
code to be entered into a keypad

999
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,279
essentially contactless mfa

1000
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,080
lock passwords this is a 32-bit password

1001
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,840
which must be transmitted before the tag

1002
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
will transmit its data

1003
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,120
utilizing this will take care of

1004
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,640
skimmers

1005
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
basic access control the reader must

1006
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,480
supply a specific key before the tag

1007
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,960
will reveal any personal information

1008
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,120
blocking potential skimming

1009
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,519
mutual authentication in this process

1010
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,199
the sensor will send a line of code to

1011
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,879
the tag which will decipher it using the

1012
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,119
key which is known to both entities if

1013
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,040
the tag is successful it can send then

1014
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,760
send a line of code similarly deciphered

1015
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,879
to the reader

1016
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,239
once both the tag and the reader are

1017
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,159
certain that neither is an imposter they

1018
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,159
can transmit their data this method

1019
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,239
prevents anyone from stealing any data

1020
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,839
from that tag

1021
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,760
let's take a minute to talk about nfc

1022
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,000
the most important advice in regards to

1023
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,119
nfc

1024
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,440
if you're not using it turn it off

1025
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,159
stay on top of patch management as

1026
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,839
manufacturers update firmware be

1027
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,320
vigilant in staying current

1028
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,199
education educate your employees that

1029
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,119
about the fact that nfc

1030
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,560
is a non-secure protocol at its core

1031
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,719
and utilize blocking shields for tags

1032
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,560
when not in use

1033
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,440
and just to prove the the seriousness of

1034
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,640
the idea of blocking shields

1035
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,160
i actually had faraday gloves created

1036
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,560
for me to be able to put on my hands to

1037
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,880
shut my tags off

1038
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880
so

1039
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,640
that is about all i have today uh i do

1040
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,800
have a few minutes left as far as i can

1041
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
tell i think

1042
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,560
uh so i will be able to take just a

1043
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,880
couple of questions finally i wanted to

1044
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,640
provide just my information one more

1045
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,839
time

1046
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,960
uh i'd like to say first and foremost

1047
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,760
again thank you to the b-sides barcelona

1048
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,000
for giving me the opportunity to speak

1049
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,800
and i hope that you found this

1050
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,520
presentation educational as well as

1051
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,200
entertaining

1052
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,760
so thank you very much

1053
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,720
and

1054
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,118
i'll i am open to questions at this time

1055
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,640
thank you very much len that was very

1056
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,920
interesting and this is like

1057
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,760
mind-blowing the first time i i heard

1058
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,880
about this

1059
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,640
and so far like we don't have any

1060
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,560
questions on the q a but i do have

1061
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,200
questions uh and i can't for some reason

1062
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,520
soon does not allow me as a host to ask

1063
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,599
on the q a so uh

1064
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,839
i get the time to to ask them here so my

1065
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,320
first question is around the maintenance

1066
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,440
of the implants like what is it like do

1067
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,640
you have to

1068
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,599
patch your implants from time to time no

1069
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,000
no they're static tags

1070
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,960
so they essentially just are in a static

1071
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,040
state uh there hasn't been any firmware

1072
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
type of updates to them

1073
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
uh if there are then i would be

1074
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,119
definitely staying on top of that but at

1075
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,960
this point they're just passive tags

1076
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,359
that get all power from the reader and

1077
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:40,720
you know like i was saying earlier you

1078
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,599
know i do i added the biosensing magnet

1079
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,520
this one is not a lifting magnet this

1080
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,920
one if i get actually close to magnets

1081
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,119
or

1082
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,800
large motors i can actually feel the

1083
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
electromagnetic current

1084
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,640
from a physical pen testing perspective

1085
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,160
if we're dealing with magnetic locks on

1086
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,520
the outside of a building that gives you

1087
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,880
the ability to run your hand over the

1088
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,520
walls to locate where those electric

1089
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,880
lines are that would be going to that

1090
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,880
magnetic lock at which point then you

1091
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,720
can try and do some type of interruption

1092
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,160
of service to that to bypass those locks

1093
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,480
so yeah everything on me

1094
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,960
all of my implants are for the sole

1095
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,640
purposes of offensive technology

1096
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,720
cool cool uh

1097
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,200
so another question is like as i said

1098
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,560
this is like the first time i heard

1099
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,119
about it so i'm curious if there is uh

1100
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,839
any type of books that talk more in

1101
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,240
depth about all of this

1102
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,160
to be honest i'm the for the best of my

1103
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,560
knowledge i'm the first one of us that's

1104
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,960
actually come out and spoke on these

1105
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,200
topics in a large forum

1106
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
there are quite a few open testers that

1107
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
i do know personally that do have

1108
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,960
implants for the purposes of red team

1109
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,839
exercises and physical penetration

1110
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,800
testing but

1111
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,280
to the best of my knowledge back uh i

1112
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,760
did i've introduced this topic at rsa

1113
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,480
this year this last february in the u.s

1114
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,119
but i do believe i'm one of the first

1115
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,520
uh there's an amazing you know

1116
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,680
again i don't get a kickback from

1117
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,200
dangerous things

1118
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,920
but they are probably one of the best

1119
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,880
commercial grade implant manufacturers

1120
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,200
their forums are some of the most

1121
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,520
knowledgeable if this is something that

1122
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,680
anybody even finds remotely interesting

1123
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,520
i would highly suggest just go over

1124
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,440
there join the forums you don't have to

1125
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,320
be

1126
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,240
a transhuman or somebody with an implant

1127
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,520
to join

1128
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,240
but

1129
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,200
they're very friendly very open and we

1130
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,599
can you know if you have any questions

1131
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,800
we are more than welcome to answer them

1132
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,880
everything from uh you know

1133
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,880
you know what what type of answers to

1134
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,839
give

1135
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,440
potential zealots about being implanted

1136
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,680
to how do you secure your implants at

1137
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,480
places like def con or black hat

1138
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
you know it's it's a great resource for

1139
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,640
anybody that's into the implant

1140
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,119
technology and contactless

1141
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,839
bio human

1142
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,000
transition interesting thank you so much

1143
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,839
questions is

1144
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,079
when you decide like you want to build

1145
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,400
one of these implants like where do you

1146
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,440
go do you go to your doctor and tell us

1147
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,480
like i need you to implant this on me

1148
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,280
um

1149
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,680
i i know that there are some people that

1150
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,800
have gone to doctors to have them put in

1151
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,440
here within the in where i live we

1152
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,760
actually have body modification parlors

1153
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,480
that do body piercings and brandings

1154
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,920
and uh

1155
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,079
that my all of my implants were actually

1156
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,800
put in by uh my body modification

1157
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,119
expert his name is actually pineapple

1158
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,280
shout out to pineapple at shaman tatsu

1159
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,200
her shaman modifications here in austin

1160
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,920
texas uh but if you're interested in

1161
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,680
something like this one other thing that

1162
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,800
is on the dangerous things forum is a

1163
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,000
installers forum and there are different

1164
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,800
people in multiple countries

1165
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,720
around the world that actually do do the

1166
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,640
implants because it's definitely not

1167
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,000
something that you would want to go to

1168
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
someone that has never done it

1169
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,400
uh unless it's one of the

1170
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,480
glass encapsulated implants that just

1171
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,520
comes in a preloaded large gauge syringe

1172
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,720
kind of like you would expect with a

1173
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,960
like a body piercing and it's just

1174
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,920
injected any of the flex series do

1175
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,960
require scalpels dermal elevators

1176
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,160
stitches

1177
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,280
and it's it is a minor surgery

1178
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,400
so

1179
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,520
again if that's something you're

1180
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,440
interested in definitely check the the

1181
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,680
installers list off the forums to find

1182
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,440
somebody that is knowledgeable in this

1183
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,160
processing procedure

1184
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,720
awesome thank you for the for that and

1185
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,040
my last question i believe right here is

1186
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,960
about the off switch you mentioned that

1187
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,000
there is no off switch right now so that

1188
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,560
kind of two questions like one is why uh

1189
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
is there like any

1190
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,480
is there like a

1191
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
some kind of blocker that does not allow

1192
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,520
to have something yeah yeah the reason

1193
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,240
like i said right now we have no ability

1194
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,800
to power any type of commercial grade

1195
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,720
implant internally

1196
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,920
so your rfid nfc all the chips that i

1197
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,319
have and i would say pretty much all the

1198
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,920
chips that are out there on the market

1199
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,839
today i mean there's there's a really

1200
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,440
cool one that just came out in the uk

1201
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,440
it's called the wallet more

1202
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,560
and it allows you to actually link your

1203
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,880
debit card to this implant and allows

1204
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,880
you to use your hand on the tap to pay

1205
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,319
systems like apple pay or android wallet

1206
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,079
um

1207
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,880
to turn them off you do need you know

1208
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,800
allow me to back up like i said these

1209
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,200
are all passive tags once they're

1210
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,240
written

1211
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,160
they just sit there they get all power

1212
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,319
from the readers there's no internal

1213
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,319
power so there is no way to really turn

1214
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,280
it off outside of using faraday cloth or

1215
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,520
some type of blocking shield

1216
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,880
to that point like i said at the end of

1217
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,920
my my session there i actually went out

1218
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,880
and bought faraday blocking fabric and

1219
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,760
actually paid a seamstress to sew it

1220
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,839
inside of a pair of gloves

1221
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,240
so that's the only way that i can be

1222
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,119
sure

1223
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,359
somebody else isn't trying to write data

1224
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,760
to my implants at places like def con or

1225
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,520
black hat or you know some of the other

1226
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,240
security conferences that i go to

1227
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,599
so yeah it's just a matter of

1228
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,280
once you write it

1229
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,800
you're utilizing the power from the

1230
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,440
reader to perform the right action

1231
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
and once that gets taken away it just

1232
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,839
stays in a passive state until another

1233
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,560
power device is close enough to actually

1234
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,160
power the chip and read

1235
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,040
cool thank you very much so that is all

1236
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,359
the questions i have for the moment uh

1237
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,200
so some people might contact you in this

1238
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,760
