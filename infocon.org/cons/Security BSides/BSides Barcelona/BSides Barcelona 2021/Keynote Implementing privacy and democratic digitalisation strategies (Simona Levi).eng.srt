21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,039
what i'm doing here in the sense that

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,120
they have a huge admiration for your

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,079
crowd i i am founder of an organization

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,400
of digital right in spain pretty known

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,520
is called x-net we are

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,880
hanging around since 2008

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,520
but i am not technologist

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,960
at all in fact i uh in my group i am

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,520
used as a beta tester

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,320
uh so that uh

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,159
when when they want to test some

32
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,479
technology and see if it's user-friendly

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,920
for very bad

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,560
skilled user they ask me

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,079
so uh

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,040
but i think what they want me to

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,280
the reason why

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
the friend of the organization want me

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,119
to be here is because

40
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,960
we are trying with xnet to lead

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,479
a project

42
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,560
in the school so i think

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,119
there is much that we can bring as the

44
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,399
user of

45
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,280
you all do and uh very much what is

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,799
needed for

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,880
the institution to understand in order

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
in order to not make

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,439
very bad mistake in policymaking

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,840
on this

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,720
i

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,360
i am pretty skilled i i am 40-year

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,879
activist uh

54
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,520
i'm doing active in since 40 years so

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,599
i've tried to

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,959
um

57
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,200
to have conversation with many many

58
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,680
institutions and in this moment we are

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
having a project

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,080
we create we dixnet

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,319
plan which is called the plan for

62
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,640
democratic digitalization

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,560
because we were approached in 2019

64
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,840
by a group of families of mothers and

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,400
fathers of kids in in school pretty

66
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,760
small kids 9 4

67
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,280
4 5 6 10 years old

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,480
that they were

69
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,920
um

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,239
this is was even before the covet they

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,599
they were they in school they asked uh

72
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,519
them to to sign the authorization

73
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,360
uh for

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,959
their scholarization by using completely

75
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,010
only

76
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,480
[Music]

77
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,959
some of the big tech

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,840
suite for for education

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,480
and some family that didn't want to sign

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,360
because they had uh some

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,720
uh problem with the the privacy politics

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
or the danger of what it can mean that

83
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,720
you have all that your digitalization in

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
uh in a cloud that is not sovereign that

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
the the school doesn't control et cetera

86
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,519
et cetera

87
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,959
uh was worrying for them and uh but

88
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,040
if they didn't sign

89
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,159
uh the other alternative was for the kid

90
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,959
to to just be excluded from from the

91
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,360
activity in the class so we saw that

92
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
there is

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,360
uh

94
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,159
no alternative at the moment in school

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,799
this uh plan and uh is uh is created for

96
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,640
catalonia because in spain the

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,959
competency on education are

98
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,239
regional for for the autonomia so this

99
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,519
is the

100
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,920
design for catalonia but

101
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,680
we of course

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,079
now know pretty a lot about the subject

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
and we know that

104
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,440
in spain is the same but not only in

105
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,560
spain also in europe and probably not

106
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
only in europe now our research just

107
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,759
reached reaches europe but i'm pretty

108
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,720
sure

109
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,759
uh that the situation is not only in in

110
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,960
europe so

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,840
uh our essential public services like

112
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,759
education or

113
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,639
uh

114
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,960
health even the world the whole

115
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,360
administration are

116
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,840
uh done are left

117
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,000
uh

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,560
they are not digitalized in in a

119
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,639
particular way they are

120
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,400
our uh government are just not

121
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
uh

122
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,320
not busy with the business of

123
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,639
doing nothing about the digitalization

124
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,800
of the structure so this huge gap

125
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,320
left in the digitalization of societies

126
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,440
by

127
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,400
the

128
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
the lack of duty of care of the

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,720
institution left the door open of the

130
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,560
digitalization

131
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,479
completely designed on on idea of

132
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,639
corporate profit which

133
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,280
i am in favor so i mean

134
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
corporation enterprises small big or

135
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,560
huge are doing their job they

136
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,479
look for a place where they can have a

137
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,320
business and they do the business the

138
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,960
problem what i'm criticizing here is the

139
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,000
lack of

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,120
uh

141
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,320
of uh

142
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,199
uh

143
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,919
duty of care from the institutions this

144
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:46,960
is why

145
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,120
my um

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,080
my

147
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,360
talk uh man my the title of my talk is

148
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,320
just

149
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,600
mentioning uh a line that i like very

150
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,319
much from an author which is uh

151
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,319
alejandro barrico

152
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,560
say that we are guided by an elite that

153
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,880
use digital technology but not digital

154
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,199
rationality and when i give this talk

155
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,039
then i have a long

156
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,360
explanation on what i

157
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,720
mean by

158
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,800
uh digital uh

159
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,280
rationality and but today i really don't

160
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
think i have to

161
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,800
do this part of the talk because i'm

162
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,120
sure we all share this idea that the

163
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,840
network activity uh bring to this

164
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,120
intermediation bring to uh

165
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,840
a way of

166
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,679
means of transparency and

167
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,360
to reading the governance which are

168
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,319
much more not only efficient but

169
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,479
democratic in the very sense of the

170
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,520
etymology which is uh

171
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,759
the people having the authority

172
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,639
um

173
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,520
but so what what is more interesting

174
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
that may be

175
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,440
for for

176
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
the community that you represent uh what

177
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,800
i think is more uh

178
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,960
important is a bit to

179
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,440
ask for your help in fact because as i

180
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,240
say

181
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,360
really much

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
of admiration of all the work and i

183
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
would like to have

184
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,120
a little of all the skills you have

185
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,120
uh so a bit

186
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,759
sharing with you the

187
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,440
the surrounding in which the

188
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,000
digitalization is happening

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
uh as

190
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,840
in in the policy making field

191
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,960
as a digital right activist as a citizen

192
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,800
that want that the digital age is an age

193
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,280
of democracy and and not the opposite

194
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,680
way around um

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,039
in in

196
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,360
in this context i

197
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,639
um

198
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
i think we can divide the the way of how

199
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,879
we see it in into in two parts

200
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,479
um

201
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,440
just a second i skip this this part

202
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
so

203
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
what i'd like to

204
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,280
um what i'm trying to to explain uh we

205
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,680
have designed around this uh project as

206
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,400
i was explaining this

207
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,240
plan which is called the plan for

208
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,960
democratic digitalization and from this

209
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,280
plan we have produced a prototype i will

210
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,879
tell you after

211
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,559
but this uh um what i'm trying to to

212
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,919
explain

213
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,360
to the policy makers is that

214
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,399
when they now the digitalization since

215
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,479
you have the next generation money and

216
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,599
all these

217
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,519
certainly our governments uh uh

218
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,600
see that there is a digitalization going

219
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,839
on especially the covet have helped them

220
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,000
to see but of course digitalization is

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
already going on for half a century

222
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,760
and uh and digital the internet is not

223
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,920
what what they

224
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,800
know now is now is uh

225
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,760
uh

226
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,880
uh

227
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,680
we got fun is not the internet we know

228
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
that gaffer is not the internet but

229
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,760
often policy makers since they do policy

230
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,120
viagra fans or or similar entities they

231
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,200
think that this is the internet

232
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,440
and this is very dangerous because all

233
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
other possibilities for

234
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,519
they cannot imagine they don't know that

235
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,640
there is something there is real life

236
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,600
uh

237
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,320
behind that no it's like imagining the

238
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,640
public uh the public space as a big

239
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,600
like like in the novel knows no crash as

240
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,560
is if the public space was just

241
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,120
uh parcel that belongs to one or or or

242
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,519
or very few big company and we all are

243
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,040
clients in each part of our life of this

244
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,279
company and we know that the internet is

245
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,680
not this but the policy maker they don't

246
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,279
know so what

247
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,720
it is for me important and i'd like you

248
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,839
all to help me and to bring around this

249
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,600
hema that i just

250
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,480
uh

251
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,959
when whenever you have the occasion to

252
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:15,920
use a

253
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,320
essential service or to or to have

254
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
contact with the the responsible for

255
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,399
this digitalization of societies that uh

256
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,079
we um

257
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,480
and i imagine the the digitalization of

258
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,839
society as

259
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,600
e-participation which is okay i'm not

260
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
against e-participation but this idea

261
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
that we we we push all the people doing

262
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,260
um

263
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,079
[Music]

264
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,880
what we in exnet we call it occupational

265
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,600
digital so we

266
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,120
we keep them busy with

267
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
blinking

268
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,920
useless um think of participation that

269
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,640
will not be taken in account without

270
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,720
learning anything of

271
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,680
the communities that they they are they

272
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,480
are get

273
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,800
all organized for a long long time the

274
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,279
unlike communities uh having learned

275
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,640
nothing about the hacker philosophy or

276
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,760
not even even heard about etc

277
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,279
and um and so or

278
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,279
media literacy because now this

279
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,839
information is because of the internet

280
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,519
instead of understanding that this

281
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,240
information is because before they had

282
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,040
the the monopoly of manipulation of the

283
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,880
information and the propaganda and now

284
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,040
this monopolies is

285
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,600
uh broken by uh

286
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,160
this internet system which permit a

287
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,800
better surveillance and other sources of

288
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
information etc etc

289
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,640
but a part of this they already does

290
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,920
they already do this pretty

291
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,240
[Music]

292
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,600
not well but they

293
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
don't know that before

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,040
uh

295
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,399
all this there is digitalization itself

296
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,760
which is

297
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,440
which tools do we use while no you know

298
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,360
is it possible that

299
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,560
our

300
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,959
calendar of our

301
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:13,920
health

302
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,000
the the health system

303
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
calendar

304
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,639
with all our private private data on

305
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,000
health for example covet etc

306
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,320
is linked directly to a google calendar

307
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,639
what kind of policy is behind this why

308
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,279
they don't ask themselves

309
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,160
how such huge services that in the case

310
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,040
of education is is providing in

311
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,079
education uh we have uh uh

312
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,800
in catalonia only in catalonia one

313
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
million and only from for public

314
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,200
education one million students

315
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,920
so why

316
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,560
in the politics is not ask

317
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,320
how we can be possible that a

318
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,680
corporation which is so a for-profit

319
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
company

320
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,839
is

321
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,680
uh interest in giving us for free the

322
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,560
digitalization of one million persons

323
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,079
kids

324
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,040
right

325
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,320
so

326
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,040
it is important that we

327
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,360
force we actively demand for a

328
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,360
digitalization that has privacy but not

329
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,760
only privacy interoperability

330
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,399
sovereignty of data

331
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,720
invaluability of communication we all

332
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,560
use gmail so which is uh you know kids

333
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
having gmail with four years old and

334
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,240
being captive of

335
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,519
a a concrete type of

336
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,240
email services for probably all their

337
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,279
life

338
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,680
uh net neutrality of course

339
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,560
the auditability of the code

340
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,440
uh

341
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,040
etc etc freedom of expression etc that

342
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,399
we have to rebuild the digitalization of

343
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,079
our society

344
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,440
on

345
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,920
tools that have the security of course

346
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,240
but this is a field that i leave it up

347
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,959
to you because i'm not very good at it

348
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,240
but uh they are very worried on security

349
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,880
so this is this is okay this is a good

350
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,720
news this is the part of the story that

351
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,399
they have understood

352
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,120
but

353
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,279
all the other elements security is not

354
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,800
enough

355
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,120
we need society that also are

356
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,600
beneficial with all this

357
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,560
by default and by decide that

358
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,800
design

359
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
rights

360
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,199
um the situation is

361
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,519
um

362
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,920
so okay i go back for to uh um

363
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,480
to our own prototype so we do a design

364
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,959
of something in fact it's it's pretty

365
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,959
simple what we propose

366
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,560
uh

367
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,680
is basically to uh

368
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,320
to have a sovereign

369
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,920
digitalization which consists

370
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,199
in using

371
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,839
first of all servers that you control

372
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,360
and servers that

373
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,079
are respecting the relation between them

374
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,320
and the client and the client shouldn't

375
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,399
be the state the client should be their

376
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,440
client so in this case the schools or

377
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,279
the hospital or

378
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,519
me and you

379
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,480
so we we propose to change the servers

380
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,880
that some servers that if they resi

381
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,279
receive a requirement from

382
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,000
from the from the authority

383
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,160
will inform the client because they

384
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,880
consider the people

385
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,399
as the smallest unit of democracy the

386
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,279
client and not only the authority the

387
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,720
client

388
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,839
uh

389
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:48,880
and

390
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,000
and then

391
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,519
the other idea is to is is something

392
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,480
absolutely obvious is to create to use

393
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,959
open source software so that they can be

394
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,560
distributedly

395
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,120
auditable in school but

396
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,440
to uh to solve the problem that because

397
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,519
this is we didn't invent of course

398
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,839
always we had in school also the

399
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,519
possibility to have open source of

400
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,759
course but the problem is that people

401
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,480
don't adopt it because of a lack of

402
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,639
usability and because

403
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,000
what this

404
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,240
the big tech have done with the suite is

405
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
that they have aggregate all the tools

406
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,079
which for someone that doesn't know

407
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,440
anything about

408
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,120
digital and doesn't

409
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,800
want to know anything about digital

410
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,199
because he's busy with other fights

411
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,040
which is not the digital

412
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,000
make them the life too difficult so they

413
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,600
will for for sure use so the thing is to

414
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,279
force

415
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,399
institution that up till now they were

416
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,480
leaving leaving blank field with just by

417
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
retreating themselves like in the fight

418
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,120
and leaving the space

419
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
to big text to occupy the spaces and be

420
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
taking it because it's their business

421
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,199
and they are right in doing that

422
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,400
so uh asking

423
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,199
uh

424
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,760
uh asking uh institutions to take the

425
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,000
resp their responsibility because if not

426
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,720
i don't know why we we paid them the

427
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,359
uh the their their daily their their

428
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,720
monthly money

429
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,919
um

430
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:20,880
to

431
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,760
give

432
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,280
to option that have the design by

433
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,480
default and

434
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,200
of sovereignty by defaulty by design

435
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,160
to

436
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,440
inverse in

437
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,280
code already existing

438
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,440
open source code already existing such

439
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,240
as

440
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,960
let's cloud moodle ether path blue

441
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,320
bottom gypsy blah blah blah blah and to

442
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,120
aggregate in the in one only suite but i

443
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
don't want to speak with you

444
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,760
of technicality because you beat me um

445
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,039
i'm sure with i i cannot even ask most

446
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,200
of your questions so we are basically

447
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,520
creating a

448
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,840
suite only with traceable and only in uh

449
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,720
very consolidate open source tools

450
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,840
uh

451
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,600
is constituted by by

452
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,360
blocks that can be

453
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,160
an end a big part on interoperability

454
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,280
with other tools both with the open

455
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,520
source or private uh

456
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
source code

457
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
so interoperability is also very

458
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,000
important because many of the format

459
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,480
that they have they create in the school

460
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,840
then they cannot anymore recuperated

461
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,679
for example a

462
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,160
google site or

463
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
for example we have seen now that a lot

464
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,039
of

465
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,880
classes are are

466
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,919
completely

467
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,799
built and teached

468
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,919
with the google site which is great

469
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,799
but

470
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,480
you can't it's it's not in interoperable

471
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,120
format so you cannot bring all your work

472
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,600
as a teacher for example or a student

473
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,280
somewhere else if you decide that you

474
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,200
don't like anymore this provider

475
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,760
so with this we have done a prototype

476
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,160
it's already functioning in in three

477
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,559
school in barcelona

478
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,640
we had this we tried to add the support

479
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,640
of the catalan government but we we

480
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,720
didn't get it at the moment they should

481
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,600
be responsible for education but they

482
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,679
are not very much interested in this

483
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,400
story

484
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,720
but maybe they change your mind because

485
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,200
the one that we are uh

486
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,559
prototyping

487
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,799
in barcelona it's working very well

488
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,720
uh it's only three school but we have

489
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,440
already other 15 asking in barcelona

490
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,760
only and we have not yet

491
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,000
done a big big propaganda

492
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,520
and other 40 asking for all catalonia

493
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,919
and i'm sure that this prototype which

494
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,320
will be of course open source etc and

495
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,120
it's already online um

496
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,480
will it is shareable for many other

497
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,679
situation and

498
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,080
many other

499
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,480
not only education in many many other

500
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,600
places and countries and but also in

501
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,080
other fields like administration help

502
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,440
etc

503
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,960
so uh

504
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
but and now i am

505
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,559
i want to just to finish go to another

506
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,600
piece so from from prototyping

507
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,919
so we we did a plan then we did a

508
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,799
prototype and we tried to install and we

509
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,039
installed a prototype and

510
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,039
and check how it works

511
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,520
uh and from this experience we have

512
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,280
learned many other things

513
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,679
which i just want to share with you a

514
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,120
couple of them

515
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,280
because they are related to the market

516
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,919
and to the fact that the talent that you

517
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,559
have that i'm sure a lot of you

518
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,080
are there is not used for this because

519
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,000
what we propose is exactly that

520
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,880
institution put money in consolidate a

521
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,000
code that by being open source can be

522
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,240
grabbed and of course i don't need to

523
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,720
explain you that can you can be grabbed

524
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,600
and used for many many other uh

525
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,880
situation and this is this big inversion

526
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,760
uh

527
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,280
should go to

528
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,039
a very distributed talent not too big

529
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,200
conglomerate you

530
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,960
while i'm explaining this the

531
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,559
catalonia is renewing all is digital

532
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,080
technology

533
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,760
is elicitation of uh

534
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,000
i think i'm not sure

535
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,159
if you are recording i am a bit afraid

536
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,400
of saying numbers and then be sued but

537
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,600
uh

538
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,280
a big number let's say 6-0 and then

539
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,760
before the six zero i would say

540
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,200
other three more zero right

541
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,919
to digitalize in the next

542
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,280
between two and six years no more

543
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,240
again all catalonia and this is not

544
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,840
split in

545
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,720
in loads smaller than the smallest i

546
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,679
think

547
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,799
is around

548
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,039
60 millions

549
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,880
and

550
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,799
you cannot reach it i suppose because

551
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,480
you have to be a real ability enough to

552
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,280
if something go wrong to give back 60

553
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,120
million so i'm

554
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,000
sure that most of you cannot

555
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,440
compete there

556
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,760
and so by seeing this because we have a

557
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,240
prototype we have a prototype that works

558
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,559
we have school that wanting it a

559
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,880
prototype with the sovereignty uh of the

560
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,760
crowd education in the center everybody

561
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,159
can audit control et cetera et cetera

562
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,360
using open source everybody happy

563
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,559
but

564
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,760
to reply if they block us if the

565
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,640
institution doesn't want to put money in

566
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,880
this it's very difficult that we can

567
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,360
compete with the other model right

568
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,919
and uh and we don't want to beat the

569
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,400
other model by prohibition we just want

570
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
to beat it because

571
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,640
slowly but surely people start

572
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,480
understanding that privacy is as

573
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,559
important and freedom of speech you can

574
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,960
or you can decide you to never use it

575
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,360
but the one day that you need it you

576
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,640
need it to be in to everything sure

577
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,440
so

578
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,720
to end up i just

579
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,200
want to say that this graphics so so

580
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,919
seeing that was very difficult to

581
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,480
involve all the digital talent and

582
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,760
capacity

583
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,000
to build this other alternative with

584
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,480
sovereignty in the center because the

585
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,159
money doesn't reach

586
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,400
the small unit like you are your

587
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,360
expertise your great expertise uh et

588
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
cetera et cetera so we start studying

589
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,720
and seeing if

590
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,559
and i'm sorry for the people that they

591
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,440
are not here from the eu because our

592
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,640
study is related to the european union

593
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
but i hope this could

594
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,960
be useful for you to repea reproduce in

595
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,279
your context but the study is on the

596
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,799
european union

597
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,799
so so we we thought that uh the european

598
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,080
union was pro-monopole i mean

599
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,279
it is from monopoly monopolies but uh

600
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,640
the legislation there was craft in a way

601
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,400
to make this very difficult and we

602
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,960
discovered that not at all

603
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,640
that in europe you have to know that the

604
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,360
legislation protect us

605
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,600
the citizen in order that

606
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,559
small unit could be part of these big

607
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,760
budgets

608
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,320
so if it's not europe we thought oh my

609
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,880
god so then it's spain

610
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,039
but it is not spain

611
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,240
it is not spain because uh

612
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,520
the the regulation on how to prepare

613
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,279
legislation coming from this um

614
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,080
uh directive european directive

615
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,039
um

616
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,480
it's good

617
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,600
also permit participation in fact those

618
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,799
regulations not only the european

619
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,440
regulation not only permit

620
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,640
small and medium and very small

621
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,919
micro enterprise to participate but it

622
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,919
is compulsory so our governments should

623
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,240
split

624
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,200
all the elicitation in very very small

625
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,240
lots

626
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,480
in order so that it can be more

627
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,760
distributed

628
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,640
but

629
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,120
this is are the graphics from the from

630
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,279
the you so i'm it's not from some

631
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,000
radical activist these are the graphics

632
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,320
showing the situation in europe

633
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,679
basically

634
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,480
no

635
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,279
country reached the the 50

636
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,320
of small and medium enterprise

637
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,360
uh

638
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,840
participation in

639
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,559
in any this is not only in digital

640
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,320
and uh

641
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,600
so

642
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,640
we are in our right

643
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,159
to complain

644
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,080
to start pushing institution in order

645
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,840
that they change their elicitation

646
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,640
because i even think that we could go

647
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,279
through some tribunal to try to shift

648
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,360
this situation i just say this because

649
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,760
we need all your talent

650
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,480
involved in democratic digitalization

651
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,320
because the digitalization that is going

652
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,039
on

653
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,799
will not be democratic this is the

654
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,000
situation

655
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,760
uh shared by by our camera the from the

656
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,320
corporate europe and um and lobby

657
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,640
control very nice people

658
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,120
working on analyzing uh

659
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
all this we are part of the network with

660
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,760
them also and this is

661
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,760
the situation the actual situation on

662
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,360
digitalization

663
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,440
these are the meeting

664
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,760
of the european commission

665
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,200
as you can see

666
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
the people defending the digital right

667
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,440
are not the

668
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,559
the major

669
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,679
um interlocutors um

670
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,799
uh

671
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,360
stakeholders for

672
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,000
for this business for this uh matter for

673
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,600
the european commission and uh

674
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,919
the situation is a situation of a huge

675
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,360
dependency

676
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,640
on non-sovereign solutions

677
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,960
uh and uh

678
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,000
i think

679
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,039
we there is the condition for all of us

680
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,880
to

681
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,520
ask for the right and to grab the right

682
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,440
and to

683
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,799
and to be part of the digitalization

684
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,880
of the institution and essential

685
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,600
services that is going on

686
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,520
and that we need to have this

687
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,679
information they just passed to you in

688
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,760
order to defend our position and slowly

689
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,679
but truly occupying

690
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,120
those spaces so that the

691
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,880
digitalization the the

692
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,279
digital transition as they call it

693
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,640
because they just

694
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,760
arrived

695
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,039
uh is happening in a democratic and

696
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,559
sovereign way sovereign for us

697
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,320

um if there is any question again you

703
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,679
can write that in the q a here in slack

704
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,399
we're going to take a look and uh and

705

share those with us uh while we wait for

709
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,039
people again first and foremost thank

710
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,399
you very much i mean your research is

711
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,320
always very interesting and that's one

712
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,600
of the reasons why we also wanted to

713
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,159
have you here we feel like again

714
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,559
security but also you know privacy it's

715
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,720
a big part of who we are and and

716
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,120
although definitely we do specify we do

717
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,520
go very specific in cyber security we

718
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
also have uh you know a

719
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,880
high for

720
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,200
everything that comes down to uh privacy

721
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,919
open source and we also feel like it's

722
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,600
very um actual uh especially after the

723
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,320
pandemic the the topic of digitalization

724
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,000
of institutions and we do share you know

725
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,679
the division that you have that it's

726
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,360
something is a process that has to be

727
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,200
done needs to be done more carefully

728
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,440
that has been done

729
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,120
in the past

730
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,799
yes i sorry sorry i interrupted you

731
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,200
because i didn't speak about privacy at

732
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,640
all uh

733
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,399
because i i know that you yeah

734
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,279
this crowd is a crowd that is of privacy

735
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,600
and digital right defenders but of

736
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,399
course the core of what i'm saying is

737
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,440
about defending our basic right but

738
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,360
i didn't enter because you know even

739
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,399
more than me how all this is about no

740
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,240
absolutely no absolutely again we do

741
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,080
believe that privacy is one of those

742
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,000
right fundamental rights and especially

743
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,399
i was very struck about the percentage

744
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,720
one of the few slides that you showed us

745
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,880
that basically said 92

746
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,000
of you know all data is in the u.s

747
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,960
uh i know this quite a lot but

748
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,399
i was just even thinking about the

749
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,640
percentage of people using internet we

750
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,000
should be more or less the same between

751
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,480
europe and and us but that our data is

752
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,640
over there um

753
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,480
so let's see if there is any question

754
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,240
over there uh let's give me one second

755
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,720
oh yeah okay no it's just someone who

756
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,480
basically thanks you for you know

757
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
sharing this information and basically

758
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,960
putting the point on how important it is

759
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,200
to you know have data sovereignty

760
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,399
actually

761
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,360
um

762
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,440
i don't know i do have a question though

763
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,520
i mean so we have some more time for

764
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,559
people to to come up with some questions

765
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,760
and i think he starts back to the at the

766
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,159
beginning whereas your presentation when

767
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,480
you think when you were mentioning about

768
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,720
the policy makers that

769
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,480
basically they don't know better right

770
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,760
they don't know how to do they don't

771
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,600
know how what they are doing basically

772
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,080
and what they are doing um do you feel

773
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,600
that perhaps these issues that we are

774
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,440
having these contrasts we are having

775
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,559
comes from

776
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,399
stem from the fact that

777
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,519
perhaps those policy makers they are

778
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,080
how can i say born outside of the

779
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,919
digital revolution and they are actually

780
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,399
seen as an external actor rather than

781
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,360
for example people of a different

782
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,440
i guess generation or age that actually

783
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,640
are more

784
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,360
into technology and and

785
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,279
in general digital do you think that it

786
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,440
could be one of the reason or no they

787
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,919
are born out of the world so there is no

788
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,519
no any

789
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,159
there is no it's not the sector real is

790
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,320
not no but

791
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,559
you know i really believe very much on

792
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,440
what mr sturgeon was saying that

793
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,039
the 90 of everything is junk

794
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,480
so uh and this is for me the only law i

795
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,120
really believe in is this one the

796
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,880
sturgeon law ninety percent of

797
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,799
everything is junk so

798
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,679
uh

799
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,880
uh i'm sure that this ten percent of

800
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,039
good policy maker

801
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,480
will permit me to say that uh which are

802
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,880
very good people struggling

803
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,760
that the 90 of so that policy making

804
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,840
especially now because it's based on a

805
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,960
structure that is pre-digital as a

806
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,559
structure so the political party behave

807
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,039
still if their mediation would never

808
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,080
happen

809
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,840
so before we need

810
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,240
our representatives to go inside of the

811
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
parliament and then they come out and

812
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,799
they tell us what was happening inside

813
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,039
but now with the camera we can say see

814
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,240
it all day so they they still

815
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,200
behave like political party were never

816
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,159
been disintermediate like the media like

817
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,360
like uh the the creative uh

818
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,159
uh

819
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,080
industry

820
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,240
they are just protecting a status quo

821
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,440
which is the monopole of the power

822
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,480
between

823
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,279
uh

824
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,240
their to be the intermediary between

825
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,880
us the people and the mechanism of

826
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,200
governance but they are wrong because

827
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,960
they are they are just so they are just

828
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,519
defending their place so i am speaking

829
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,679
with politicians since 40 years and

830
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,600
except this 10 percent what you find in

831
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,480
front of

832
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,720
yourself is someone that doesn't want to

833
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,519
move is someone scared of everything

834
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,559
because if every moves something could

835
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,000
change and somebody could get annoyed so

836
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,480
um the the governance structure that we

837
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,240
have up till now is a structure that

838
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,399
bring us to fascism because in a

839
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,159
situation of very

840
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,039
uh big economical difficulties

841
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,480
uh to not fixing things it just bring

842
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,200
people to get desperate and taking

843
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,720
extreme desperate solutions so this is

844
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
why it's so important that

845
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,880
us the people that we have

846
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,279
i myself have learned many of you have

847
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,200
born like this that you understand what

848
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,840
is this intermediation what is

849
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,399
a fast communication in a network what

850
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,720
is a forking by

851
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
by keeping an eye on another what

852
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,840
another node does but without needing to

853
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,399
be all together everywhere all the time

854
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,760
but we can cooperate in a fast

855
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,679
agile way

856
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,000
we try to transfer

857
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,320
this way of governance in all the spaces

858
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,280
of governments we have from our families

859
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,520
to the school to wherever to our

860
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,719
workplace

861
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,879
to our

862
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,199
hobbies or whatever we do

863
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,399
because it's a matter of

864
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,960
the future democracy which only can be a

865
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,119
network democracy

866
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,839
copying the structure of the internet or

867
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,079
fascism so i don't think that we have

868
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,200
