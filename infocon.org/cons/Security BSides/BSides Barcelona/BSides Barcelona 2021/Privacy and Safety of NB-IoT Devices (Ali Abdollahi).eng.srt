1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,799
okay

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,120
so

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,559
uh

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,840
hello everybody and uh thank you

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,519
uh for your time and this is ali and uh

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,080
i really happy to be here at great

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
besides barcelona conference

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,199
and today i'm gonna talking about uh

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,240
some aspects security aspects of

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,039
uh

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,760
internet of things especially narrowband

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,199
internet of things

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,360
uh based on

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,680
llc communication

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,800
so i think

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,879
it is interesting for you and uh

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,640
so let me

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,239
going to slide show

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,520
okay

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,840
so

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,480
first of all this is ali and uh as

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,120
mentioned before i i have almost nine

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,039
years of experience

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,720
different variety of security fields

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,159
and also i'm a regular inspector and

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,600
trainer at many international

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,280
conferences and real i really love to

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
play with beats and bias and signal and

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,040
radio and uh before start let me switch

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,400
to shows automatic show

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,400
okay

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,400
uh

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,960
what is in terms of things maybe most of

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,400
you heard about there are some uh

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,280
special components of internet of things

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,560
uh like uh some hardware they're acting

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,600
as sensors uh and also there are some

38
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,640
medievars and apis maybe

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
and there there are some gateways

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,240
as well as some integration

41
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,520
with the web application and

42
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,079
maybe mobile application

43
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,960
uh for management purposes

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,720
and uh another thing is that uh

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,800
we may hear about internet of things and

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
uh such a technologies in different

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,239
uh businesses and purposes like

48
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
industrial internet of things which is

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,840
very uh interesting nowadays uh the

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,000
second one then one of the most critical

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
one is healthcare in healthcare um

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,000
actually healthcare industry uh taking

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,560
advantage of internet of things as well

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,959
as uh all kind of mobile communication

55
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,040
and uh actually telecom based

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,319
infrastructure

57
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,599
uh

58
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,720
actually for uh connectivity for better

59
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,680
uh connection speed and the less

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,840
delay and

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,360
latency and there are many medical

62
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,840
devices and sensors all around the world

63
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,360
acting as uh internet of things a sensor

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,239
and

65
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,280
um the main advantage of internet of

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,159
thing is that connecting every sensors

67
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,879
every hardware and software together

68
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,519
with a great and portable and flexible

69
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,959
management

70
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,599
so the next one is smart city

71
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,480
uh

72
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,239
so

73
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,400
different uh sections

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,280
uh

75
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,560
playing uh critical roles uh in smart

76
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,519
city

77
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,920
and uh most of connection is based on

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,480
internet of things and also smart home

79
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,840
maybe you're facing with a smart home

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,040
technologies they're taking advantage of

81
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,879
internet of things as well

82
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,200
and other uh relative industries like

83
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,080
agriculture

84
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,239
uh so

85
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,560
there are many solutions uh actually uh

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,040
working in agriculture based on internet

87
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,879
of things and nb iot and narrowband

88
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
internet of things as well so for

89
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,840
example uh if we want to detect fire we

90
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,280
can take advantage of internet of things

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,000
technologies or even uh have better

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,400
actually uh performance uh and less uh

93
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,959
water wasting we can take advantage of

94
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,360
internet of things and nba iot in

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,640
agriculture industry as well

96
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,920
so

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,759
uh

98
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,360
actually uh i want to uh go deeper

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,840
inside narrowband internet of things so

100
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,120
first of all i want to talk about uh

101
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,160
another aspect called ltm

102
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,040
or

103
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
actually

104
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,600
lte machine type communication or ltmtc

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
uh it's based on

106
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,479
even technology

107
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,759
developed by the international standards

108
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,919
organization 2gpp

109
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,960
and it's enabled all kind of hardware

110
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,440
and sensors devices

111
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,199
and equipment in the field of internet

112
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
of things and related services for iot

113
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,199
service and applications

114
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,639
so

115
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,520
actually uh ltm

116
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,600
uh

117
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,400
allows the reuse of lc installed based

118
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,720
on a great coverage

119
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,000
and uh

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,639
what is nvit as i said before it's

121
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,759
narrowband iot it's a radio based

122
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,039
technology

123
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,000
uh with set up over

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
cellular communication which is uh

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
specially

126
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,039
uh

127
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,199
prepared for indoor

128
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,039
coverage a long battery life

129
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,479
a great volume of equipment uh user

130
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,000
equipments and devices with a low cost

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,160
of uh deployments actually uh nbit

132
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,840
limits bandwidths uh to a single

133
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,960
narrow band of approximately 200

134
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,880
kilohertz uh

135
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,840
and offering get greater speeds of uh

136
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,960
actually

137
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,840
26 kilobytes in a really in

138
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,680
13 release of the international standard

139
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,600
3gpp

140
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,400
and there are some other uh

141
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,520
version of

142
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,600
mbiot developed by 3gpp also

143
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,840
and

144
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,600
actually uh

145
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,000
ltm and nbiot are together and their uh

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,240
complementary solutions

147
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,520
so

148
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,680
[Music]

149
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
scientists and researchers think about

150
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,160
that uh internet of thing is very useful

151
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,240
for different kind of industry people

152
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,479
and experts all around the world so what

153
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,479
is the better uh

154
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,960
solution to take advantage of this great

155
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,560
technology so

156
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,639
actually the main issue in internet of

157
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,720
things is the infrastructure and the

158
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
network connection

159
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,880
so what is the best network connectivity

160
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,199
all around the world with the greatest

161
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,400
uh coverage and less latency and delay

162
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,680
with low cost so absolutely there it is

163
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,599
uh cellular based communication or

164
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,680
mobile network communication

165
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,039
so

166
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,720
companies and uh

167
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,440
international organization try to

168
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,560
integrate

169
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,960
internet of things with cellular

170
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,680
communication and it is

171
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,400
right now it is mbiot it's based on a

172
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
cellular communication especially in

173
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,120
fourth generation in lte

174
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,240
and it's

175
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,120
actually taking advantage of uh

176
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,759
radio section or radio access network in

177
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,560
lte which is called eu trend evolved

178
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,599
utran

179
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,199
and uh

180
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,479
there are many uh advantage uh between

181
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,039
nb iot and iot because

182
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,319
we have more

183
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,759
speed more security feature uh however

184
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,479
in this slot in this presentation i'm

185
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,199
going to talk about more about some

186
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,919
issues regarding nb iot especially as i

187
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,280
mentioned before because the

188
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,440
infrastructure is based on lte

189
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,800
communication and radio based

190
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,560
communication in lt

191
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,759
generation

192
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,960
uh we're going deep to uh

193
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,400
review how a hacker and antaker

194
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
would take advantage of

195
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,840
some issues

196
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,160
to exploit and

197
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,840
what kind of vulnerabilities are in

198
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,318
place in this industry

199
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,919
so first of all i'm going uh

200
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,800
to have a little introduction about our

201
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,640
privacy in lte communication

202
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,000
actually

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
uh

204
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,760
um so

205
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,480
and to be honest uh most of mobile

206
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,880
operators use uh some kind of dedicated

207
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,600
spectrum bands uh uh under provision of

208
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,839
license granted by their for example

209
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,160
national regulator or other organization

210
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,440
so m or mobile network operator uh

211
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,240
provide connectivity using a standard

212
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,519
network technologies like umps gsm and

213
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,519
lte and 5g

214
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,200
nowadays as specified by some

215
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,640
global organization like 3gpp

216
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,240
the two major uh mobile iot technologies

217
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
ltm and narrowband iots standards by

218
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,640
3gpp

219
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,440
uh

220
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,600
are funded by large number of mobile

221
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,800
operator and supplier of equipment

222
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
actually

223
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,880
allowing the ecosystem

224
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,839
to benefit from economic upscale and low

225
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,720
cost of development and deployment

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,120
you know and the security specification

227
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,040
of narrowband internet of things are

228
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,880
close to

229
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,839
those of standard

230
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,680
standards in iot

231
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,480
but

232
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,279
there are several variations uh

233
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,160
primarily with regard to low energy iot

234
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,560
hardware network connectivity

235
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,760
etc

236
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,640
and the iot terminal device typically

237
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,519
has powerful processing capacity and the

238
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,160
complex network communication protocol

239
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,040
and a

240
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,680
higher security reinforcement strategy

241
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,240
and typically power consumption is high

242
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,880
and regular charging is important

243
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,000
and low cover iot system on the other

244
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
hand are distinguished by uh

245
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,600
actually

246
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,320
vulnerabilities are more likely to pose

247
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,880
a threat to terminals

248
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,920
in addition um actually the state of

249
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,240
denial of service

250
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,040
denial of service attacks may be

251
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,839
triggered by basic resource use

252
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
in comparison

253
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
actually the number of low power

254
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,480
consumption iot terminal system i'm in

255
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,680
is much higher in real implementation

256
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,839
than in

257
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,160
conventional iot internet of things

258
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,519
devices

259
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,040
so uh

260
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,519
actually even greater security

261
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,440
will result from some minor security

262
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,560
risks and uh india iot is centralized

263
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,360
systems such as lte where uh basis

264
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,279
station actually we called base station

265
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,959
in lte we called in e-node b manage both

266
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,320
uh uplink and downlink scheduling um to

267
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,880
ensure the synchronization of resources

268
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,120
between systems

269
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,320
uh and as you can see uh

270
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,399
billion of connected devices can and

271
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,320
subscribers user user equipment uh

272
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,360
connecting to the basic station to take

273
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,160
advantage of uh lt infrastructure and

274
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,040
they are acting as anviolitis sensors

275
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,880
and so

276
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,720
to be concluded actually this

277
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
infrastructure

278
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,279
is

279
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,959
some kind of critical infrastructure in

280
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,680
portrayal industry

281
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,839
so

282
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,440
actually

283
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
here we have example but before that i

284
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,399
want to a little uh

285
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,040
talk about the example and this security

286
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,120
aspect in this slide

287
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
so

288
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,959
um

289
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,519
actually uh searchers can

290
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,560
impersonate cell phone users by uh as

291
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,800
you know leveraging a flaw in the mobile

292
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,519
communication protocol in lte or maybe

293
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,720
in traditional technologies like ss7 uh

294
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,760
in past

295
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,480
generations like gsm and 3g therefore

296
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,720
through the cell phone bill uh they will

297
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,440
look fee-based service under their name

298
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,000
and are paid for for example an attacker

299
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,200
may book facilities stream screens but

300
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,279
the owner of the attack phone would have

301
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,519
to pay for them you know uh

302
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,040
actually

303
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,680
there are some other kind of tanks uh

304
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,600
regarding uh

305
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,839
the

306
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,160
infrastructure the telecom

307
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,480
infrastructures

308
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,880
is draw in denial of service

309
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,680
uh

310
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,360
actual location tracking etc

311
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,600
so and now in this case due to the

312
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,440
existing of vulnerabilities and

313
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,160
extensive security of actual privacy

314
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,720
security uh and design authentication

315
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,800
processes in mobile networks

316
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,440
so the design uh

317
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,519
actually the design and implementation

318
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,079
of these algorithms in the third and

319
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,279
fourth generation lte uh has been

320
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,040
greatly improved

321
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,480
than gsm technology

322
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,760
so

323
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,399
uh actually there is an advanced

324
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,480
mutual authentication mechanism and

325
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,480
encryption as well in lte network and

326
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,720
this has reduced security risk but it

327
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,800
should be noted that security concerns

328
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,480
uh actually have not yet been fully

329
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,519
addressed

330
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,959
and reasons for this include the

331
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,560
vulnerability of this technology to

332
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
attacks such as

333
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,360
as i said location tracking fake bts and

334
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,519
lte fake enough b implementation or

335
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,839
rogue it would be using protocol

336
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,519
exploitation and based on the research

337
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,720
and experiment performed uh as uh based

338
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,399
on this example

339
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,959
uh actually uh

340
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,720
on a it's it's somehow a real network or

341
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,040
in a test bed it's possible to perform

342
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,240
this kind of

343
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,279
research and experiment uh

344
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,600
actually which performed in lte protocol

345
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,040
especially in access layer in

346
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,880
radioactive network

347
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,959
and

348
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,000
actually you can see uh you you i used a

349
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,880
radio capture in lte utran without any

350
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,000
special access to the network and in

351
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,399
this protocol uh despite security

352
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,839
mechanisms such as encryption and mutual

353
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,120
authentication is vulnerable to protocol

354
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,920
exploitation and set up a fake uh basis

355
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,279
station or regular node b uh an attacker

356
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,720
can use uh this to sniff on traffic with

357
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,199
a sim card or software defined radio for

358
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,880
sdr

359
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,040
so

360
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,639
actually a number of exploits are

361
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,240
found

362
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,440
and introduced based on open source

363
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,560
version of lts stack open lte as i

364
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,040
mentioned and mainly focused on the lts

365
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,720
stack open source implementation

366
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,199
analysis is actually given on the growth

367
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,440
of low cost indicator

368
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,920
and exploits that trigger blocking of

369
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,000
mobile devices which were first

370
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,680
introduced globally uh in many events

371
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,880
and uh

372
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,720
research communities

373
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,199
and so all traffic and data are

374
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
collected uh

375
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,759
and captured by a usrp b2010

376
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,199
and baseband by using uh these features

377
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,120
uh we will be able to capture and

378
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,199
analyze data in physical layer as you

379
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,240
can see based on the wireshark results

380
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,839
in this slide

381
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,000
such as are receiving real-time

382
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,480
information decoding the non-access

383
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,720
stratum uh

384
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,560
or steep oracle and system messages in

385
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,920
nlp

386
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,120
and the information gathered during

387
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,320
the research is collected from a real uh

388
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,199
uh

389
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,759
actually function which i emulated in

390
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,839
open source environments

391
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,920
and the sniffer system acted as enzy

392
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,000
catcher in this research and capture the

393
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,920
emc number which is the most valuable

394
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,000
information and it is unique for every

395
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,240
mobile subscriber all around the world

396
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,199
so

397
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,160
uh

398
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,320
it's something like a

399
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,759
static

400
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,160
ip address which is unique for you so

401
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,000
this is important for a hacker or

402
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,120
attacker to have your static and

403
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,240
permanent address so amz is acting like

404
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,040
that so it is very important and

405
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,680
actually we capture the emcee of active

406
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,240
subscribers or maybe emulated

407
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,040
subscribers in the area and the the

408
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,000
analysis was performed with open lt

409
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,360
uh an srs lt as well software in order

410
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,000
to listen to traffic and implement you

411
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,039
know to be

412
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,559
uh

413
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,839
actually in emulation environment

414
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,199
and all that exchange between the user

415
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,559
equipment

416
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,119
i mean that the mobile phone and the

417
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,880
basis station is intercepted but only

418
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,079
actually

419
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
control plane traffic actually that

420
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,640
includes signaling data is important to

421
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,079
us

422
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,760
and this section examines the

423
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,840
exploitation of the lt protocol using

424
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,840
the analysis of the collected signaling

425
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,480
data and a number of security aspects

426
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,360
and abuse of lt protocol uh

427
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,200
mentioned before and the most uh

428
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,080
spotlight of which that are extraction

429
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,840
of information from mib and sib messages

430
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,000
and the denial of service attack for the

431
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
os and location tracking using the

432
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,160
implementation of rogue inaudible

433
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,000
and this um

434
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,640
simplifies the user equipment's initial

435
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,480
access protocol and uh so but it could

436
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,640
potentially be leveraged by an attacker

437
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,960
to create for example sophisticated

438
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,600
jamming attacks customize configuration

439
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,320
of arugula base station or attuning

440
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,799
other sophisticated attack and complex

441
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,720
attacking scenarios

442
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,039
so based on the

443
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,320
pictures here uh

444
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,320
there are some contents of my

445
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,360
sib messages in voice are transmitted by

446
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,799
a commercial enough to be uh in my test

447
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,039
area from the information extracted from

448
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,480
these messages and then seeker can

449
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,160
discover the mobile operator that

450
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,400
operates that cell the tracking area

451
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,720
code received power threshold to trigger

452
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,600
a handoff and adjust cell and a series

453
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
of configuration data could be

454
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,760
influenced to set up a fake base station

455
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,600
so and one of the most valuable segments

456
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,919
of information from the protocol exploit

457
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,720
point of view uh actually is the list of

458
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,400
uh high priority

459
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,600
frequencies

460
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,080
uh these parameters can be configured on

461
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,240
a regular you know db it activate most

462
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,440
user equipment and mobile phones to

463
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,799
attach to

464
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,760
that malicious base station in addition

465
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
an attacker can also extract mapping of

466
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,840
important control channels on a physical

467
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,880
layer from the sib messages and this can

468
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,720
be leveraged can we configure a smart

469
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,760
jammer so and also open lc provides a

470
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,840
traffic lock feature can be executed to

471
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,760
pass it with scan broadcast information

472
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,559
from the nearby base station a low cost

473
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,360
alternative can be implemented on rtl

474
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,400
str

475
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
radio running

476
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,360
the lte cell scanner tools

477
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,120
so

478
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,320
actually uh based on pictures

479
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,679
neighbor cells that successfully

480
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,919
detected by tool and the decoded

481
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,120
information of both mib and sib messages

482
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,840
can be shown here

483
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,440
and uh here

484
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,039
tmz capture

485
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:03,840
and

486
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
actually in order to implement and

487
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,480
exploit this attack uh it is necessary

488
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,280
to capture subscriber nz on air

489
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,559
uh so interesting the point here is that

490
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,679
that a low volume of emzy values is

491
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,000
exchanged between user equipments and

492
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,840
the network due to its very high

493
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,559
importance

494
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,879
as i mentioned before uh

495
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,720
mcnumber

496
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,679
and sometimes this exchange

497
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,960
supervisors under some situations as a

498
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,880
when descending attach network as you

499
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,200
can see here at that stage actually

500
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,760
mobile phone uh or user equipment sends

501
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,960
the mz

502
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,360
uh before authentication and nas

503
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,919
protocol which handling authentication

504
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,559
and other related procedures

505
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,720
and now the attacker disconnect the

506
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,039
subscriber and implement arugula noteb

507
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,799
or fake one so that all subscribers in

508
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,440
that specific area to send their emc

509
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,120
number toward the attack station so

510
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,919
uh it's that's great eric inaudible is a

511
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,159
fake base station that is illegally set

512
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,600
up uh on the lt network and operated by

513
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,240
a hacker or an attacker by a

514
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,880
open source software framework uh which

515
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,120
are widely available on the internet and

516
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,679
based on the picture uh simple

517
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,840
subscriber attach request in wireshark

518
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,240
uh can be seen and the subscriber has

519
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,120
sent attach request message along with a

520
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,559
related clear text mz number

521
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,559
uh to authenticate and complete the

522
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,120
connection process to the network so if

523
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,720
arugula node b

524
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,799
has been set up with a required inode

525
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,679
network promoter the attacker can now

526
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,400
launch a potential serious threat such

527
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,480
as man in the middle attacks denial of

528
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,679
service analysis messages or inject as

529
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,320
some kind of malicious messages to the

530
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,799
attachment process or deny user

531
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,440
equipment mobile service and downgrade

532
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,799
to a non-lte network so this

533
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,679
the mbiology sensor will then downgrade

534
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,480
to a

535
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,720
non-lte like umtsn 2g which is a great

536
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,360
environment for a hacker moreover denial

537
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,520
of service attack uh actually that may

538
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
lead to network failure or downgrading

539
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,440
to non-healthy a network or

540
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,320
refusing all left for access

541
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,520
so

542
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,640
okay

543
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,840
i'm going

544
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,600
more fast

545
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,440
and the exploitation

546
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,480
actually

547
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,400
uh based on my previous uh explanation

548
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,799
here uh is another exploitation it's

549
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,280
some kind of active exploitation and the

550
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,679
hacker trying to actually play btau

551
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,720
or

552
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,440
traffic area update reject message which

553
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,000
require no security keys and the regular

554
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,320
you know we could target any lte mobile

555
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,360
user in its area for provisional denial

556
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,320
of service it doesn't matter it's a nvtr

557
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,880
nb iot sensor or a real subscriber you

558
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,679
know uh and a similar thread is also

559
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,919
possible for service reject or attach

560
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,919
which you reject require messages

561
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,640
actually or request on responses

562
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,480
in the network

563
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
uh whenever the

564
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,760
user equipment transmits a tau request

565
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,159
message to a regular node b it would be

566
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,480
still be actually associated to the real

567
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,320
network and this message is also

568
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,799
integrity protected but not encrypted

569
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,360
under the nas security context and this

570
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,840
will be a pretty uh an opportunity for

571
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,400
attacker who could easily decode and

572
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,120
send respond with a ta reject message

573
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,640
and

574
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,679
so

575
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,720
uh

576
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
and that does not require the integrity

577
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,320
enforcement as well

578
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,559
so actually based on the picture user

579
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,360
equipment and nbit sensor actually will

580
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,840
accept the reject cause and continue to

581
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,400
act further by deleting all existing

582
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,039
service connected to the actual network

583
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,559
and in addition tiu statutory requests

584
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,000
will not be searched for uh

585
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,799
for or sent by the user equipment or

586
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,679
sensor to any nearby legitimate lte

587
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,480
network uh causing temporary denial of

588
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,120
service uh with less effect

589
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,600
and uh as you can see

590
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,240
some other kind of similar attacks and

591
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,799
vulnerability are possible in lte

592
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,799
network and right now due to lack of

593
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,679
time

594
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,960
uh

595
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,480
i should

596
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,679
go into conclusion and uh i think my

597
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,080
time is over right now and thank you

598
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,480
everybody uh for your time thank you

599
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,600
besides uh have a nice day if there is

600
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,000
any question i'm here to answer

601
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,520
questions thank you

602
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,120
yeah thanks ali

603
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,039
uh yeah let's wait uh

604
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,240
a little bit over time let's wait a

605
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
couple of minutes it's someone from the

606
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,600
audience here in zoom or someone in the

607
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,080
youtube channel wants to write us a

608
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,039
question

609
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,240
um i have a question actually um

610
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,400
again this is not my expertise

611
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
so it was really interesting and i know

612
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,880
that it's a huge like there is a word

613
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,720
right behind it

614
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,240
but then a question

615
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,120
is it possible would it be possible to

616
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,840
apologize to

617
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,600
um they take an i i s an imc

618
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,520
catcher

619
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
and it would be possible i mean me as a

620
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,000
user of a device could i have like a nap

621
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,919
or something that say hey so i mean be

622
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,679
careful that someone is catching these

623
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,559
things

624
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,400
is it possible

625
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,279
yes actually uh there are many incidents

626
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,760
uh on the news that

627
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,640
maybe

628
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,520
uh

629
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,000
some organization found easy catcher

630
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,840
devices because there are many

631
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,000
commercial indicator devices all around

632
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,279
the world

633
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,159
and for different purposes but it is

634
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,120
possible to build and run your own inc

635
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,000
catcher based on open source tools and

636
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,559
you need some kind of a platform and uh

637
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,360
to actually emulate this stack like open

638
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,720
lte srslt and uh software defined radio

639
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
like usrp

640
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,320
or blade rf hack rf or rtl str uh

641
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,200
whenever you want to focus on a specific

642
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,320
uh cellular network generation it's

643
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,400
different to use uh

644
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,120
which one which kind of actually str you

645
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,279
want to use it's based on the

646
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,400
specification and your requirements and

647
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,279
on and on the user side or so let's say

648
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,640
uh i have like you know can i detect if

649
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,400
someone has created an nc capture i mean

650
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,799
do i know if someone is actually

651
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,200
it it's really it's it's really tough

652
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,120
because uh

653
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,320
we we as a subscriber normal subscribers

654
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,799
cannot detect the amc catcher or lugo

655
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,279
and not be in a different network

656
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,760
however mobile network owner and

657
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,640
operator all around the world uh

658
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,559
facing with this kind of issues they

659
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,080
cannot detect

660
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
such uh

661
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,360
issues and fake basis station but uh

662
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,399
some groups and also uh

663
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,279
me uh worked on some solutions to detect

664
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,159
the

665
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,200
fake stations based on some behavior

666
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,240
analysis and machine learning algorithms

667
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,039
uh to detect a fake base station in

668
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,799
earlier stages

669
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,960
okay oh that's awesome okay so we don't

670
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,120
have questions so far but i would love

671
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,919
if you can send these research documents

672
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,480
in the uh hallway chat uh in slack right

673
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,640
because i definitely want to zoom in and

674
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,760
look at the

675
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,720
data

676
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,120
um we don't have any question now here

677
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,600
so if someone has any questions you can

678
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,200
just go in slack

679
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,600
sagrada familia channel or the hallway

680
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,279
channel you can write those questions

681
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,960
there

682
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,640
ali and myself would be making sure that

683
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,240
those are addressed

684
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,960
um again thank you very much ali

685
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,360
and thanks for joining us it was really

686
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,918
interesting thank you
