1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,960
perfect wonderful

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,000
getting back to the right side

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,639
i think we're good

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,039
i think you're good to go i'm seeing the

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,080
kicks plus chips on the rtx 3080 right

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,439
there

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,760
okay perfect uh well we're about to

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,160
begin then

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,560
okay great hi everyone and welcome to

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,840
kicks and chips an investigation into

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,719
scalper bots

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,719
so hello

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,399
it's matthew

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,600
i am a subject matter expert at montego

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,239
i focus on matter analysis and as you

16
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,480
can probably tell by my accent i am

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,600
french but i live in barcelona

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
and i am liv rowley i am also a subject

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,320
matter expert at multigo my research

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,160
primarily focuses on cyber criminal

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,239
investigations primarily on the deep and

22
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,960
dark web and i am also barcelona based

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,400
so here is our agenda for today we're

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,640
going to start with a quick introduction

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,880
to scalperbots in general so just

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,400
everyone kind of has a baseline for what

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,920
we're talking about

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,040
next we're going to go into the

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,360
technical details about how these bots

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
actually work

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,799
after that we'll take a look at the bot

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,400
landscape so

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,079
questions such as pricing and where

34
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,840
they're being um sold

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,200
and then finally we'll wrap it up with

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,079
some key takeaways

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,720
so

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,799
why this talk well at the beginning of

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,600
this year i was looking to buy a graphic

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,159
card to build a gaming pc

41
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,720
however the lack of supply at the time

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
and the rise of demand provoked by

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,200
pandemic as well as the rise of bitcoin

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,920
prices made it a very interesting target

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,680
for scalpers

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,240
and i wasn't able to buy any gpu so on

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
the lower left of these slides you have

48
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,479
a quote from pcmac.com

49
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,320
talking about how the launch of the

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,000
geforce rtx 380 ones and how a good

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,959
portion

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,120
of the graphic cards were bought by

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,239
people using bots to buy them before

54
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,480
anyone else and then you resell them on

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,280
ebay and other websites so as you can

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,319
see the scalpers were reselling the gpus

57
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,800
at around three times retail price which

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,959
is quite a lot of money

59
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,280
so this is part of why we wanted to know

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,200
and learn what was going on with this

61
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,000
box

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
the bots that most people are probably

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,519
most familiar with are ticket scalper

64
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,239
bots um those have been around for a

65
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,319
long time they're kind of the og scalper

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,720
bot uh we found references to them all

67
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,959
the way back to 1999.

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
and here we have a graph showing google

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
trends results for searches for

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,920
ticket bot sneakerbot and gpu bot so you

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,239
can see the interest in ticketbot has

72
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,560
been the most enduring but there's been

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
significant increase in interest for all

74
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
these different bot types over the past

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,840
few years

76
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,440
one thing we think that is fueling that

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,239
is just general accessibility these

78
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,599
aren't that difficult to find these type

79
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,760
of bots anymore

80
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,560
for this investigation we surveyed 46

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
different bots primarily sneaker bots so

82
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
that's where a lot of the research that

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,200
we're going to present comes from

84
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959
and it's also to note that these bots

85
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,879
are operating in a legal

86
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,840
gray area um

87
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
there

88
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,159
there's not a lot of laws and

89
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,239
regulations that explicitly make this

90
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,319
activity illegal though it is often in

91
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,840
terms of service violation for the

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,400
retailers that they're targeting

93
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,560
but in the past few years or past

94
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,480
several years there has been definitely

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
an increase in government interest in

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,239
curtailing this activity

97
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,239
for instance in parts of the u.s ticket

98
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,920
bots are now illegal

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,799
and the eu has rolled out legislation

100
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,280
trying to curtail this activity

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,200
specifically around ticket bombing as

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,839
well

103
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,120
so what are the common targets of these

104
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,200
uh scalper bots

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,480
as we talked about tickets are

106
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,400
definitely a very

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,360
common

108
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,640
common target

109
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,760
also collectibles such as

110
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,238
trading cards and stuffed animals other

111
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,959
types of stuff that is maybe only

112
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,199
available in a limited quantity

113
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,720
sneakers is a big one this has been

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
talked about in the media for a couple

115
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,560
years now especially around exclusive or

116
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,240
limited releases

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,880
and as matt you mentioned before gpus

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
and other electronics such as uh the new

119
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,840
xbox and stuff like that

120
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,440
the images that we have on this slide

121
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
these have come from

122
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,919
quote success accounts so

123
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,000
oftentimes bot users will have either

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
twitter or instagram accounts where they

125
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,639
boast about their latest acquisitions so

126
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,160
that's where most of these photos here

127
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,240
have have come from is directly from bot

128
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
users bragging about what they've been

129
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,199
able to acquire

130
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,280
all right so

131
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
now that we have the general idea of

132
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,240
what snickerbots are we're going to take

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,840
a look at how they are

134
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,479
operated

135
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,080
so first of all i'm going to show you

136
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
really quickly the graphical user

137
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,039
interface of a scalpel bot

138
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,520
here you can see it is pretty user

139
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,800
friendly

140
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
a few bots are available in command line

141
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,960
interface but that's not the majority of

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,360
it most of them are for people that are

143
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,120
not obviously very technical you don't

144
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,280
need to be very technical to use one

145
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,960
as you can see you have different tabs

146
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,080
relating

147
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,320
to different kind of

148
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
aspects that you need to configure to

149
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,759
run properly is

150
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,960
capital bot

151
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,639
uh but the most important one is

152
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,639
probably the task all the way on the

153
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,639
left and it's something that you're

154
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,880
going to use to list different items

155
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,479
you're going to want to buy

156
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,440
and

157
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,039
try to purchase your thoughts

158
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,800
so

159
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
what's under the hood what technology do

160
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,479
these bots use

161
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,400
we don't really know for sure we

162
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,520
couldn't get our hands on one so we

163
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,639
surveyed the bots that are available on

164
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,440
github a lot of boards

165
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,400
were made last year to counter kind of

166
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,039
the professional paying bots

167
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,520
that were used by scalpers

168
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,039
so they were made by people who just

169
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,120
wanted to be able to to buy a gpu for

170
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,039
themselves because they were another way

171
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,960
to get one time maybe

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,039
so um both of them are available on

173
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,160
github following the line of fair game

174
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
that you have on the slide if everyone

175
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,000
is botting then no one is bought

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,880
so what do you have in using this box

177
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,639
you have the some brother mimicking

178
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,600
tools or at least driver that can

179
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,520
pilot pilots a browser such as selenium

180
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,039
because you need to be able to run

181
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,039
javascript you need to be able to fill

182
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,319
forms

183
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,759
simply using curl is not going to cut it

184
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,599
you also need to have some captcha

185
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
solving capabilities

186
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,000
such as death by capture that is going

187
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,520
to connect your app to a capture phone

188
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,599
somewhere with real human solving

189
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,960
captcha

190
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,759
or you have some automated libraries

191
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,240
such as amazon capture that is going to

192
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,120
automatically try to solve the captcha

193
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,360
uh then you need to be able to manage

194
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,840
cookies when doing requests uh to make

195
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,759
your part simply more human-like more

196
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,919
realistic that's why you have this uh

197
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,520
python package on screen

198
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,319
but

199
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,960
of course uh retailers have been trying

200
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,680
to find these bots because they are

201
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,400
in violation of the term of service

202
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
and we're going to take a little look at

203
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
what countermeasures were applied by

204
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,039
retailers so far

205
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,080
so we've seen retailers using cookies

206
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,479
this one's pretty trivial but pretty

207
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,319
efficient as well just simply using

208
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,639
cookies to track the bots across the

209
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,960
website and um

210
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,120
seeing what's their activity how they

211
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,360
evolve in the website and if their

212
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,960
behavior

213
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,599
matches the one other human

214
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,400
then uh retailers are also be checking

215
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
the delivery addresses

216
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,879
you cannot order 50 pair of shoes for

217
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,160
the same person

218
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,879
so if 50 pair of shoes are ordered

219
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,440
at the same address that seems pretty

220
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,879
sketchy to resellers a retailer sorry

221
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,800
then same thing happens for the ip

222
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,160
addresses and for the billing

223
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,639
information if the same debit card is

224
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,240
buying a

225
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,360
six

226
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,559
ps5 that seems also you know fishy

227
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,839
the last

228
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,519
iteration of discounted measures is

229
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,360
actually the raffle system

230
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,599
so the point of the bots is that they

231
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,440
fill forms very fast and they're going

232
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,920
to order very fast faster than any human

233
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,880
could

234
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,640
so the raffle system is you let anyone

235
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,040
wanting to buy this item enter their

236
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,440
billing information and their delivery

237
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,959
information

238
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,399
and enter kind of a raffle contest

239
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,680
and then

240
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,160
after two to five minutes plenty of time

241
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,640
for the bots to subscribe to contest but

242
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,200
also for real human to subscribe you're

243
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,320
going to

244
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,600
pick

245
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,959
a happy few

246
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,360
a certain number of winners that will be

247
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,560
awarded the right to buy the actual item

248
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,279
so this kind of negates the point of the

249
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,160
bot which is to be to fill forms very

250
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,040
fast

251
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,600
so that was kind of a response by the

252
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,920
seller

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,120
of course

254
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,320
the bots

255
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,240
went then on to counter the counter

256
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,080
measures and that's what we're going to

257
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,440
see next

258
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,399
um

259
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,120
so the first action they did was some

260
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,880
things are very trivial for example

261
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,959
scrambling the delivery address

262
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,040
if you live on to market street

263
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,560
apartment number five

264
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,440
you can simply say that you live on uh

265
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,560
market street second apartment number

266
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,600
five or something like this and um

267
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,040
it's not going to be exactly the same

268
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,279
line so you would have to actually parse

269
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,519
the delivery address which is something

270
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,360
that can be quite difficult sometimes

271
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,839
another thing that they did to

272
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,600
circumvent the

273
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
cookie use is simply harvesting cookies

274
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,680
using different

275
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,800
proxies

276
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,279
so they have quite a bit of cookies when

277
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,399
they go directly in to buy the item they

278
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,839
already have some

279
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,240
fake history

280
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,320
attached to their app so they

281
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,959
look more human-like

282
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,959
something used to counter

283
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,640
the checking of the billing information

284
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,040
is simply the use of the actual credit

285
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,440
card so these services are legit

286
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,760
services that are just going to connect

287
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,240
a unique credit card number virtual

288
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
credit card number to your own credit or

289
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,760
debit card and this is seamless for the

290
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,000
retailer and retailer has no way of

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,959
knowing

292
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,839
that discrete cards are in reality all

293
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,720
tied to the same physical credit card

294
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,399
then to counter the raffle system

295
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,040
the way that the box found was simply

296
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
enter the

297
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,920
raffle a lot of time by buying accounts

298
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,600
so for example here you have a

299
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
screenshot of nike accounts that are on

300
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,240
sale on

301
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,880
the internet and from what we observed

302
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
it varies between

303
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,440
one dollar or two dollar per account so

304
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,399
for example if you already want to enter

305
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,640
a raffle 200 types you're already

306
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,160
flushing down the drain four hundred

307
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,560
dollars

308
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
and of course if you want to enter the

309
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,560
raffle with 200 different profiles

310
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,760
you need to have an ip address for each

311
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,480
of

312
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,880
this profile in a different one

313
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,120
so these are some different categories

314
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
of proxies we could find

315
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
underneath on the slide you have

316
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,519
different some logos of proxy providers

317
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,279
especially targeting uh snickerbots

318
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,120
so all of these are these different

319
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,360
categories which don't check them these

320
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
are things that are claimed by the proxy

321
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,959
providers

322
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,800
it's interesting to note however that

323
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,680
depending on the category that you want

324
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,920
you're going to pay differently so

325
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,800
residential proxies are priced by the

326
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,839
gigabit gigabyte sorry of data with a

327
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,760
rough estimate being

328
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,519
15 dollar per gigabyte and then isp and

329
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,320
data center proxies are price priced by

330
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,000
ieps so the price is ranging from 75

331
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,680
cents to all the way to three dollars so

332
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,560
if you want to enter with 200 accounts

333
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,639
you're paying 400 already for the

334
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,000
accounts then maybe 600 dollars for the

335
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,800
actual ips so it's already a thousand

336
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,959
dollars down the drain just to have some

337
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,119
more chance of buying the items

338
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,880
then um not something to circumvent a

339
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,279
countermeasure per se but

340
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,200
something essential to efficiently

341
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
running a good snicker but or even a

342
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,320
collectible but for that matter

343
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,200
are the cook groups so these are basic

344
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,839
communities that you pay to be a part of

345
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,519
these are usually private discords and

346
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,760
they give you tips on how to run your

347
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,639
bots they give you information on what

348
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,800
are the next drops coming so when are

349
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,200
the next item going to be on sale

350
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
and what is the url that you're going to

351
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,920
have to use to input in your browser and

352
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,480
also what is going to be the result

353
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,639
value of the item so you can decide if

354
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,279
it's worth your time or not

355
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,360
so we found different prices but there

356
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,040
are usually around

357
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,079
30 euro a month and the overwhelming

358
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,399
majority of the coup groups that we

359
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,240
found are us based

360
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,959
okay now let's talk about the bot

361
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,000
landscape quickly

362
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
so one thing we wanted to look into

363
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,519
immediately was the pricing of these

364
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,639
bots

365
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,880
we found that bots are often using a

366
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,480
subscription model so there is an

367
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,279
initial upfront one-time cost to to get

368
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,199
the bot and then there's an additional

369
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,839
monthly cost or perhaps a bi-annual cost

370
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,440
some type of subsequent fee in order to

371
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,920
maintain that access

372
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,000
we looked into the pricing of these uh

373
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,160
these two costs so the upfront cost and

374
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,000
the subscription cost

375
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,320
the initial payment is an average of

376
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,560
around 300 euro but that can range all

377
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,240
the way down from 100 euro up to 850 and

378
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,800
the monthly cost is about 30 euro

379
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,680
the minimum we saw was 8.50 and the max

380
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,560
is all the way up to 100.

381
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,800
as a note we adjusted these prices into

382
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
euro the majority of the bots that we

383
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
looked at had their prices listed in

384
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,079
dollars though some also had their

385
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,920
prices listed in pounds and euros as

386
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,720
well

387
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,560
which is interesting and could

388
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
potentially tell us some information

389
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,360
about where these bots are being

390
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,600
developed and who their users primarily

391
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,639
are

392
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,000
and another interesting thing that we

393
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,920
saw is that a lot of these bots are

394
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,399
often um sold out

395
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,040
or listed as sold out on their sites

396
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,959
one reason we think that they're often

397
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,120
listed as sold out is just in order to

398
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,199
keep the supply low

399
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,199
if you have a bunch of competitive

400
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,040
speaker bots uh

401
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,880
being out there in the wild they're

402
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,240
going to become less effective as they

403
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,480
compete against each other

404
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,959
and another reason

405
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,680
is to uh not draw attention from the

406
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,759
retailers that they're targeting so if

407
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,360
if you become the primary bot that's

408
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,440
targeting a particular retailer the

409
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
retailer will likely look into your bot

410
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,480
and find counter measures tailored to um

411
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,720
to to circumvent what your bot is doing

412
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,959
um

413
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,959
the exclusivity of this these bots have

414
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,800
led to some odd distortions in the

415
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,000
market here

416
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,839
uh one thing that jumped out to us as

417
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,040
strange was there's a resale market for

418
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,240
the bots

419
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,720
so we looked at a site called bop broker

420
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
in which people were reselling sneaker

421
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
bots and we have a little price graph

422
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,199
over here that shows in black the retail

423
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,800
price of the bot so when you just buy it

424
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,839
up front

425
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,560
and then in yellow the resell price on

426
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,160
bot broker so you can see it's

427
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,839
tremendously more expensive to get a

428
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,839
bought from bob broker

429
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,680
and we also saw that there were services

430
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,839
that allowed you to rent out a bot so

431
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,160
because they are so expensive it might

432
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,320
not be worth it for people to

433
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,800
pay 300 euro up front and 30 euro a

434
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
month to maintain access so you can just

435
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,040
rent out a bot for perhaps a day that

436
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,560
you know that important release is

437
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,560
happening

438
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,959
we were also curious about um the cyber

439
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,720
criminal element of this so whether

440
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,320
cyber criminals were looking at sneaker

441
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,839
bots as well

442
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,240
and uh here we have a multicograph in

443
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,920
which we were looking at cyber criminal

444
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,560
chatter on different forums

445
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,440
and uh we can see is three clusters of

446
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,680
information and those are the three main

447
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,040
forums where cyber criminals were

448
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,880
talking about sneaker bots so these are

449
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,720
all english language forms

450
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,480
we saw nold hack forms and crafts.t.o

451
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,319
and these guys were primarily talking

452
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,720
about uh cracked bots or bots that have

453
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
been reverse engineered and are now

454
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,520
being sold again

455
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,480
and as a profile we looked at this one

456
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,520
vendor called snkr bots they're active

457
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,679
on an english language underground form

458
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,919
and they sell access to a package of 11

459
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
different cracked sneaker bots

460
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,119
including

461
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,760
top secret tsb nsb soul etc

462
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,520
the cost of the service is an initial

463
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,919
price of uh 300 and a monthly cost of

464
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,559
30. which is interesting because i mean

465
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,080
we're talking dollar to euro here but

466
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,760
that's roughly what we saw as the price

467
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,039
for just one bot um commonly

468
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,799
so this is what we found on the

469
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,240
underground and we thought that was

470
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,200
quite interesting too

471
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,919
let's see

472
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,640
uh and then finally so our key takeaways

473
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
um the first one that we have is that

474
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
scalper botting has been around for

475
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,240
a long time as we said it's been around

476
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,720
since at least 1999

477
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,080
and another thing that we'd like to

478
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
point out is that it's been diversifying

479
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,160
so instead of just targeting tickets and

480
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
street wear it's also starting to target

481
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,120
electronics and other

482
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
other items as well

483
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,480
so the third takeaway we had is that

484
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,720
butters are bypassing countermeasures

485
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,000
using special specialized services such

486
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,360
as proxies and vccs

487
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,799
of course we're talking about the

488
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,679
countermeasures we saw since we got them

489
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,919
from

490
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
these butters the scalpers chatters and

491
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,400
communities maybe there are some others

492
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,240
that are used by retailers that we don't

493
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,160
know about but the one we know about

494
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,640
they are being circumvented

495
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,440
and the last one and a pretty ironic one

496
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,600
actually is that the exclusivity of

497
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,200
thoughts has led to a resale market

498
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,280
as well as a cracked underground market

499
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,400
so

500
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
with that we would like to thank you for

501
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,799
attending our presentation and we will

502
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,240
now be taking questions

503
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,480
thank you very much

504
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,960
uh that was interesting so i've got one

505
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,400
question uh

506
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,600
about

507
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,840
like

508
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,640
what is the main issue like for

509
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,080
companies and how like how interested

510
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,760
are the companies on fighting these

511
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,679
things like how

512
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,520
many resources they are spending on

513
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,679
these is this like a big issue for

514
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,919
companies because like the main

515
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,440
uh

516
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
like people who get like affected by

517
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
these are mainly consumers right but at

518
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,280
the end of the day the retailers like

519
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,880
they are selling the stuff right so it

520
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,200
could be like a branding issue uh or

521
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,880
something like that so i'm interested on

522
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,799
yeah like who is interested in fighting

523
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,799
this

524
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,559
okay so uh yeah it is very much of a

525
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,280
branding issue because it does not look

526
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,520
good for nike or for nvidia to

527
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,559
have every time they release a new gpu

528
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,360
to have a thousand of customers getting

529
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
very angry on forums and saying that

530
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,600
nvidia is the worst because

531
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,520
but about everything

532
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,679
so now if you

533
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,080
i mean these brands they are making

534
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
profits of course they are selling of

535
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,960
this

536
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,679
but uh at the end of the day

537
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,840
if they don't do anything against that

538
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,760
they are not really pleasing their

539
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,679
customers which is probably not a good

540
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,480
thing on the long term

541
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,679
um what resources do they have devoted

542
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,240
specifically to fight this uh we have no

543
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,720
idea we couldn't uh get any data on that

544
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,640
yeah i wonder like if they are like

545
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,280
specific teams just dedicated like full

546
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,159
time

547
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,480
on on fighting this but you know another

548
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,039
point that you made it something like a

549
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,960
lot of companies also like don't make

550
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,280
money on the hardware that they sell but

551
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,960
they do they make the money on the

552
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,320
services uh so if if they're like the

553
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,840
hardware is being taken by sculptors

554
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,679
they are not making money with the the

555
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,520
services because they are not being

556
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,679
uh used right so i guess that's that's

557
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,760
another point why they're not interested

558
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,919
on that

559
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,840
all right so i don't have any questions

560
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,480
i don't see any other questions um

561
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,840
thank you very much for for your

562
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,159
presentation i appreciate it

563
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,840
thank you for having us great thank you
