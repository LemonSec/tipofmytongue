1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,279
hopefully you can see my screen

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,319
yep

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,430
seeing you it's light so take it away

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,639
[Applause]

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,320
okay yes

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,280
as question said i'm klaus i'm a

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,000
the community community manager at the

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,920
at krautsec

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,600
um and i've been an interesting

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,039
professional for for close to 20 years

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,480
um

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,439
right

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,400
yes

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,480
um this is what i'm going to talk about

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,159
today um

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,079
i first want to say

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,600
something about half we've been looking

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,920
at at cyber security up until now that

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
it's really not complicated as such

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,719
that we've been doing it wrong basically

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,079
and then then i'll talk to you about why

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,960
why we think a crowd approach

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,719
is the right way to do this better

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,160
then i'll tell you then we'll tell you a

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,079
little bit about how um

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,160
how the tool that the cloud take opens

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,920
off to works and then in the end i will

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,559
uh go into a case study uh where you can

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,000
use crowdsec to be details with uh

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,920
yeah with witchcraft stick and

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,920
cloudflare

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,840
yeah sorry

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,520
cyber security is

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,640
as

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,520
some may some may think um

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,600
it's not a complicated problem

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,080
because complicated problems those those

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,960
are the one that that needs a genius

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,000
to dissolve and this is the einstein's

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,159
design science theory of of relativity

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,880
and that is complicated

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,680
and

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
instead

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,399
cyber security is complex

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,560
and complex problems that's a completely

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,000
different ballgame

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
those can be solved if you're working as

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,280
a team

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,079
and

50
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,680
what is hard especially in cyber

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,560
security and and definitely also

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,240
when you're sending people to the moon

53
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
is there so many things you have to make

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,719
sure to remember and to have confidence

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,320
for and that's hard

56
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,640
both in terms of mastering each and

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,960
every one of the steps but also to be do

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,720
to be able to do the right

59
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,200
every single time

60
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,000
so

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,319
this is the summer complicated problem

62
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,840
they get back into solved by one smart

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,360
person

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
for complex problems you need a couple

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,400
like you need a book to collaborate so

66
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,640
we tried our powering that field

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,800
we found out smarting the criminals that

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,840
also failed so instead we try another

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,319
approach which is outnumbering them

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,000
so instead of trying to be rambo and

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,280
fight against a thousand enemies and

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
that only works in films anyway

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,120
with a risk guy this is just a hype

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,160
approach

75
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,280
so

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,519
nobody wants to say wants to fight an

77
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,680
entire beehive so anybody in the right

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,000
mind they would just run away instead

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,599
and that's what we were basically what

80
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,720
we want the hackers to do

81
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,360
these all example of companies that has

82
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,400
has had

83
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
so many so much money for cyber security

84
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,120
and and yet and yet they messed up

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,800
um all of these has big budgets

86
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
last team and extraordinary people

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
to help them defend themselves and yet

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,760
they were hacked

89
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,920
one of these i gave him morgan they have

90
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,560
they had a security budget of 800

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,800
million us dollars

92
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,640
per annual and and

93
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,440
that's almost 1 billion u.s dollars and

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,400
and

95
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
i don't know about you guys but i can't

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,640
i can't imagine that much money

97
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,239
so

98
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,519
it's really not

99
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,840
a matter of resources because

100
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
yeah bottom line is

101
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,720
the approach is wrong

102
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,319
and

103
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,040
yeah

104
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,200
there's a reason why it's not solved

105
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,920
because defending is hard really hard

106
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,319
because time to patch

107
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,760
that's way too long

108
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,920
uh maybe that's too much to patch too

109
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
few people to do it

110
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,080
maybe your parameter is really large

111
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,599
maybe it's maybe it's all

112
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,920
maybe it's even larger than it has to be

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,360
who knows

114
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
um and that's money money don't go on

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,920
trees and many companies

116
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,080
still don't take the risk of ransomware

117
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,280
seriously will they ever who knows

118
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,400
so

119
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
the thing with attacking is that that

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,839
that is so much cheaper and it takes a

121
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,600
lot a lot less resources so

122
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
and unbeknowingly many people makes

123
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,080
these easy to hack them by having you

124
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,520
know an unsecured device and the

125
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,120
parameter and

126
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
then they're hacked or they don't have

127
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,840
anything

128
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,280
installed on endpoints to protect them

129
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,199
sorry um yeah oops

130
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,280
so like the cast of strategy that we use

131
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
as the 80s

132
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
we have a big castle we

133
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,440
have we have a big wave around it

134
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,400
uh

135
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,240
that doesn't work anymore because the

136
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,800
parameter is all over the place

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,080
so

138
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,800
um because the reality nowadays is that

139
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
everybody

140
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
every company even those who doesn't

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,360
know it they have some resources

142
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,039
somewhere in the cloud

143
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,560
um

144
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
so it's practically it's not practically

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
possible to protect everything from a

146
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,600
single from a central point

147
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,280
since that all resources

148
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,360
all resources have to have has to defend

149
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,840
themselves autonomous autonomously for

150
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,000
this to this work for this to work

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,280
properly

152
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,120
so and the way threat data should be

153
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,440
shared across the means using http

154
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,520
because that's that's a light protocol

155
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,000
and every device knows it

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,720
so

157
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
we want to leverage either reputation in

158
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
the cloud to build the biggest most

159
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
accurate real-time ip

160
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,240
reputation database

161
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,840
so you can think of us

162
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,759
our fingers and zoom of course

163
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,639
as uh as the waves of cyber security and

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,039
that's what what we are doing building

165
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,840
with this project it is already the

166
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,960
the biggest

167
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,759
crowdsource hr network in the world

168
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,520
our founders they all have a background

169
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,080
in security in a secure hosting company

170
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,160
all developers and our cto they all have

171
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,280
a background spam testers so we know how

172
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,080
to build a secure infrastructure

173
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,800
the way

174
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,319
crowdset works

175
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,000
is that first

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,919
it collects the data on your on your

177
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,240
host it passes the log

178
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
and

179
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,199
whenever there is something that looked

180
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,280
like that looks like an attack it's a

181
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,199
it's being sent to our

182
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,800
to our um

183
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,400
hive mind if you want to say that um

184
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
the the big inspiration here is is fail

185
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,919
japan

186
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,360
we wanted we wanted to build a modern

187
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
version of failsament but then it ended

188
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,160
up to be

189
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
end up being way more versatile than in

190
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,600
failed japan

191
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
i'll talk a little bit about that later

192
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,080
after logs are added

193
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,560
then threats are detected in the

194
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,280
by the agent and then logs from

195
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
either locally or from the communities

196
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,199
analyzed to detect if there are cinnamon

197
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,560
level and behavior

198
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,400
by our background

199
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,639
based on the unfriend intelligence

200
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,560
boundaries that's the second part of the

201
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,759
software

202
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,800
they

203
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,639
will they will remediate

204
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,880
either they will block on every on the

205
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,240
on the

206
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,319
firewall layer

207
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,880
layer 3 or orient or run the application

208
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,360
layers which is layer 7.

209
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,440
so whenever bad traffic is detected

210
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
those findings are shared back with the

211
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,720
community so every other crowdsync user

212
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,599
crossing agent can can use that

213
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,479
for intelligence

214
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,120
theoretically um

215
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,360
the tool can handle any any scenarios

216
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,000
that fails a band that can handle but

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,639
but not yet uh in practice because

218
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,400
fields of ben has is

219
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,960
20 years old and has had a supportive

220
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,520
community for a very long time

221
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,039
so so eventually whenever we go big and

222
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,479
it's more known

223
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,400
all those scenarios will come

224
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,759
but

225
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,879
in theory

226
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,800
we can handle everything that can this

227
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,280
can be described by ammo and passed by a

228
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,960
password

229
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,919
so

230
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,080
our interference engine can handle so

231
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,919
it's had to handle some

232
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,759
some like some scenarios at a much more

233
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,599
complex standard than what fails the

234
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,039
bank can

235
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,560
we will handle

236
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,160
an in an entire

237
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
ddos

238
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,879
scenario which will which we will talk

239
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,599
about later we can also handle resource

240
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,440
appears like we plug in the tires access

241
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,720
to a website if they're trying to

242
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,160
exhaust that website by mass rolling

243
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,280
also

244
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,000
we

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,160
we can bend an inside ip class if some

246
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,559
and that's why they fall five they have

247
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,120
already been banned then the whole ip

248
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,599
class will just be banned just like that

249
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,519
and of course much much more are just

250
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,360
examples and also what you'll see on the

251
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
screen are also examples of

252
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,760
of scenarios where

253
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,200
where dropship can be used

254
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,160
to some to zombies we think that cyber

255
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,240
criminals they've had it's too easy for

256
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,480
too long so what we're trying to do here

257
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,440
with

258
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,200
with crowds i guess to to shift the

259
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,080
balance of power we want them we want

260
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,959
people to be able to work together

261
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,040
by by sharing and collecting all the

262
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,360
straight intelligence for the benefit of

263
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,560
the entire

264
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,279
of the entire crowd so ultimately we

265
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,720
want to force the hackers to change

266
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,320
their tactics or

267
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,200
go somewhere else

268
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,839
the potential threat insulting the

269
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,680
spirit generated by crosstalk that is

270
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,839
more more real than any than others

271
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,040
because it's not simulated from

272
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,959
honeypots it's from real production

273
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,959
servers all around the world that just

274
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:33,839
has

275
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,519
the uh

276
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,360
crowd segregated insult

277
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,680
because as we say you you can't dodge

278
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,239
the crowd

279
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,040
and as a bonus

280
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
the cloud6 software is free no matter

281
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,880
what happens to crowdsick

282
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
because like the company

283
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,200
worst case is that the code is for and

284
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,839
then the community will simply move away

285
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,440
so the code alone

286
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,600
that's useless it's only in combination

287
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
with the community that it gets that it

288
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,200
gets its value

289
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,839
the back end is not yet uh open source

290
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,480
but but that's mostly because it's

291
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,399
it's not fully developed and and the

292
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,240
code is really not that

293
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,720
stable it's not good to it's stable but

294
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,560
it's not we don't want to show it up

295
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,360
it's just show it show it to anyone yet

296
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,279
but but we will eventually because we

297
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,160
really want to make it very

298
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,480
very visible how this decision present

299
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,160
process is working and how our

300
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,200
decision-making is working behind

301
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,800
kind

302
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,920
yeah behind the scene

303
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,200
every ip that's in the database that's

304
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,000
uh

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,399
they are thrown out after 72 hours

306
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,160
i'll talk a little bit more about the

307
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,760
decision process which we call the

308
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,680
consensus engine on the next line

309
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
every agent that sends

310
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
rogue

311
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
broke the ips

312
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,160
to what we first call the smoke database

313
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,519
then

314
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,839
then based on this

315
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,040
we are we will determine which

316
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
which ips are bad

317
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
and over time

318
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,399
we also want to integrate

319
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,640
this consensus engine and and the ips

320
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,279
outcome that comes out of it then

321
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,600
into an in the enterprise in instant

322
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,160
response uh process so that ioc is

323
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,920
thinking the thinkery part of the

324
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,680
trading process that normally take place

325
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
in you know in a tool life like

326
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,479
frenchman's mist

327
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
project contingency and that this that

328
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,200
base is a decision on various criteria

329
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,640
that all combine

330
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,320
one of them is the regularity of the

331
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,399
watcher that's what we call a

332
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,040
contributor or an agent internally

333
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
also the consistency compared to all the

334
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,959
users data and craft stakes and

335
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,279
consolidated statistics

336
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,959
that we correlate with crowds like zone

337
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,399
own hypothes

338
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,920
and high reputation watches i know i

339
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,760
said before that data is from honeypot

340
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,600
we but we do have our own

341
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,399
so that we can we can control every both

342
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,360
ends

343
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,279
of the system so to speak so we know

344
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,120
which system generate which log just to

345
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
make sure that everything is working is

346
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,360
going right but but there are a very

347
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,160
small part of of the entire

348
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,320
ip representation database

349
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,079
then we're crosstaking this with third

350
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,079
party sources and we're enriching the

351
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,760
consensus process with information from

352
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,440
other sources if if that's possible

353
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,279
and usually when i talk about crowdsake

354
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,360
people always want to ask if it's

355
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,399
possible to to poison our database and

356
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,320
yes it's possible

357
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,720
but but it's hard because you really

358
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,800
have to have an army of

359
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,279
of uh false agents so to speak that

360
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,680
would feed that would consistently feed

361
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,480
a

362
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,639
visa our database first with a lot of

363
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,200
real real data and then you would have

364
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,920
you would have to like inject those bad

365
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,519
or those fake

366
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,040
fake attacker ips into our data stream

367
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
and and that's pretty hard because you

368
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,800
wouldn't even be sure if they would be

369
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,240
selected anyway or be remarked bad

370
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,079
and also there are ips that that you

371
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,680
will never be able to

372
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,320
to a ban because we are we are widening

373
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,360
them permanently those are like ceo bots

374
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,040
and

375
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,519
and the cn partners like franklin's law

376
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,519
fair

377
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,399
we take

378
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,480
td bar and privacy various areas because

379
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,600
obviously that's always always uh

380
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,240
people's concern if they can if they can

381
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,000
remain in our messy and the only thing

382
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,600
that we send back

383
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,959
is um

384
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,120
is as little as we can to to do a

385
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,519
reliable consensus so we only

386
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,519
tie ip information to a random generator

387
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,639
uid

388
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,480
to immediately identify the crowd the

389
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,040
crowd state agent that has submitted

390
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,230
those ivs

391
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,040
[Music]

392
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,920
and

393
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,199
right now

394
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,720
yeah we're around the

395
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,639
20 000

396
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,880
installs worldwide

397
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,760
across six continents and 110 countries

398
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,720
since as far as i remember

399
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,360
and we have over time we've we have

400
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,959
detected

401
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,479
and verified or at least

402
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,279
chosen that the seven hundred thousand

403
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,760
ips are malicious

404
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,800
across a lot of different industries

405
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,120
and then our goal is to be

406
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,000
one million users in 2024

407
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,720
and

408
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
that's a long way to go

409
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,279
um

410
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,519
now i want to talk

411
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,639
specifically about about the how to how

412
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,920
to do a level do layer seven uh inside

413
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,160
details with uh with crouch signal

414
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,199
cloudflare

415
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,839
there is a anti-id dose built into into

416
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,560
cloudflare but but this is uh as you

417
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,040
would see in a short while this is a

418
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,600
more effective

419
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,560
um

420
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
when we talk about

421
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,800
anti-ddots there is at least two

422
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,440
examples and one of them is happening on

423
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,880
layer three

424
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,560
uh it does

425
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,760
that's not what we're talking about

426
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,880
we're talking about layer seven the

427
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
application layer

428
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,240
um

429
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,399
where yeah where this attack is is going

430
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:12,800
on

431
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
[Music]

432
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,240
um this is

433
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
our setup is uh it's basically a

434
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,560
wordpress a wordpress server with

435
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,160
commerce that we set up on a dps in aws

436
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,519
with two cn cores and four gigs of ram

437
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,279
then we found they does as a service and

438
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,759
basically hammered that on our side for

439
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,199
20 minutes and

440
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,959
this is what happened

441
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,959
you can see that on the

442
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:39,519
it screen

443
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,759
it went down of course

444
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,600
and after 20 minutes

445
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,639
um

446
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,399
it had received 70 000 hdtv requests and

447
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,880
from 1150 unique ip addresses

448
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,480
and um

449
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,519
our approach to to fixing this is is

450
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,440
described here and those country facts

451
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
they're completely arbitrary and they

452
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
don't reflect any particular opinion

453
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,600
towards that particular country

454
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
just saying

455
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,560
um we assume that for

456
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
for each

457
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,720
each human visitor there will be like

458
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,519
one to two http requests

459
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,920
per visitor and that's the norm so

460
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,839
basically we want to say that everything

461
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,199
that's not

462
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,800
a normal a request will be filled away

463
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,639
um and also we want to be able to take

464
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,800
decisions on either a country level or

465
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,920
an as number level this is this is where

466
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,279
cloudflare comes into the into the

467
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,880
picture and this is what they can do

468
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,680
when

469
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,600
via their api

470
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,320
so the api allows space on as country

471
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,680
and just not ips and ranges

472
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,199
and also the api allows us to remediate

473
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,199
a capture or just challenge that's

474
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,519
similar arithmetic arithmetic challenges

475
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,320
as

476
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,040
only humans suppose you can do

477
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,800
so what happens here

478
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,959
in the agent doing this uh during this

479
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,440
attack or doing the simulation is that

480
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,359
castigating will reach the log from read

481
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,679
log from a pressure 2

482
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,400
then

483
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,359
it will identify what is what is attack

484
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,799
and then they will

485
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,359
send those directly to the balancer

486
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,880
the bouncer will then activate cloud

487
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,119
cloudflare api

488
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,799
and then firewall rules within

489
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,199
cloudflare will block those connections

490
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,959
and

491
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,440
yeah this is a diagram of of what

492
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,600
happened you can see around the 30 the

493
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,200
attack starts

494
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,280
and network goes up

495
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,160
cpu utilization goes up

496
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,360
and then

497
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,080
approximately how we look at it five six

498
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,919
seven minutes later

499
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,840
everything is back to normal

500
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,559
and the two of those minutes that's

501
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,799
delayed internally in cloudflare from

502
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,720
when you order a

503
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,960
fiber rule in the api

504
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,200
it takes it takes two minutes before

505
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,840
that rule is into effect

506
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,600
um

507
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,880
yeah i want to talk a little bit about

508
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,080
how

509
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
the internal decision is is made within

510
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,080
front within crowd's sake as

511
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,559
the attack goes on

512
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,320
we

513
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,080
the elastic oh sorry

514
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
the crow stick agent

515
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,880
uh groups all http requests by source

516
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
country

517
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,320
and then

518
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,039
and we and we only allow

519
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,080
requests from 50 distinct ips per 30

520
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,360
seconds

521
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,960
and this is where the bugger come in

522
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,039
comes in because this is this is

523
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,559
this is what we call the leaky bucket

524
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,679
approach so once that deposit overflows

525
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,400
then the scenario is triggered

526
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,360
first

527
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
car cycle block

528
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,640
country a whole country if if if

529
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,320
the if the entire country is deemed bad

530
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,120
then it will block by as number and then

531
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,679
it will block every single ip that's

532
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,840
malicious until all the malicious

533
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,919
traffic is gone

534
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,440
firewall rules i said before they are

535
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
created they are created in cloudflare

536
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,080
via cloudflare api

537
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,360
and what's

538
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,919
really interesting about about this is

539
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,600
that i said before it

540
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,919
it it doesn't necessarily block all

541
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,520
traffic from the country

542
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
by forcing

543
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,840
the users to go through a capital that's

544
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,160
what we call a fixed rule

545
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,960
that's

546
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,480
that that's really what what we're going

547
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,960
to use here also also because it's uh

548
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,120
somewhat less risky because

549
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,600
the user is never blocked a real user

550
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,360
has never blocked them that is a really

551
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,400
really strong point here so the risk of

552
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,760
of fault positive so to speak is a lot

553
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,480
is a lot less

554
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,480
so yeah let's see how it looks

555
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,600
first uh first off we'll start the the

556
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,320
ddos attack

557
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,480
the numbers on the top that's simply the

558
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,880
tail of the apache 2 lock

559
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,919
and on the downright there is the uh

560
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,240
crowdstick cli

561
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,720
and as the attack goes by you'll see how

562
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,400
how

563
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,320
how the agents start to identify

564
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,520
something going wrong with india

565
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,280
something somewhere around russia

566
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,640
and you will see there's a lot of

567
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,080
different ips right now

568
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,440
and and that's a lot going on

569
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,600
so it so basically stated that that for

570
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,280
those three countries and that as number

571
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,919
it will force the capture

572
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,039
and it's starting to um

573
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,760
to order those in cloud fair and save

574
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,000
little time i said before

575
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
then gradually

576
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,360
you will see

577
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,440
fabric start to slow down

578
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,320
you also see that

579
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,080
the traffic will come from fewer fewer

580
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
ips

581
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,520
and then eventually that only be

582
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,200
really yeah

583
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,520
few ips and deaths and over time those

584
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,799
will be

585
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,679
really banned as well

586
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,600
yeah

587
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,840
just follow on the on the cli

588
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,240
more countries are being banned

589
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,600
more ips are being banned

590
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,240
and and that's as they they individually

591
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,919
generate more traffic than we allow then

592
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,440
we'll

593
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,919
block them

594
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,840
and eventually it will go away

595
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,600
you can see that this is an ip from hong

596
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,159
kong this china this amazon

597
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,159
also

598
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,360
impressive yeah

599
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,799
or bristle

600
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,480
the ddos is now fully mitigated but

601
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,320
the attack still goes on

602
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,360
but we just can't can see that that is

603
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,039
that looks more like a normal user

604
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,200
yep

605
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,280
sorry

606
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
so basically um

607
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,918
that was it

608
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,159
we um

609
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,240
yeah as i said before we we we have to

610
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,320
ride being a or our founders has tried

611
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,080
being a secure hosting company so so we

612
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,880
hope or at least think that we can build

613
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,799
a secure security as well

614
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,480
and also we also think that this is a

615
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,400
really great idea that we really hope

616
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,120
and

617
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,480
the community will catch on catch on to

618
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,679
one of my um my task will be to

619
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,520
to facilitate building that that

620
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,600
community and facilitate

621
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,679
talking to the community about

622
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,919
which features people want and what

623
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,240
makes sense and of course also encourage

624
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,799
people to to contribute because you can

625
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,000
basically contribute anything

626
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,120
you can go to

627
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,320
our github

628
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,919
to try it out

629
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,600

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,679
thank you very much klaus

637
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,679
i hope i hope it wasn't i hope i wasn't

638
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,799
stuttering

639
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,280
as if as i feel myself

640
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
no worries about this

641
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,919
so uh we're going to have like a

642
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,320
a long break here before the next talk

643
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,760
so in the meantime like you mentioned

644
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,840
that the

645
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,679
the tool is not jet open source right

646
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,799
the tool is not jet open source

647
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,760
no

648
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,679
everything is not open source the the

649
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,159
back end is not open source yet

650
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,039
but

651
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,480
but we we want to make it real

652
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,960
transparent how the process is is made

653
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,720
so that you can see that it's really

654
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,760
being done

655
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,640
in the way we say it is and does not and

656
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,480
not something else

657
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,240
and also and also that that will also

658
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,520
illustrate how

659
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,039
how hard it is to to poison the database

660
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,320
right so

661
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,840
you're going to open source that right

662
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,679
like uh like more or less like what is

663
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,559
the timeline more or less

664
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,799
we're not sure yet i haven't heard any

665
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,520
specific details and i'm not

666
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,679
sure that it's going to be the same

667
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,600
open source license because

668
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,520
that is uh

669
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,440
it it is it is this strange mix that we

670
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,720
want to hold it happens a little bit

671
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,159
closer but we also want it to be

672
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,360
transparent

673
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,760
yeah so i don't i don't really know what

674
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,679
we're gonna do but but we're we'll we'll

675
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,799
think of something

676
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,960
that that will sort of satisfy both

677
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,120
needs i'm sure

678
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,679
