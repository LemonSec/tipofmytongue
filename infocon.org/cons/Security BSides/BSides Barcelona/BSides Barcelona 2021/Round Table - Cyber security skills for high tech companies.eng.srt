um

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,439
unfortunately sorry unfortunately i'm

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,760
not allowed to start my video okay give

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,680
me one second yeah let's give a second

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,439
as i said we have some a little bit of

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,360
technical issues but

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,720
i should be able to

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,840
um

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,240
to allow you to

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
do that

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,600
um sure what it is now

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,320
okay let me double check if there is a

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,399
way to do so here if not

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,799
yeah i think we have okay you know what

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,840
i'm gonna make you calls

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,960
i think

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,079
this should work

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,799
does it allow you now to start your

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,200
video

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,040
and can you see me perfect i can

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,240

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,159
yeah policies for this like you know

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,520
glitch again as i said we had um this

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
technical issue we had to rechange our

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,759
links and and perhaps we need a couple

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,360
of things in the

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,919
configuration so i'm basically promoting

53
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,720

175
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,400
then because my passion was uh all

176
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,639
things hacking i did a lot of product

177
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,800
security and currently because my

178
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,240
passion is really offensive the

179
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,720
offensive security side of things

180
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,280
i'm working in a in a red team

181
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,319
and it is a pleasure and an honor to be

182
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,400
to be invited to such a

183
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
such a panel of of experts and

184
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,440
especially for such an important

185
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
conversation as we're going to have

186
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,440
100 thank you all much appreciated so

187
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
as all our viewers and listeners know

188
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,840
our topic for this roundtable session is

189
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,000
on cyber security skills for high-tech

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
companies we will be talking about

191
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,039
talent acquisition diversity and

192
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,680
retention as martin vigo just mentioned

193
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,440
which are very interesting topics across

194
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
all industries which i personally

195
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,599
believe will always attract

196
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,240
attention due to its nature so let's

197
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,080
let's jump straight in let's start with

198
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,680
the topic on

199
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,440
talent acquisition

200
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,479
and if i could begin with asking

201
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,720
either lola or maria

202
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,800
could you please describe to our

203
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,080
audience what talent acquisition is

204
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,160
and what it means to an organization in

205
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,280
today's world

206
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,680
sure i can i can take that is that yeah

207
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,879
i'll take that and so towns acquisition

208
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,960
is how how you

209
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,759
um how you acquire your top talent so

210
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,639
how you source how you find your talent

211
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,039
and how you can be compete in the the

212
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,440
people market and within a such a

213
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,240
strong competitive zone such as cyber

214
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,080
security so and for us that is sourcing

215
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,279
finding

216
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,519
getting the hook getting them in hiring

217
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,519
them getting them through the process

218
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,000
and getting them in the door into into

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
our amazing organization

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,519
um and it's

221
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,480
the difference for me i i don't have

222
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
a strong cyber security background

223
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
i have a very strong tech background and

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,720
i've learned so much here at times in

225
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
terms of how we acquire the cyber

226
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,399
security people and it is far more

227
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,200
challenging than many other roles within

228
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,399
the tech organization

229
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
that's great and lola would you like to

230
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,360
add in addition anything to that

231
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,440
yeah um i think the only thing i would

232
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
definitely add i think it's on the

233
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,480
competition piece um uh you know

234
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,800
definitely if there it is a somewhat of

235
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
war um on talent

236
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,720
um and understanding what the best is so

237
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,560
you know every um company and department

238
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,519
and

239
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,320
um team manager will have a concept of

240
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,160
what they believe the best is the best

241
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,040
fit

242
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,720
so having a good understanding of what

243
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
that is for that particular unique

244
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,800
opportunity and trying to meet the needs

245
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,920
of that

246
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,480
trying to do that effectively

247
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,760
oh that's great that's a great

248
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,519
introduction

249
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,080
talking about competition um and

250
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,160
attracting talent

251
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,399
how do organizations or how can

252
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,000
organizations

253
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,079
ensure that they are attracting the best

254
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,200
talent

255
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
and in your opinion

256
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,519
what do you believe are realistic

257
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,120
expectations

258
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,279
that organizations actually want to see

259
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,839
in candidates

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,399
um i think when it comes to actually

261
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,680
attracting

262
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,240
the best candidates um

263
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,040
i always think organizations should ask

264
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,279
themselves well why should anyone join

265
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,200
us right so

266
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,880
um i think when you think of it from

267
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
that perspective that's the that's the

268
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,640
best place to start

269
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,760
um one thing people love um regardless

270
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,640
of the type of business it is is

271
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,800
a challenging opportunity

272
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,120
so um have being able to solve a problem

273
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,279
um and if you're honest about what that

274
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,800
looks like i think that's one of the

275
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,560
best ways of actually attracting the

276
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,120
right and the best people because quite

277
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,360
often when someone has been in a role

278
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,760
maybe for a certain amount of time it

279
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,480
starts to kind of feel like bau like

280
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
business as usual and actually people do

281
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
often want to get their teeth stuck into

282
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,160
something new right um or get the

283
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
opportunity to build or set something up

284
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,680
from scratch so i think um really that's

285
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,880
the first thing

286
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,519
one what type of position it is is it

287
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,760
and what type of opportunity is there

288
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,160
for that person to really flex their

289
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,640
muscles or build up skills

290
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,399
um or or do um a project or activity in

291
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
a more in-depth way

292
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,680
um

293
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,560
and then i'm sorry i forgot the second

294
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,640
part of the question i know it's just

295
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
really about what organizations you know

296
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,720
what their expectations are what they

297
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,800
want to see in candidates but i think

298
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
from my perspective

299
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
a candidate that wants to be challenged

300
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,200
consistently is a major plus point right

301
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,079
exactly yeah so i think what what

302
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,920
businesses are definitely looking for

303
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,200
what companies are definitely looking

304
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,720
for is

305
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,880
quite often when you are joining a

306
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,519
company or joining to solve a problem

307
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,600
so they are looking for people that have

308
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
that problem-solving mindset so

309
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,160
um you know we'll probably go on to this

310
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,800
a little later on but this is where um

311
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,639
you know into the purpose of the

312
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,720
interview is to really understand how

313
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,600
you approach problems um it doesn't

314
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,040
necessarily mean you always come out

315
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,639
with the best solution but how do you

316
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,200
work with people how do you tackle it uh

317
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,880
when it doesn't work the first time what

318
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,839
do you do then right um so they're using

319
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,440
that as an opportunity to really

320
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,800
understand whether you're going to be

321
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,279
able to do what they need you to do

322
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,959
it's not just about having that

323
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,519
technical skill set it's also how you

324
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,839
apply that and how you work you know in

325
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,920
general as well

326
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,160
absolutely and what about what are your

327
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,600
thoughts on

328
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
people skills

329
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
you know people that fit into the

330
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,200
organization especially culture i think

331
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,600
culture is absolutely incredibly

332
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,680
important and candidates need to be able

333
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,079
to fit in no matter what the culture is

334
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,839
like from my experience i've worked in

335
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,240
banking i worked in the public sector

336
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,440
and you know the two different

337
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
industries essentially even though my

338
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,160
role was very similar but culture is an

339
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,480
important important piece right

340
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,360
culture is um

341
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,560
yeah it is super important and actually

342
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,639
what is important to i don't know an

343
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,800
investment bank for instance

344
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,519
won't necessarily be important to a tech

345
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,000
startup or scale-up so i think one of

346
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,800
the things that's really important is

347
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,639
to understand the business that you are

348
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,399
approaching or talking to do your

349
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,560
research what does their website show

350
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,600
you what do their social feeds show you

351
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
um you know if you're not seeing much

352
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,199
about company culture then it could be

353
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,040
that there isn't much of a company

354
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
culture you know if it when it comes to

355
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,600
perhaps celebrating people etc so

356
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
definitely do your due diligence and

357
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,360
really think about is this the kind of

358
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,920
space i actually want to work in

359
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,800
i also recommend you know if you can go

360
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,279
on linkedin quite often when you click

361
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,199
on the company you can see the people

362
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,199
working within that company

363
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,360
you know just browse see where they've

364
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
been where have they worked before again

365
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,519
to get a sense of not just the culture

366
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,120
of the business but the culture of the

367
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,800
people who are you know the culture that

368
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,120
they worked in before and therefore what

369
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,680
they're bringing into the business so i

370
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,760
think really the most important thing is

371
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,760
having a realistic sense and

372
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,120
understanding

373
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
of the culture of the business because i

374
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,000
think a lot of people think okay i'm

375
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
working in tech so

376
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
working in this company is going to work

377
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
in this way and it really depends on the

378
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,399
industry

379
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,720
of the company when was the company

380
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,160
founded that's usually a big indicator

381
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,199
um as well so definitely i would say

382
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,040
just do your due diligence and and

383
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,680
research and see what you can find

384
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,480
great leather thank you sorry korea yeah

385
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,320
if i could just add to the culture piece

386
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
i i think they're they're phenomenal

387
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,839
tips and there's just one thing that has

388
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,839
recently come up internally that i'd

389
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,000
love to add we're we're a startup and

390
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,639
we're we're really trying to

391
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,399
define what our culture is which as we

392
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,639
all know is really difficult to do

393
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,880
especially at this stage so we've had a

394
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,720
couple of focus groups those were very

395
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,040
much about gathering information from

396
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
everybody in the business and one thing

397
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,519
that struck me about culture when i was

398
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,440
talking about like us getting our

399
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,199
statements out there our values out

400
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,839
there was i was so impressed with the

401
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,199
team saying

402
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,440
but let's back it up with actions so

403
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,279
that's the other thing that i'd advise

404
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,040
people to to look at there's there's

405
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,440
plenty we can all think of amazing

406
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,839
companies that have the best websites

407
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,079
and the best statements out there but

408
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,920
let's look behind that and let's look at

409
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,600
the actions that the actions that they

410
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,759
are doing to back that up so what we're

411
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,680
trying to do here at times is start with

412
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,839
the actions so that when we make those

413
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,759
statements we can bring in those

414
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,880
examples

415
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,199
live on our website on linkedin on

416
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,600
socials and get it out there

417
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,519
and then the other part of that is an

418
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,079
interview so that we can speak to actual

419
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,639
actions and impress candidates that way

420
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,399
that's something that we're definitely

421
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,240
looking for so to flip it on the

422
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,600
candidate side i would definitely

423
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,440
recommend they look for the actions as

424
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,839
well as the statements

425
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,440
that's great lola maria thank you so

426
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
much that's great and and now to of

427
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,199
course bring our security experts into

428
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,079
the same conversation so um and a

429
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,560
question to both both martin harper and

430
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,920
martin vigo

431
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,279
you know given the

432
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,240
exponential increase in global security

433
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,279
incidents

434
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,440
data breaches

435
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,079
news reports that are disclosing

436
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,079
new hacks against organizations pretty

437
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,120
much on a daily basis from what i see

438
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,000
in your opinion how do you believe

439
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,399
organizations or even cyber security

440
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,639
teams or it teams

441
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,199
can actually adapt successful

442
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,079
talent acquisition programs and ensure

443
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,519
that the talent that they are bringing

444
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,320
in

445
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,240
again as lola maria mentioned is to keep

446
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,480
them challenged how can those programs

447
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,400
be successful in based on what we see

448
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,319
today in the real world specifically to

449
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,480
cyber security

450
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,400
yeah that's that's a great question

451
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,799
because there is definitely

452
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
a

453
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,559
the word out that there is not enough

454
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,799
people uh trained in cyber security to

455
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,880
fulfill all the openings that we have

456
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,599
right and as as you very well mentioned

457
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,039
with the profession especially of

458
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,039
ransomware attacks that got so much

459
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,720
visibility to all the audience beyond

460
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,960
the hacking community or the cyber

461
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,080
security

462
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,200
uh

463
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,160
people

464
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,360
and

465
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
other companies started to catch up and

466
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,039
realizing okay i don't want to lose i

467
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,720
don't want to be open to lose this many

468
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,880
million dollars because of one incident

469
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,120
so i need a neck to bring in an expert

470
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,000
and take care of this so one challenge

471
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,120
that the

472
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,840
that the industry has is cyber security

473
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,160
is fairly new so

474
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,960
finding especially senior people

475
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,440
especially challenge if already and uh

476
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,240
the hr experts here will will will know

477
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,160
better than me but if already finding

478
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,240
juniors or or in entry-level um

479
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,080
candidates it's already challenging

480
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,720
imagine finding really senior people

481
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
i always joke with friends around that

482
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,559
here in silicon valley where you will

483
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,520
expect that all the experts are right

484
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,039
there is like 12 13 14 seasons like the

485
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,160
higher ups the most the the the position

486
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
with the most responsibility when it

487
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,919
comes to information security they just

488
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,840
go around the companies you know like

489
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,840
there are about 15 guys and women that

490
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,000
uh they just change companies among

491
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,600
themselves that are just not much more

492
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,080
just because the industry is what like

493
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,000
30 40 max 50 years if we really go to a

494
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,360
kind of the 70s when this all started so

495
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,840
it's difficult to be in hr and having to

496
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,880
bring people with seniority so now to

497
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,799
address your question more specifically

498
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,120
how can we do that my opinion obviously

499
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
from the perspective as one of those

500
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,679
candidates right what i've encountered

501
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,080
i can speak what is something that makes

502
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,880
me go choose a company over another

503
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,520
i was taking notes as as lola was

504
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,440
speaking here for me

505
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,240
one of the things that i've encountered

506
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,720
that has literally pushed me away from

507
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,400
that company even though i liked the

508
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,280
rest

509
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,480
was not having the possibility to

510
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,400
do research and present it at

511
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,919
conferences so for me that's a big

512
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,440
aspect of what i like to do it has i

513
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,280
could go on and on of the value that it

514
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,200
has for the company but i understand

515
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,120
this is not a critic but i understand

516
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
that there are companies that are

517
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,360
concerned of the legalities so or they

518
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,000
just don't really understand the culture

519
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,559
of of doing research in cyber security

520
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,720
going to big conferences to talk about

521
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,280
vulnerabilities they are just scared

522
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,880
that you may talk about one of their

523
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,000
clients or something like that or

524
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,039
someone will get upset and impact the

525
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,919
company or the business so for me when i

526
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,080
go interview with a company and they

527
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,919
tell me they don't have a

528
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,320
strong open policy on

529
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,400
do research or of course always

530
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,240
responsible right i'm not going to drop

531
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,080
zero days or critic vulnerabilities

532
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,919
without doing responsible disclosure but

533
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,600
that for me is a turn off and i will

534
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,559
probably pick another company

535
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,039
then training being able to get training

536
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,559
as you are at the company that there is

537
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,440
a specific budget to at least take a

538
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,760
training a year because you cyber

539
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,159
security in general computer science but

540
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,200
you get

541
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,000
you get rusty very quick like it evolves

542
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,240
so fast and when it comes to the threat

543
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
landscape we see it how it evolves every

544
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,080
day so if you don't get proper training

545
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,159
if that company doesn't provide you that

546
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,720
service then it's it's it's another

547
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,120
turnoff for me and then i will have

548
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,799
nowadays with

549
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,280
how the pandemic has changed

550
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,240
the landscape as well right flexibility

551
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,080
and here we have to differentiate i

552
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,320
guess in ages right probably the new

553
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,640
grads they don't care so much about that

554
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,400
they just want to cool work on cool

555
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
stuff enough opportunities to learn

556
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,080
especially what i would recommend is

557
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,320
look for a great mentor it's probably

558
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,480
most more important that you have a good

559
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,120
boss than a good job so to speak because

560
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,200
having a great mentor is really going to

561
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,640
make a difference at the beginning of

562
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,799
your career but when we look at older

563
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,280
people or older people i don't want to

564
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,760
call myself old but in my age are all

565
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,159
there that are starting to have families

566
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,400
then flexibility is really important

567
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,559
being able to work from home having a

568
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,360
hybrid a work environment in which they

569
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,200
can actually just go several days or

570
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,039
even beyond that if you want to hire

571
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,120
senior people you can't force them to

572
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,039
come to where your heart quarter is if

573
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,880
they live in new york and you have your

574
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,440
headquarters in san francisco and there

575
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,200
is a candidate that is really difficult

576
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
to find

577
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,600
over there

578
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,679
don't force him to come here and change

579
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,600
the kids from going to that school to a

580
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,000
new school they're wise or if it's the

581
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,840
opposite their husbands to have to

582
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,320
change the job and look for another one

583
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,760
whatever it is

584
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,919
that's another challenge that makes it

585
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,280
even more difficult to find senior

586
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,520
people

587
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,039
that's a great answer martin thank you

588
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,559
and it's interesting you mentioned the

589
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,400
pandemic and you mentioned hybrid

590
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,480
working as well as the remote workforce

591
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,280
so

592
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,880
martin i'd like to bring you in as well

593
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,960
on the panel please so could you please

594
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,679
you know from your perspective um

595
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,760
the kovid 19 pandemic

596
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,919
has introduced this new hybrid working

597
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,600
environment right and and this remote

598
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,880
workforce

599
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,280
how difficult in your opinion has that

600
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
transformation been

601
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,440
and what would you say are the lessons

602
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,320
learned

603
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,559
that we could now take with us

604
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,080
going forward

605
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,320
right so it's so it's going to be a

606
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,640
little bit hard for me to uh to say what

607
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,039
has changed because the company

608
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,960
that i worked at right now and the

609
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,640
previous ones as well

610
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,840
were sort of remote friendly from day

611
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,240
one so the teams we've been building

612
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,200
um

613
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,000
were

614
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,919
very distributed um like it's like from

615
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,120
from the get-go right so so this is um

616
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,720
this is something that

617
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,760
uh

618
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,000
it's like previously it was not really

619
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
possible for just one tiny part of a

620
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,039
larger company to say like we're going

621
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,480
to be remote friendly it had to be um

622
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,360
like supported from uh from the company

623
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,720
uh because ultimately security teams uh

624
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,480
work with the rest of the business with

625
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,520
uh engineering product management hr

626
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,280
finance like we

627
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,200
in our day-to-day job pretty much touch

628
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,039
everyone so if they're

629
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,000
the entire company is very focused on

630
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,360
you know bringing people together in

631
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
their offices and

632
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,000
like one all the team that's remote uh

633
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,159
would have had a hard time now you're

634
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,679
right like the companies that started

635
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,159
remote first um i think headed way

636
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,640
easier in the pandemic in that there was

637
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,840
literally no change uh in in how they

638
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,799
operate i can only imagine how um

639
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,120
how much of a transition that would have

640
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,559
to be uh for for other companies um but

641
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,159
you know talking to a lot of friends i

642
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,799
think the industry as a whole

643
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,880
was very successful in adapting like

644
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,120
some companies did better some did worse

645
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,000
um

646
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,679
but a lot of

647
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,679
companies

648
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,360
like they had to make that transition

649
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,480
and fairly

650
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,360
quick at that so uh so they did i think

651
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,039
one thing that kind of helped all of us

652
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,240
was that uh technology was there like

653
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,360
you know video conferencing um instant

654
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,559
messaging tools like uh teams and slack

655
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,840
and um

656
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,440
those things i think

657
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,000
uh in their maturity uh that they you

658
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,840
know we're in a zoom webinar i don't

659
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,440
know how difficult that would be to pull

660
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,000
out like maybe 10 years ago um

661
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,400
uh and today is just non-issue like

662
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,159
those things are just utilities they

663
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,919
work and i think that was uh that was a

664
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,000
tremendous help because then people

665
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,640
could focus on organizing themselves and

666
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
making sure that um you know their

667
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,880
communication protocols are

668
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,120
up to the task in this new um it's a

669
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,200
remote environment and not fight with

670
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,919
the technology so i think that was uh if

671
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,159
if this happened say 10 years ago i

672
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,919
think it would have been uh it would

673
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,120
have been much difficult um

674
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,360
like one thing i i want to mention and

675
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,480
to um

676
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,720
get a circle back to to what martin said

677
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,200
like i think the companies that

678
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,480
are um like very flexible and it doesn't

679
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,039
uh only mean allow people to working

680
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,480
from home but um you know also allowing

681
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
like flexibility and structuring and

682
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,159
structuring your day

683
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,039
uh and the flexibility in

684
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,520
like traveling so working from different

685
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,159
places different time zones as people

686
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,039
um

687
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,480
kind of find it either convenient or

688
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,640
necessary sometimes there are like life

689
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,159
necessities that

690
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,480
um we have to uh we have to take care

691
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,080
like those companies

692
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,760
do have and will have an advantage

693
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,559
because they're naturally a

694
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,400
their talent the talent pool they can

695
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,039
draw from is larger

696
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,919
but also since everyone is remote like

697
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,480
any person that's joining the company as

698
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,720
a remote employee has an easier as an

699
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,960
easier start and i think this is

700
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,159
um like attracting and acquiring talent

701
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:24,960
is

702
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,039
uh like this first necessary step but

703
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,640
everything that comes after that

704
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,360
onboarding people keeping them

705
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,840
you know engaged and included

706
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,679
i think that's that's super important as

707
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,520
well

708
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
that's that's great martin thank you and

709
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,240
and trying not to go off track but you

710
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,880
know being a security enthusiast myself

711
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,559
i would just like to say of course and

712
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,480
i'm sure you will agree

713
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,640
going remote especially for a full

714
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,559
workforce during you know the lockdown

715
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,799
phases in in whatever country

716
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,279
of course naturally introduced new

717
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,240
threats

718
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,000
new vulnerabilities

719
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,640
more phishing more scams more cyber

720
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,000
attacks

721
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,919
from your engineering background what

722
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,200
did you see

723
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,720
during this difficult time of lockdown

724
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,080
where everyone just had to work from

725
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,760
home

726
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,600
right this is so one

727
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,080
kind of tricky situation that i think a

728
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,440
lot of companies faced uh was that

729
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,039
you know

730
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,799
companies couldn't afford for the

731
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,480
business to stop like they needed to

732
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,640
ensure continuity

733
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,520
of operations and when people

734
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,039
went home

735
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,559
like there's always this question okay

736
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,559
so how are we going to enable everyone

737
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,679
to access that the tools the data

738
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,279
uh that they need to work on a

739
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,279
day-to-day basis and you can kind of do

740
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,240
that in a secure way or you can just

741
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,279
open it up uh to um like

742
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,960
very um

743
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,279
kind of public type of access just to

744
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,600
enable people to do their jobs but if

745
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,760
you're doing that in a way uh that

746
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,320
doesn't account for um

747
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
security and access control you're

748
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,120
opening up yourself to uh to a huge risk

749
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,279
so i think companies that

750
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,520
had a strong security story around

751
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,480
remote access in the past even if they

752
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,559
were not fully remote but had for

753
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,520
example

754
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,760
uh sales people that were like always on

755
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,960
the road and like did their uh homework

756
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,360
in allowing them to secure access i

757
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,600
think they had the foundation to uh

758
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,240
enable that enable that secure access uh

759
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,559
from the get-go uh and companies that

760
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,360
were sort of relying on

761
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,120
you know people being in an office and

762
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,080
treating

763
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,840
office and corporate network as the

764
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,000
security perimeter for the company like

765
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,640
they they were in for like a huge

766
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,000
readjustment

767
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,960
right so so i think uh it's um

768
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,559
like there were companies even though

769
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,720
that even those that were kind of more

770
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,600
traditionally um office bound so to

771
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
speak that were very well prepared from

772
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,559
a security and access management

773
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,279
perspective and i think this act this

774
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,159
sort of story around um we know who our

775
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,760
employees are we authenticate them

776
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,320
whenever they connect to whatever

777
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,440
corporate um tooling they need those

778
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,279
companies we're in a much better

779
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,120
position than you know companies that

780
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,640
were allowing anyone on their corporate

781
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,120
network to access uh things like

782
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,600
corporate intranet email and and and

783
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,240
things of that nature

784
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,880
that's great martin and lola or maria

785
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,039
how was your experience with with going

786
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,960
to fully remote because i'm sure you

787
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,080
were probably in the office prior

788
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,399
and yeah i i was on maternity leave when

789
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,679
it when it all happened so i came back

790
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,159
to a working environment and in a

791
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,600
previous company

792
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,440
that was extremely different

793
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,720
um and before joining time so i was

794
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,440
really really happy when i joined times

795
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,600
to know that our

796
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,120
view on where and how we work is up to

797
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,039
each individual employee

798
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,799
no one in times is going to sit and tell

799
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,159
you what your working week should look

800
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,960
like and we lead with trust and and that

801
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,760
was

802
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,919
a huge factor for me

803
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,159
and especially coming out of maternity

804
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,320
leave in particular so that's something

805
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,039
that we're finding is so vital we're

806
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,480
candidates they

807
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,039
not only is it like can i work from home

808
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,000
it is

809
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,720
how do you expect me to work how are you

810
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,120
monitoring me because so many

811
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,600
companies are either expecting people to

812
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,520
come back to an office

813
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,159
or they are like talking about hours or

814
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,799
how they monitor monitor them and people

815
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,399
have really gotten used to the

816
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,960
flexibility and and it's proven

817
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,279
that people can be successful companies

818
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,200
can be so successful we've been

819
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,360
incredibly successful all throughout the

820
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,880
pandemic which is amazing so there is no

821
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,200
concern around the productivity piece

822
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,520
and good candidates out there good cyber

823
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,320
security people know that and and the

824
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,480
companies that aren't looking at the

825
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,880
remote aspect and leading with trust i

826
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,080
feel are going to fall behind

827
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,840
yeah so i i would say that our

828
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,840
experience was a little different

829
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,760
but that's because um

830
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,559
we do work predominantly well we've

831
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,559
always been flexible so you could

832
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,480
usually always work

833
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,000
i mean if you work two or three days

834
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,760
from home before it wasn't too big a

835
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,480
deal

836
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
um people normally did at least two days

837
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,240
there were some teams that did more than

838
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,120
others

839
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,360
um we have our engineering team is

840
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,200
completely remote

841
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,679
so we've always worked in a flexible way

842
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,120
anyway

843
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,279
um

844
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,720
i think

845
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,880
remote based companies or remote first

846
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,799
companies have been growing um in

847
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,600
popularity anyway but when you join a

848
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,840
company knowing you're gonna be working

849
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,320
in an office then you make that

850
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
conscious choice for that and it's

851
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,960
because you do enjoy those face-to-face

852
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,320
interactions

853
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,399
um those physical and face-to-face

854
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,519
interactions um so i think for a lot of

855
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,799
our team

856
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,679
it was a shock a lot of people felt

857
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,279
isolated

858
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,519
um disconnected

859
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,760
um we had new starters and it's because

860
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,080
we didn't really i mean we tried but the

861
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,039
fact is we were never prepared to work

862
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,240
or on board people like this

863
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,480
and we just found that people weren't

864
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,080
actually

865
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,039
um engaged with our culture the way that

866
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,559
they used to be

867
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,480
um so there was a lot of learning

868
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,320
involved in terms of trying to turn

869
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,679
things around

870
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,840
but it was really hard work and

871
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,679
difficult to sustain

872
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,399
um now we're slowly kind of we're pretty

873
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,320
much back in the office now

874
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,720
and we encourage people to come in three

875
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,399
days a week if they're near an office

876
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,200
but they don't have to um so again it's

877
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,440
very much look we trust you you're

878
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,480
adults

879
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,080
you're gonna come in when whenever you

880
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,840
need to if you need to

881
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,440
and what we're finding is people are

882
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,600
choosing to come in on certain days when

883
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,960
they know they can collaborate with

884
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,399
other people

885
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,440
um

886
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,720
so that's what we're finding and

887
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,200
actually what we're seeing is people

888
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,440
just appreciating each other a little

889
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,799
bit more than they did before

890
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,799
and um yeah so for us we do like the

891
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,559
fact that there's flexibility and you

892
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,679
can choose when someone is remote

893
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,120
especially if they are in the same

894
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,279
country we try to get them to come to

895
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,399
the office

896
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,559
um on their first for the first couple

897
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,799
of days or so we cover the cost of that

898
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,519
but it's just to give them a sense of

899
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,840
you know silverfin identity so to speak

900
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,360
just that they attach

901
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,960
to more than the work they actually

902
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,799
attach to people

903
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,799
um and um

904
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,519
yeah the collaboration piece as well um

905
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,120
so it's been it's been an interesting

906
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,799
time for us and we're still working our

907
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,399
way through it

908
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,760
that's cool that's very cool if you've

909
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,039
got young children like myself then yeah

910
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,120
staying at home working from home and

911
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,960
managing those is a job in a job in

912
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,120
itself but yeah all good fun and games

913
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,799
now that's great thank you thank you all

914
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,039
so much for your answers um i hope it

915
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,679
was very valuable for our listeners and

916
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,239
our audience but let's um let's move on

917
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,879
to our next and in my opinion probably

918
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,960
the most important topic um based on our

919
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,159
discussion today which is diversity

920
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,119
and a question for all of you um and

921
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,399
please don't feel you need to answer

922
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,719
this in depth whatsoever i'm sure a lot

923
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,159
of our viewers and an audience have a

924
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,399
good understanding on this topic but in

925
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,520
your own words could you please describe

926
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
to me and the our audience what

927
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
diversity is

928
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,280
and if you believe

929
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,679
that there is a lack of diversity

930
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,119
within the tech industry

931
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,119
and we can start with maria

932
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,399
yeah absolutely um i mean sorry i was

933
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,159
nodding because when you said do we

934
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,079
believe this i was like yes yes it's

935
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,399
like shout out from the rooftops there

936
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,879
is and we should all be talking about it

937
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,560
every single

938
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,680
person in every tech org should have a

939
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,800
front of mind and i think that's where

940
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,160
we need to get to um i think there is a

941
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,320
general lack of diversity

942
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,200
in in tech in general but um as i said i

943
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,280
moved over from from tech

944
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
in general into into

945
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,160
a more cyber security focused um or and

946
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,280
from a ta perspective that is a struggle

947
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,400
and that is very very very clear that

948
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,520
there aren't um a huge range of diverse

949
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,760
candidates

950
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
ready to go like there are in other

951
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
companies they're there but companies

952
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,920
need to make a much more deliberate

953
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,040
effort

954
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,599
to go and source and find

955
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,520
um and to truly

956
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,359
truly put the effort behind it and i

957
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,680
think for me that's that's the biggest

958
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,920
piece and that's something that back to

959
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,480
my earlier statement about actions we we

960
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,119
have to lead with actions we have to be

961
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,000
really deliberate about how we do that

962
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,560
and i'll be really honest and i'm going

963
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,480
to make a bit of a statement here no one

964
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,640
has that right i i cannot think of a

965
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,119
company that is that i say they've got

966
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,760
it

967
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,800
they're sorted they understand it i mean

968
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,640
different companies do do well in

969
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,520
different areas but we in general have

970
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,880
such a ways to go and knowing that is is

971
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,920
a start

972
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,839
but man do we have to back it up with

973
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,240
actions

974
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,760
very nice and lola from your perspective

975
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,520
yeah i think um for me diversity um

976
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,240
comes in all shapes and forms so

977
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,040
we're talking about um you know your

978
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,839
background in terms of your ethnicity

979
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,560
we um sex um

980
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,880
it could be um

981
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,359
even just you know your style of

982
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,800
communication even uh it could be

983
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,320
um

984
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,200
yeah just so i i think one thing

985
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,119
that i do worry about when we do talk

986
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,880
about diversity like i think diversity

987
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,560
is very important

988
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,520
but

989
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,200
there are i think we first need to learn

990
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,000
what diversity tends to look like i mean

991
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,079
um i even saw a post on linkedin

992
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,119
yesterday

993
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,400
um about from someone at monzo and he

994
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,880
was saying that he um that we need to

995
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,440
also consider neurodiversity as well and

996
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,599
it's absolutely true and i think the

997
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,160
most important thing is one recognize

998
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
okay do we have

999
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,280
drones like or clones of people and if

1000
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,440
we do why is there a reason why that's

1001
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,359
important or we believe this to be

1002
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,880
important

1003
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,680
and how do we change this okay

1004
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,000
and then on top of that we say things

1005
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,040
like okay yeah we want to get people in

1006
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,200
but then that it doesn't stop there when

1007
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,240
you get people from diverse backgrounds

1008
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,160
into your business is your business

1009
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,880
ready for it is your is the culture of

1010
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,040
your team ready for it because what i

1011
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,320
often see is you hire people

1012
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,520
but you don't know how to interact with

1013
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,640
them you don't know how to perceive how

1014
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,040
they're communicating with you or you

1015
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,640
know perhaps you don't have the patience

1016
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,240
to work with them in the right way to

1017
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,040
perhaps train yourself etc and that that

1018
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,880
is at company level department level

1019
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,320
individual level

1020
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,280
um you know is it actually safe

1021
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,839
to be

1022
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,000
different that's you know do we create

1023
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,160
that kind of safety um

1024
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,680
so that's what one point and then i'd

1025
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,560
like to make a final point as well

1026
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,320
just regarding

1027
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
how we get more diversity so else

1028
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,359
outside of the you know perhaps the the

1029
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,920
traits that you can't see physically

1030
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,200
um i think we also need to consider that

1031
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,280
a lot of what people believe they can do

1032
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,599
starts from a very young age

1033
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,000
so how their parents raise them how

1034
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,920
their parents teach them the difference

1035
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,240
between boys and girls and how to react

1036
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,400
to things what they should be interested

1037
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,280
in etc like a lot of that is implanted

1038
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
from a very young age

1039
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,320
what do we or what do parents encourage

1040
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,480
their children to do right do you

1041
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,040
encourage your children to i don't know

1042
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,280
do ballet if they're a boy or to do

1043
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,200
sports if they're a girl like what what

1044
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,240
do you accept you know do you let them

1045
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,720
explore who they may be as well

1046
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,040
um and then on top of that i think we

1047
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,440
then also need to look at vulnerable

1048
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,160
communities as well what do we do to

1049
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,960
help them have access to these spaces as

1050
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,839
well

1051
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,440
um you know how do you let someone know

1052
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,119
let someone from a deprived community

1053
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,520
know that there is this cyber security

1054
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,560
space and actually you know how do they

1055
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,079
make that leap

1056
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,760
so i think there's there are lots of

1057
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,280
different buckets then there's a lot of

1058
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,440
work that proactive work that needs to

1059
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,839
be done

1060
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,880
that's great lola thank you so much um

1061
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,560
martin diego would you like to say a few

1062
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,040
words on on diversity and

1063
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,480
and yeah leave this

1064
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,400
yeah please go ahead yeah

1065
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,880
so i mean lola pretty much in a very

1066
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,520
elegant way uh said everything that was

1067
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,599
in my brain but i will try to add that

1068
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,040
in uh yeah so the first thing will be

1069
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,960
mentioning that depending who you ask

1070
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,480
about what diversity is right you

1071
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,280
probably get different answers because

1072
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,079
um also because of the society or the

1073
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,920
specific country what you see you may

1074
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,800
get

1075
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,040
if you ask someone what is what is

1076
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,599
diversity they may focus on women or

1077
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,000
they may mention the specific race or

1078
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,800
they may or a specific minority so

1079
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,119
that's one thing and meeting from spain

1080
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,359
having worked there by being 12 years in

1081
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,200
california in the us

1082
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,040
and that's especially

1083
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,480
especially true

1084
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,680
so

1085
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,720
so yeah one thing is is understanding

1086
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,200
what diversity is right or that it just

1087
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,520
doesn't stop at the specific thing that

1088
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,960
maybe is more

1089
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,520
relevant so to speak or more common in

1090
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,599
in your specific country because it goes

1091
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,880
beyond that

1092
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,960
lg tv community for example that we

1093
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,560
haven't mentioned that's that's another

1094
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,520
one right uh lola mentioned very great

1095
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,440
the company and it's also to be ready

1096
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,040
for that there is

1097
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,119
if you just uh start to make an effort

1098
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,800
to maybe target

1099
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,520
your your open roles or like try to give

1100
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,400
opportunities for minorities or whatever

1101
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,960
it is let's just say minorities as in a

1102
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,839
in a global

1103
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,200
sense uh and the company is not ready

1104
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,880
you are not gonna succeed you're gonna

1105
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,040
fail because that person

1106
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,119
and that's not that's not on that person

1107
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,240
specific

1108
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,800
the rest of the company needs also to be

1109
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,920
uh to be on point for that so to speak

1110
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,200
um

1111
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,760
then for example in my case when you

1112
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,960
also mentioned

1113
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,200
is there is a diversity in cyber

1114
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,599
security i mean i just have

1115
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,280
obviously we need to go to the official

1116
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,280
data but when i go to security

1117
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,000
conference and i look around

1118
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,319
the pattern is clear it's it's white

1119
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,880
males right so i i from my personal

1120
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,960
perspective definitely there is a lack

1121
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,800
of diversity i just need to look around

1122
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,640
being in conference of thousands of

1123
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,839
people and there is i think no question

1124
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,640
in the value of adding diversity to any

1125
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,280
industry but uh you know

1126
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
from every perspective races

1127
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,560
nationalities sex religion everything

1128
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,040
else i i think there is no question

1129
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,800
about that so we should definitely work

1130
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,400
on that and then i will just just

1131
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,880
mention specific between the spaying and

1132
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,720
in the u.s specifically for me for

1133
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,280
example in san francisco

1134
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,520
the weird the the rare thing will be

1135
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,400
that in a company i talk to the same

1136
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,040
nationality so here in san francisco

1137
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,119
when it comes to nationalities it's

1138
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,440
pretty diverse but that doesn't mean

1139
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,760
that it's the same case in cyber

1140
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,000
security for example for races or for

1141
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,880
lgbt community so for example here the

1142
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,119
nationality diversity wouldn't be so

1143
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,800
much of a problem again from my own

1144
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,119
experience as a weight calculation you

1145
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,079
know but it will be maybe

1146
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,000
a problem for diversity when it comes to

1147
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,200
two different races for example so so it

1148
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,280
is definitely something that

1149
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,040
we need to understand what diversity is

1150
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,440
and that's why um

1151
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,520
ravioli was such a such a good question

1152
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,119
that you asked that what is actual

1153
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,480
diversity

1154
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,800
thank you thank you martin and and thank

1155
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,319
you for that answer so

1156
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,280
maria

1157
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,040
marie you mentioned

1158
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,200
actions actions actions which i thought

1159
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,960
was great and

1160
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,000
lola mentioned education from from

1161
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,359
childhood

1162
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,680
so what what if you could you describe

1163
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,119
to me what you believe that

1164
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,640
organizations

1165
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,800
in today's day and age can what they can

1166
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,440
do to improve diversity

1167
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,520
where it will actually have a positive

1168
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,640
impact

1169
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,720
on talent acquisition

1170
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,079
and you can see what i'm trying to do

1171
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,599
i'm trying to link the two with

1172
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,520
diversity and talent acquisition so what

1173
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,359
do you believe organizations can do

1174
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,400
better

1175
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,920
to ensure that we

1176
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,520
achieve diversity the way it should be

1177
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,839
achieved

1178
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,920
sorry

1179
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,440
uh yeah i think one thing that i see um

1180
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,960
with a lot of teams is quite often

1181
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,920
um

1182
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,240
we tend to promote

1183
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,280
good

1184
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,760
individual contributors to team leads

1185
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,680
and managers right

1186
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,200
and

1187
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,160
that's fine but if that person doesn't

1188
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,720
have the right kind of people skills to

1189
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,720
understand how to kind of manage you

1190
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,319
know different people that could be an

1191
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,319
issue so i think

1192
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,880
the when when you are promoting someone

1193
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,319
when they are climbing up the ladder and

1194
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,440
they have more responsibility um there

1195
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,599
needs to be some training and coaching

1196
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,520
that goes along with that and i think

1197
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,440
before that promotion even happens they

1198
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,680
need to already be demonstrating those

1199
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,720
traits

1200
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,040
and that's something that really

1201
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,880
from what i've seen anyway

1202
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,800
um doesn't really tend to happen um

1203
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,680
maybe someone will do a managerial track

1204
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,599
training course but that's it okay

1205
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,359
you've ticked a box okay then you're a

1206
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,000
great manager no it's not that simple so

1207
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,160
i think there needs to be a much more

1208
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,000
intensive way of actually looking and

1209
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,720
measuring that

1210
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,040
i think another thing that

1211
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,560
companies can do as well is just

1212
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,839
generally so for instance

1213
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,800
do general training across the business

1214
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,400
so what is diversity why is it important

1215
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,319
how what what kind of things should you

1216
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,319
avoid saying or how should you avoid

1217
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,640
speaking about different people so i

1218
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,280
think if we can have conversations um

1219
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,119
training and conversations around that

1220
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,800
because we don't want that to be a

1221
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,040
one-way conversation but there should be

1222
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,359
a two-way dialogue around that i think

1223
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,920
that will help people um understand and

1224
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,359
learn and when they're hearing the

1225
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,599
experiences of perhaps a colleague or a

1226
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,839
counterpart then it becomes more real

1227
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:50,800
for them

1228
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,920
um i mean what i have seen happen is you

1229
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,200
know yes you find let's say for the sake

1230
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,040
of this argument you find um a a female

1231
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,359
who is willing to join the engineering

1232
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,319
team

1233
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,920
she's there for a few months and then

1234
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,760
leaves why because people don't

1235
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,079
communicate effectively with her perhaps

1236
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,319
they're not listening to her when she's

1237
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,720
giving feedback on hey i find this a

1238
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,599
little bit offensive right so um i think

1239
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,240
it's just we just need a little bit more

1240
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,760
um

1241
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,960
empathy

1242
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,040
and to just take the time to understand

1243
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,599
people as individuals as well um so not

1244
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,920
just on work topics but actually spend

1245
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,000
some time with this person so you get a

1246
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,400
better understanding of who they are and

1247
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,920
why they think the way that they do so

1248
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,680
that when you are collaborating work

1249
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,560
wise

1250
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,839
there's a little bit more understanding

1251
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,800
there understood and uh sorry maria

1252
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,400
i was going to take the floor but

1253
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,720
do you think that what lola described

1254
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,680
there would encourage more women and you

1255
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,960
know the lgbtq community to join

1256
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,520
maybe the tech industry or any industry

1257
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,680
for the long term

1258
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,920
yeah i mean it

1259
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,839
what lola was was talking about there is

1260
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,880
is absolutely vital but also i was you

1261
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,200
really triggered something with me in in

1262
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,359
the general conversation

1263
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,640
i feel like that is often missed that

1264
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,400
like i know i talked about actions and i

1265
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,000
believe in bringing in like bias

1266
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,559
training and diversity training and then

1267
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,880
following it up but it's also been in a

1268
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,520
safe space to talk about it so we might

1269
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,480
have managers um or people that think

1270
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,400
oh i don't know how to bring this up but

1271
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,160
i'm a little bit worried about the

1272
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,680
balance on my team whether that be

1273
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,119
gender whether that be people of color

1274
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,880
whether that be race or sexual

1275
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,680
orientation what whatever it is but but

1276
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,280
it's also

1277
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,760
sometimes it's a blue subject so it's

1278
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,839
really really important that we we talk

1279
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,160
about it more we talk about it and from

1280
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,920
a leadership perspective in any kind of

1281
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,480
all hands that we that we bring it into

1282
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,400
every conversation that we bring it into

1283
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,240
our performance reviews

1284
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,559
and we bring it into our employee

1285
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,359
surveys we ask people if they feel like

1286
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,720
they're safe if they feel like they are

1287
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,960
included and and to start touching on

1288
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,000
the word inclusivity which is really

1289
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,800
really important i feel like diversity

1290
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,319
was the topic

1291
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,240
10 years ago that we were talking about

1292
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,480
just like women in business was 10 years

1293
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,000
ago i feel like we need to start

1294
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,839
thinking about that

1295
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:22,240
inclusivity and how people feel on a

1296
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,319
day-to-day basis we talked about how

1297
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,119
people are working from home is there a

1298
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,720
joke on a zoom call that makes them

1299
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,920
uncomfortable because they're but

1300
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,520
they're not in the office so they let it

1301
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,240
go

1302
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,400
like we need to bring in that culture of

1303
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,119
open dialogue so that people feel safe

1304
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,440
and can talk about it more and that in

1305
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,960
itself will lead to more actions

1306
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,720
that's great thank you maria martin hot

1307
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,559
would you have anything to add just

1308
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,400
before we maybe then move on to our next

1309
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,760
topic

1310
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,119
yes so like i wanted to reiterate that

1311
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,280
uh leadership at every level plays like

1312
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,920
a crucial role in that and

1313
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,200
as as companies grow i think a lot of um

1314
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,359
kind of is set by the early leadership

1315
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,280
uh because as little i mentioned there

1316
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,240
are

1317
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,319
great employees who later on become team

1318
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,280
leaders and managers but um i think

1319
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,359
every time that that happens they kind

1320
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,760
of grow into that role in a particular

1321
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,160
context of the company so if there

1322
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,079
there's lack of uh

1323
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,400
diversity and inclusion company culture

1324
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,079
at that point

1325
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,280
it's very hard to like build that next

1326
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,359
generation of leaders that will instill

1327
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,559
that culture

1328
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:33,359
um

1329
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,119
and like

1330
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,680
there's tons of work to be done both for

1331
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,440
like enhancing

1332
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,160
the existing structures like teams

1333
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,760
departments and also encouraging and

1334
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,839
um teaching that new generation of

1335
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,440
leaders that um

1336
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,119
that this is super important and

1337
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,119
teaching them how to do that how to

1338
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,520
listen to people how to coach their team

1339
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,720
members to uh be

1340
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,280
sort of more more open and

1341
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,559
uh

1342
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,359
behave in a way that does not pull uh

1343
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,920
pull people off um and one other thing

1344
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,960
is that um like i think to tie back to

1345
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,880
the talent acquisition part

1346
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,200
is that the interview process is like

1347
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,240
super critical because this is when

1348
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,359
when candidates talk to their future

1349
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,640
boss their future peers and uh if you

1350
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,280
want to bring in more diverse talent

1351
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,440
this is this is sort of how you show off

1352
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,920
this is this is where you show that

1353
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,720
uh you know this this workplace is safe

1354
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,880
for them to join so i think this is this

1355
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,400
is super critical so when it comes to

1356
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,319
training i think it's not only for

1357
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,559
managers it's for

1358
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,440
everyone who's kind of involved in that

1359
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,000
interview process

1360
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,559
that's great mason thank you so much and

1361
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,079
and of course i guess it's one of those

1362
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,359
topics where we could probably just

1363
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,599
spend all day over a meal talking about

1364
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,200
and with different opinions and

1365
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,480
different experiences and backgrounds

1366
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,400
but no thank you ever so much

1367
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,040
um so that leads me on to um

1368
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,760
kicking off our final topic which is

1369
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,280
retention

1370
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,720
so from my my perspective retention is

1371
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,200
how do organizations essentially retain

1372
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,520
or keep their employees

1373
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,119
and based on your background and

1374
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,200
experience once again

1375
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,400
could you please

1376
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,359
tell us

1377
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,760
or you and the audience

1378
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,839
what are the challenges

1379
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,720
in recruiting and retaining people in

1380
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,160
general

1381
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,839
based on your experience at your current

1382
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,839
organization

1383
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,839
and we can start with martin bieger

1384
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,839
all right i was taking notes here

1385
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,319
because i have really bad memory so i

1386
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,800
mean it relates a little bit to the

1387
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,480
previous question that we had around how

1388
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,960
we actually get people in in first place

1389
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,599
right and i personally talked about the

1390
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,920
the aspect of the flexibility and being

1391
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,319
able to research and stuff going beyond

1392
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,400
that once you are at the company how can

1393
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,640
we make sure you don't leave i mean the

1394
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,640
obvious one i will start with is a

1395
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,280
career path right you probably people

1396
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,280
doesn't want to get it depends because

1397
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,680
sometimes there is people that they they

1398
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,359
got to a good place they like the job

1399
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,040
that they do and sometimes

1400
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,960
there's this joke that a you know as

1401
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,280
soon as someone does his job really

1402
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,200
really well you promote him and change

1403
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,200
him from that job or maybe it's actually

1404
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,280
not a great idea because then you set

1405
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,440
him up for failure if he's doing a great

1406
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,280
job there and he's happy there just it's

1407
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,640
fine keeping their

1408
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,079
in i mean

1409
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,720
from the monetary perspective obviously

1410
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,319
you should still be motivating that

1411
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,960
person right but maybe promotion is not

1412
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,200
always the best path of course that the

1413
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,559
employee needs to choose that but i

1414
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,800
think a strong

1415
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,680
solid clear career path is is a is the

1416
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,359
way to retain someone because um

1417
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,359
usually like here

1418
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,359
in silicon valley right

1419
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,280
because there is so much demand

1420
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,000
especially in cyber security the joke is

1421
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,200
hey

1422
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,720
just if you don't like your boss look

1423
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,559
for another boss rather than you know

1424
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,559
look for another job and stuff you can

1425
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,200
you can you have really a strong hand if

1426
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,040
you are in cybersecurity in silicon

1427
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,359
valley because there is so much demand

1428
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:18,079
and

1429
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,160
so many cool companies so many cool

1430
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,280
products

1431
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,440
to work on so retention is really

1432
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,319
difficult so and it goes beyond giving

1433
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:29,280
free lunches massages at the chairs

1434
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,200
those are all good and you get that at

1435
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,680
the big companies right but

1436
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,480
i think a a strong career path is one

1437
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,559
again flexibility especially an

1438
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,079
understanding that the company shows

1439
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,319
that understands that we've coveted

1440
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,400
things have changed things have changed

1441
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,680
and i i definitely understand

1442
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,400
maria's point and lola's point that that

1443
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,480
they have different experiences and it

1444
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,319
is a challenge for everyone

1445
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,319
i'm just saying that we cannot ignore it

1446
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,640
so a company that

1447
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,160
that gives you

1448
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,200
um

1449
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,119
facilitates a little bit of transition

1450
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,559
if it needs to be back to the office

1451
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,640
because not everyone has a job that can

1452
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,960
do remote right if you work on on

1453
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,599
servers you need to be on on the server

1454
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,920
rack fix that so

1455
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,640
so

1456
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,760
that's another thing like the

1457
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,680
flexibility and understanding and giving

1458
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,920
tools for people to slowly transition

1459
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,839
back to what it used to be if they have

1460
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,119
to or even be open to to remote work i

1461
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,599
think i will stop at those two because

1462
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,440
i'm sure the the rest of the panelists

1463
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,520
have others to add but for me those two

1464
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,839
are very important

1465
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,079
that's great martin thank you lola maria

1466
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,119
would you like to add anything to that

1467
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,000
yeah just as martin was was talking what

1468
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,400
struck me is i i loved your point about

1469
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,160
the massages and all that kind of stuff

1470
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,920
because again

1471
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,559
i if i look back five or six years in

1472
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,319
horror and and talent acquisition we

1473
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,160
were we were striving to bring in all

1474
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,319
that stuff and now that stuff is

1475
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,880
standard right so so you have to not

1476
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,640
only compete with the standard stuff but

1477
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,200
you have to really understand what

1478
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,839
people want on a very personal level and

1479
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,520
something that has

1480
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,839
come up quite a lot recently is a voice

1481
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,520
and a seat at the table

1482
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,359
and i think that's

1483
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:15,359
a new thing that people are looking for

1484
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,680
and and listen it's great for us we're

1485
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,599
we're a start-up on an incredible

1486
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,480
product

1487
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,880
people are interested and then we give

1488
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,799
them the opportunity at the size that we

1489
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,440
are and hopefully as we grow to continue

1490
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,680
to have a voice so constantly getting

1491
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,839
feedback not just on the day-to-day

1492
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,240
stuff but on the product on on the

1493
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,880
mission on the goals on where we're

1494
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,119
going and and getting that feedback

1495
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,000
constantly from the teams so that

1496
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,160
everybody feels part of the journey and

1497
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,079
that's something that we're really

1498
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,960
really striving to do well here because

1499
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,680
that is a differentiator it's no longer

1500
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,760
the snacks because well we're not in an

1501
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,400
office or well we are part-time but it

1502
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,640
it's no longer that it's no longer the

1503
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,599
dinners at google and it it's more than

1504
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,839
that and it's really that self-worth

1505
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,319
and what we're hearing a lot of is that

1506
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,839
voice on the seat at the table and

1507
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,839
getting getting hurt we're not always

1508
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,520
going to agree but people want the

1509
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,160
debate and cyber security people in

1510
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,880
general love a good debate so it's

1511
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,559
really really great to bring them in and

1512
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,559
that's something there's loads of other

1513
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,319
stuff but that's something i'm seeing as

1514
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,119
a key differentiator at the moment

1515
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,520
yeah i i completely agree with maria i

1516
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,960
think

1517
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,280
really understanding what is important

1518
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,040
to the people within that business or

1519
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,960
that organization or that team is the

1520
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,280
first way to go again you can't make

1521
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,680
everyone happy but at least being able

1522
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,920
to understand what on the top line is

1523
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,000
important to people

1524
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,319
and i think

1525
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,559
generally people want to know that you

1526
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,960
are willing to invest in them

1527
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,480
so whether that's

1528
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,520
uh in in the view of a career path and i

1529
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,040
think the wonderful wonderful thing

1530
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,839
about tech and engineering in general is

1531
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,520
that they're always these two parts

1532
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,920
right so specialist and managerial so

1533
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,160
there is the opportunity to do um either

1534
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,040
one of the two and still earn very well

1535
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,240
um but even where you don't have that

1536
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,760
seeing that the company is growing

1537
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,520
enough that there's always going to be

1538
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,160
an opportunity to move into something

1539
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,079
or perhaps work on another feature or

1540
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,760
something like that

1541
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,559
so

1542
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:24,400
it's really more about being able to do

1543
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,839
something new learning new skills

1544
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,160
stretch yourself in a new way

1545
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,640
i think another way is definitely more

1546
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,680
around

1547
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,359
policy

1548
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,920
than the perks so

1549
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,799
for instance if you want women to join

1550
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,319
your organization what does your

1551
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,640
maternity policy look like

1552
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,280
like do you actually have one that

1553
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,359
will support her

1554
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:49,200
in her first year

1555
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,760
and so that she feels like okay i can

1556
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,720
actually

1557
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,400
come back to work because i've been

1558
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,720
given enough time or my partner and i've

1559
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,119
been given enough time with our new baby

1560
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,520
um and you know when they do come back

1561
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,280
to work how are they supported when they

1562
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,440
come back so i think it's really looking

1563
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,319
at those

1564
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,200
policies that help people balance what

1565
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,680
they want to do personally

1566
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,240
with what they want to do career-wise

1567
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,839
and quite often

1568
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,319
people have to choose particularly women

1569
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,000
have to choose between the two just

1570
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,920
because they're not getting the support

1571
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,520
that they need

1572
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,440
whether it's during that period or when

1573
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,359
they get back and again this can look

1574
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,359
very different for different people

1575
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,359
but i think it's just ensuring that we

1576
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:33,359
really invest in people whether it's

1577
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,680
training policies etc and we support

1578
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,559
them

1579
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,599
um based on what their personalized

1580
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,280
needs are

1581
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,720
well that's that's great that's great

1582
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,559
thank you thank you so much

1583
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,319
something i've come across

1584
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:47,839
pretty much every organization i've

1585
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:51,680
worked at is employee survey questions

1586
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,480
and in all honesty without

1587
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,400
no disrespect to any organization i work

1588
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,280
for

1589
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,200
i personally have never really seen the

1590
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,880
value of that maybe because i've never

1591
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,839
stayed at a company long enough

1592
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,400
however

1593
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,599
in your opinion how valuable are these

1594
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,680
employee survey questions to boost

1595
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,160
retention and is there a real value in

1596
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,920
actually doing so because i'm sure we've

1597
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,040
all come across one before

1598
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,760
yeah i think that's sorry

1599
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,440
yeah i definitely think there's value

1600
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,440
there i think um

1601
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,599
depending on the type of organization

1602
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:26,880
and business that you have but

1603
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,240
especially with us

1604
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,720
being more remote now in general it's a

1605
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,240
great way to get an understanding of

1606
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,079
what people are thinking

1607
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,839
especially because a lot of the feedback

1608
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,720
is anonymous and the surveys now also

1609
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,359
look at things like well-being

1610
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,599
as well as how they're feeling about the

1611
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,440
company and their role

1612
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,319
i think where it's a waste of time is

1613
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:51,200
you have all that valuable information

1614
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,160
um

1615
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,079
and you do nothing with it i think

1616
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,160
that's where actually it can be

1617
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,480
dangerous and detrimental because

1618
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,640
people just think okay what are we doing

1619
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,960
this for if you're not actually going to

1620
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,040
solve these key issues that keep on

1621
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,079
coming up

1622
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,480
so i think when you do these types of

1623
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,799
surveys you need to truly be ready to

1624
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:11,760
act

1625
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,160
not just you know hey yeah we hear you

1626
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,480
that's nice see you next month that kind

1627
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,000
of thing

1628
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,520
yeah you have to um it can backfire when

1629
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,640
you don't i've seen it backfire when to

1630
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,319
the point raj about

1631
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,559
they roll them out you answer honestly

1632
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,960
you're sitting you're waiting and then

1633
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,640
they'll they'll come out with you know

1634
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,160
here's the top three things we're

1635
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,960
focusing on and they don't resonate

1636
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,280
remotely with what you or any of your

1637
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,079
colleagues wrote down and i think that's

1638
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,760
the key point i think if you're doing

1639
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,520
them you have to hold yourself

1640
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,920
accountable and back to the transparency

1641
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,480
piece of sharing every piece of data in

1642
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,920
that obviously if there's something

1643
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,160
really sensitive in in those open-ended

1644
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,720
questions you can't but it's just so so

1645
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,839
important

1646
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:00,160
to be a transparent and the other thing

1647
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,440
about them is

1648
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,599
they're they are very useful but there's

1649
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,280
also other ways to do them on a regular

1650
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,119
basis like we we have bi-weekly town

1651
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,960
halls we're going to have one after this

1652
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,200
there's a question box or there's a

1653
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,640
comment box we're gonna have a

1654
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,760
suggestion

1655
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,920
box virtually in slack at some point as

1656
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,799
well

1657
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,040
just to keep it regular because often

1658
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,839
those

1659
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:20,799
um

1660
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:23,599
the surveys are once a year and

1661
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,760
i mean by that point people could be

1662
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,119
talking to other companies if there's

1663
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:28,799
something that's bothering them so it's

1664
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:30,799
more about that regular open

1665
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,200
transparency and getting feedback from

1666
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,559
the the teams on a regular basis

1667
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,640
that's great thank you and um martian

1668
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,160
hop i think we've just got time for one

1669
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,680
more question before we open the floor

1670
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,720
for q a but martin hop from from your

1671
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,559
opinion in your opinion and from your

1672
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,720
perspective what do you believe

1673
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,799
organizations can do more

1674
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:53,440
um in order to retain employees

1675
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,839
especially in such a fast-paced evolving

1676
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,440
industry that we work in which is the

1677
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,559
tech industry or even cyber security

1678
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,680
right so if i were to pick one thing um

1679
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,760
because i would actually pick one thing

1680
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,440
that the companies shouldn't do or

1681
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,079
should do something to avoid that and

1682
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,520
that is maybe something we don't talk

1683
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,359
about enough in the cyber security

1684
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:16,319
industry but that is burnout so i i have

1685
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,760
witnessed that there are companies that

1686
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,520
are trying to build their

1687
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,520
cyber security

1688
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,079
teams and departments but

1689
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,160
given the for example amount of like

1690
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,799
ransomware attacks that they're facing

1691
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:30,960
and like constant fire drills and

1692
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,280
security incidents like

1693
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,520
those environments are burning people

1694
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,000
out and this is um where we want it or

1695
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,079
not like if people have

1696
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:41,039
um

1697
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,960
the choice between

1698
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,640
a challenging environment where they can

1699
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,240
focus on an interesting technical

1700
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,160
problem versus fighting fires all day

1701
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,200
long

1702
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,960
like guess which company they're going

1703
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,760
to choose um so

1704
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,559
like trying to avoid environments where

1705
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,880
um you know people are under-resourced

1706
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,559
overworked

1707
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,440
and burdened with tasks that uh they're

1708
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,000
not realistically able to carry out i

1709
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,359
think that's a

1710
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,920
a very common uh problem the cyber

1711
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,760
security industry so if you want to

1712
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,480
retain our engineers let's try not to do

1713
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,480
that or to do whatever is humanely

1714
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,920
possible to avoid people burning out

1715
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,359
now that's great thank you thank you

1716
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,920
martin for that um so yeah thank you to

1717
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,960
all our panelists for their

1718
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,039
contributions so far just being courtesy

1719
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:28,319
of time

1720
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:30,319
we are now open to questions from our

1721
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:32,160
audience and it looks like i have two

1722
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,640
already um so for our panelists we'll go

1723
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,119
with the first question which is

1724
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,280
it looks like nowadays people move

1725
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,160
companies every two or three years

1726
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,720
um oh that question seemed to

1727
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,960
seem to disappear

1728
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,720
apologies uh it should have been

1729
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,598
answered right

1730
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,440
sorry you seen it

1731
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,520
yeah sorry i think someone marked it as

1732
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,520
a answer oh it looks already answered

1733
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,359
okay that's fine that's time no problem

1734
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,359
we'll move on to the next question no no

1735
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:03,680
go ahead no go ahead use this one no it

1736
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,119
was just a technical issue i think

1737
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,960
someone just clicked it was answered but

1738
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,160
it's not so

1739
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,240
sorry go ahead no problem so i'll go

1740
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,160
ahead so it looks like nowadays people

1741
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,359
move companies every two or three years

1742
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,520
what are your opinions about that is

1743
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,079
that an issue

1744
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:22,960
i yeah i'll take that and i worked with

1745
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,960
a manager years and years ago who had a

1746
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,440
real issue with that and would

1747
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,559
immediately look at it at a cv and go no

1748
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,440
i want loyalty and those days are gone

1749
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,280
like those days are gone and in this

1750
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,760
space they're non-existent so i don't

1751
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,280
think we should be scared of it and to

1752
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,359
the earlier question about attrition

1753
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:42,799
there should be a healthy level of

1754
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,039
attrition and people should be moving on

1755
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,200
and companies should be happy for those

1756
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,119
that are going on to a better position

1757
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:51,200
and learning from it and pinching

1758
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,079
themselves as their top talent but but i

1759
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:55,839
don't think we should look at it as a

1760
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,599
problem i think we should

1761
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,960
look at it as

1762
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,520
as the way the world and also then

1763
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,280
not judge the person for it when they

1764
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,200
come through on our applicant management

1765
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,960
systems

1766
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,280
what i will what i will add to that is

1767
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,440
um i mentioned before having a clear

1768
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,400
career path and ideally that will be

1769
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,920
going up right but sometimes you need to

1770
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,480
go in zigzag unfortunately which is the

1771
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,400
job hopping which is like okay i need to

1772
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,319
change careers if i want a bigger

1773
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,720
opportunity for that so

1774
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,799
it is a problem but the companies also

1775
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:29,119
need to learn the why it could be

1776
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:31,520
probably also as well

1777
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,440
the case is i just want to go after

1778
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,359
money so if i change three companies i

1779
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:37,520
get a new refresher here in silicon

1780
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,440
valley you get stocks for four years so

1781
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,760
you get the cliff and all that stuff but

1782
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,240
it is also a matter sometimes an issue

1783
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,520
with the promotions with the career path

1784
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,520
and sometimes you also get bored of the

1785
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,680
product in technology there is just so

1786
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,119
much stuff now you're working on

1787
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,839
autonomous cars and then you switch to

1788
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,760
go to rockets that and now there are so

1789
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,079
many private companies and then you go

1790
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:02,319
work for uh you know

1791
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,400
the department of defense or cia because

1792
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,319
you want to do more spy stuff there is

1793
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,200
so much exciting stuff to work on that

1794
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,640
uh it it shouldn't come to a surprise as

1795
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,480
maria was mentioning that

1796
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,079
we kind of look at it as oh this person

1797
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,559
is not loyal

1798
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,440
lola martin would you like to add

1799
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,640
anything before we move to the next

1800
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,960
question

1801
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,280
oh yeah no sorry good go go ahead lola

1802
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,559
i think it really depends because

1803
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,640
how many jobs over what period of time i

1804
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,680
mean

1805
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,280
i think it depends i think if the person

1806
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,960
is a consultant then it's expected

1807
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,640
is it two years or is it a year and a

1808
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,799
half like i will look at the months to

1809
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,799
see like what's happening is there a

1810
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,880
pattern does that mean you're gone in a

1811
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,480
year and a half and it really depends on

1812
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,640
what i need from that person and how i

1813
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,280
how long i see that lasting for as well

1814
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,799
so i think it really depends on the

1815
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:58,079
environment but

1816
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,920
i think two to three years is pretty

1817
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,240
normal now to be honest

1818
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,359
um

1819
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:06,480
so yeah

1820
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,480
sorry martin

1821
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,400
yeah i just want to say it's uh like i

1822
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,640
observe is the same reality to someone

1823
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,480
changing their jobs two every two three

1824
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,640
years that's perfectly normal these days

1825
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,200
so i i personally and this is like kind

1826
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,039
of my past experience as a hiring

1827
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,359
manager i never saw that as a red flag

1828
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,680
like if someone changed jobs every six

1829
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,319
months then yes probably but also it's

1830
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,319
also something um as though i mentioned

1831
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:33,039
to to look into because maybe that uh

1832
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,119
person was an independent consultant but

1833
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,520
in which case is perfectly normal so

1834
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,240
uh yes it's just i guess the reality

1835
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,760
right now no

1836
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,000
very few people work um

1837
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,960
in a lifetime at a single company which

1838
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,400
would happen before it's just not a

1839
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,160
thing

1840
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,920
okay that's great and we've got one more

1841
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,119
question here

1842
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:55,599
which is what would be some tips that

1843
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,079
you have for one-on-one meetings both

1844
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,839
for managers and

1845
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:02,240
ics forgive me my acronyms are not the

1846
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,280
best but

1847
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,680
i think it's individual contributors is

1848
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,160
it well that must be it must be

1849
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,558
yes it's good

1850
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:17,839
would you like to answer that one

1851
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:20,238
um yeah absolutely so

1852
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:22,640
i'll tell you what i do with my team

1853
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,679
i mean it really depends on um i think

1854
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:27,520
your space the place at which you work

1855
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,880
the amount of work

1856
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,359
everyone has and the seniority of the

1857
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,880
people in your team

1858
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,198
um i think firstly regular one-to-ones

1859
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:37,120
are super helpful even if it's just as a

1860
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,279
way to connect so i try to do

1861
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:41,198
one-to-ones with my team

1862
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:43,759
uh once a week i try to do it at the

1863
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,920
beginning of the week to kind of kick us

1864
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,158
off the right way i have done other days

1865
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:49,120
as well

1866
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,040
um i think it's really just finding out

1867
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,719
what works for you and your team you

1868
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,719
don't have to be rigid about how you do

1869
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,479
what you do

1870
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,719
we talk about generally how the previous

1871
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:02,238
week went um i usually have an idea on

1872
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,158
uh what their key projects are so it's

1873
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:07,040
really to see okay what does progress

1874
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,880
looks look like

1875
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,080
what's holding you back in any area

1876
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,880
and then we also talk about

1877
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,799
achievements as well

1878
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:20,000
any areas that are particular challenges

1879
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,238
um and that's what we work on so those

1880
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,158
are the regular one-to-ones

1881
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:26,319
i then try to do monthly

1882
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,960
one-to-ones again it depends uh but as a

1883
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,359
minimum quarterly where we look over a

1884
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,000
period of time okay how has this been

1885
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,120
overall

1886
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,158
um

1887
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:37,120
and

1888
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,799
is there progress from what we saw

1889
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,158
before

1890
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:42,399
um and i think it's those particularly

1891
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:44,238
the quarterly ones where we then really

1892
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:45,839
talk about the job itself how are you

1893
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,238
finding things

1894
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:49,600
is this still interesting to you is

1895
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,198
there anything else you need to learn

1896
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:53,520
what additional support do you need

1897
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,199
so those are some of the things that i i

1898
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,400
tend to personally touch on

1899
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,800
anyone else from the panel

1900
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,679
i would just add to um for individual

1901
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,159
contributors to be brave and ask

1902
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:10,400
questions of their manager i've seen it

1903
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,239
so many times where

1904
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,840
individual contributors think that their

1905
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,760
one-to-ones are you know the space for

1906
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,840
them to come and give updates but but

1907
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,000
really that the value is that two-way

1908
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,600
conversation

1909
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,360
so and for individual contributors

1910
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,199
listening and and for managers for their

1911
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,520
managers actually in fact and we all

1912
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,440
everyone has a manager at some point it

1913
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,600
is really really important to kind of

1914
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,920
respectfully challenge and ask questions

1915
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,520
in those one-to-ones because that's

1916
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,960
where the true value lies

1917
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,800
any of our martians would like to maybe

1918
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,520
add something finally yeah i will just

1919
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,440
i will just mention that i had kind of

1920
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,840
the two styles over over the different

1921
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,800
jobs that i had i wasn't job hopping so

1922
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,760
just in case i mentioned that but

1923
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,600
i i had several jobs so i had the

1924
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,640
managers that used it more as uh as uh

1925
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,239
give me an update of what you've been

1926
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,640
working on and i have managers that was

1927
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,040
this is your time we can talk about

1928
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,679
soccer or we can talk about a job but

1929
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:11,760
this is a connection time and i like the

1930
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,120
second one because uh we have stand-ups

1931
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,800
to give updates right there with the

1932
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,800
rest of the team and stuff but i really

1933
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,000
like that half an hour a week or every

1934
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,560
two weeks which i can literally sit down

1935
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,880
with my manager and just talk about

1936
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,480
whatever i want

1937
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,159
because then that's kind of like a safe

1938
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,880
space if i want to talk about

1939
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,120
you know something that is not going as

1940
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,920
i want it to go at work or stuff but i

1941
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,480
can just also tell him about personal

1942
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,360
concerns that may be affecting my job or

1943
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,960
just in general about something that i

1944
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,480
want to share with him because i have a

1945
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,960
great relationship with my manager so

1946
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,640
in that sense the one-on-ones are

1947
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,560
valuable to me that time that i can just

1948
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,120
really talk about anyone and as one of

1949
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,480
my managers

1950
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,239
used to say this is your time we can do

1951
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,960
whatever you want so and we actually

1952
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,280
used to go for walks

1953
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,360
which is also cool like it's it's a

1954
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,040
different experience when you are

1955
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,520
walking than sitting in an office so i

1956
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,320
will actually add that as well when it's

1957
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,159
safe to do so you can always keep six

1958
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,000
feet apart sure

1959
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,719
oh that's great thank you ever so much

1960
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:20,159
to all of our panelists for your

1961
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,239
contribution i've definitely learnt a

1962
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,880
lot i'm sure our audience have too

1963
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,560
it's a pleasure to

1964
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,239

1967
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,640
organizers and the co-founders for

1968
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,159
inviting us it's been an absolute

1969
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:35,120
pleasure

1970
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,199
and if there's nothing further ado then

1971
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,600
we can put a close to the session

1972
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,120
yes thank you thank you raj lola marcin

martine and maria

1974
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,040
there is one question but we're going to

1975
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,520
move that question to slack because now

1976
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,760
we have to give space to the next

1977
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,360
torque so

1978
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,520
i don't know who send it but let's check

1979
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,000
on the slack channel we'll have guytano

1980
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,080
they will basically move there we can

1981
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,760
have the conversation

1982
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,080
again thank you much everyone it was

1983
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,640
