1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,200
well thanks again everybody it's a real

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,759
pleasure to be here uh again today's

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,760
title is cyber security and the board

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,320
choosing success over the sarlacc pit

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,519
um

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,200
a little background where this title

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,920
came from i actually have a

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,680
podcast series called the cyber security

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,080
effectiveness podcast

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
and i interviewed

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,640
a number of board members from public

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,800
companies private companies

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,760
tech financial services health care so

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,920
on and so forth and one of the board

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,760
members i spoke with said that every

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,120
time a security executive like a ciso

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,879
goes to present to the board it's kind

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,440
of like they fell into the sarlacc pit

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,399
and i'm sure everybody on this call

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,079
knows it but of course the starlock pits

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,719
from star wars uh return of the jedi

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,879
and uh jabba the hutt explains it as

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,239
enduring a indescribable suffering that

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,039
will as you're slowly digested over

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,920
thousands of years so pretty much a

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,640
horrible situation and the point was it

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,720
doesn't have to be this awful situation

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,680
it should actually be very

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,439
bi-directional

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,840
a security executive should get

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,439
content from the board and the board

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,040
should get content from security

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
executives to make the organization more

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,280
successful overall

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,680
but unfortunately sometimes the language

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,040
that people are speaking and the

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,119
direction people are are going in these

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,920
meetings isn't really aligned with uh

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,479
the business strategy and i've pulled

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,720
some quotes out of this uh out of these

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,960
interviews and tried to sprinkle in some

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,880
other data points to make it interesting

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,720
so let's just jump right in

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,280
a little background about myself i'm

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,079
vice president cso for mandy advantage

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,399
i've been in cyber security for about 25

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,960
years i've worked in over 50 countries

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,920
uh fun fact actually they when i first

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,159
left the united states and started doing

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,399
real heavy business travel

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,960
spain was the very first place i went to

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,640
i was with bell labs at the time and i

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,119
was doing a project with telefonica and

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,079
i spent several months in in spain

55
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,840
mostly madrid

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,318
and then went over to uh

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,239
latin america and spent a lot of time in

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,360
brazil argentina chile a lot of time

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,760
through central america etc so spain

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,239
kind of started off this 50 country six

61
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,800
continent journey that i had going on

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
so i started with disa the defense

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,080
information systems agency as part of

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,840
the us government and as i mentioned

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,080
before bell labs mostly based out of sao

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,239
paulo brazil and then i came back to the

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,560
us and i just started building companies

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,720
or helping to build companies uh i've

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
had a couple ipos i've had a bunch of

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,800
acquisitions companies like arcsight

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,920
imperva mcafee solera silence and a

72
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,680
whole bunch of others

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
my latest company was verodin which got

74
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,000
acquired by mandiant just a couple years

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
ago i've written a couple books my last

76
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,599
book was with the former director of the

77
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,480
nsa and i did a cyber war documentary

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,000
with general michael hayden the former

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,959
head of the cia in the nsa so enough

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,920
about me

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
all this to say that i've been in

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,040
security long enough to see how a lot of

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,599
things are done incorrectly

84
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,080
uh agenda a very short historical

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,840
perspective on threads and technologies

86
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
kind of a little bit of a fun background

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,159
but the whole sort of thesis of this

88
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,800
presentation is trying to morph uh

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,680
security executives to have a a broader

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
perspective on things

91
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,200
something that's not so focused on the

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,720
technology the bits and bytes the

93
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,599
attacks the apts etc etc but actually

94
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,720
the business uh as a whole i'm going to

95
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,159
pull out some quotes that i've had with

96
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,920
some of these board members i'll talk

97
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,599
about business relevance as well as

98
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,760
bring up some of the sort of hot topics

99
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,560
that uh they they tend to bring up when

100
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,400
you look at the sort of the aggregation

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,920
of these interviews there's certain

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,120
threads that pop up again and again

103
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,080
so starting off with some of the history

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
one thing i noticed and this is this is

105
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,239
based on a larger presentation that i do

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,000
which is sort of a historical analysis

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,159
of threats is that the threat windows

108
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,319
have really been shrinking over time if

109
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,400
you take things like sea

110
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,200
air space and cyber and you sort of look

111
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,159
at the first time they were

112
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,239
commercialized and evaluate how those

113
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,239
threat windows have morphed it's pretty

114
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,519
interesting so for example 3000 bc in

115
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,600
the mediterranean sea was about the

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
first recordings that we have of people

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
using the c for commerce right the first

118
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,400
consumerization of the sea

119
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,919
we didn't have the first recorded

120
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,120
pirates

121
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,720
until about 1300 bc so there was about

122
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,560
roughly a 1700 year threat window

123
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
between the first time somebody said hey

124
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,800
let's sell something between point a and

125
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,040
point b over the c and somebody just

126
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,320
said well let's just go ahead and rob

127
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,199
that ship so that's a pretty significant

128
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,440
threat window in today's terms

129
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,120
then we take air

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,240
so 1859 john wise tried to commercialize

131
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
the use of air via hot air balloon to

132
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,919
deliver mail and other goods it was a

133
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,560
fantastic idea it crashed and burned it

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,639
literally crashed and burned but it was

135
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,919
a good idea

136
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,400
again the first commercialization of air

137
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,800
we didn't see the first hijacking until

138
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
about 1931 so it didn't take 1700 years

139
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,280
for that threat window to catch up but

140
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,919
it was certainly uh pretty long based on

141
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,759
today's standards

142
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,240
then we go to space so a couple years

143
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,360
after sputnik we had telstar which was a

144
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
t satellite that was being used for

145
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,639
television broadcasting and that was

146
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,080
about 1962 so that was the first

147
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,680
commercialization of space if you will

148
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,560
we haven't really seen a lot in terms of

149
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,440
satellite warfare or attacks that are uh

150
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,919
specific to space the barriers to entry

151
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,160
sort of make it uh not worthwhile to

152
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,080
most attackers but there have been some

153
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,880
isolated incidents uh one was the trilla

154
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,520
data theft in about 2015 and that had to

155
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,039
do with a command and control system

156
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,479
that was actually leveraging satellite

157
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,320
technology

158
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,000
then we have the commercialization of

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,160
the internet so in about 1988 nsfnet had

160
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
a bunch of users and they were

161
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,039
charging them to use email and then mci

162
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,479
at the time had a bunch of users and

163
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,160
they were charging them to use email

164
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,840
they said hey guys why don't we charge

165
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,600
our customers so they can communicate

166
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,240
with each other uh by today's con ideas

167
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,080
what a novel concept let people email

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,199
each other

169
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,319
but

170
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,960
right about this time is when we had the

171
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,000
morris worm and a cavalcade of other

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,080
attacks as well and there was worms and

173
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,319
there were there were uh viruses and

174
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,759
other attacks before this that were

175
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,280
focused on um dex systems and the brain

176
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
which was focused on pcs uh that

177
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,199
predated this but again this was the

178
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,960
first time it was sort of something was

179
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,520
very prolific across the internet as a

180
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,360
whole

181
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
another thing we see is basic technology

182
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,840
can really shift advantage so if any of

183
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,919
you have seen the movie 300

184
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,919
you've seen these you know greek greek

185
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,880
warriors uh in about 323 bc

186
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
and they had iron and they had bronze

187
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,880
that those were their metals that was

188
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
the advancement of their technology and

189
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,160
they would fight with a phalanx unit

190
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,840
where they would move as one unit and

191
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,520
they were highly highly effective for a

192
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,880
very long time

193
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,479
by today's standards not very

194
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,199
technologically advanced bronze and iron

195
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,440
in fact relatively

196
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,759
simple technologies but highly effective

197
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,120
at the time and because of that they

198
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,680
were able to rule the ancient world

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,599
until the romans came around and the

200
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
romans had this sword called the gladius

201
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,960
sword which uh incidentally was a design

202
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,520
a spanish design so anyways but they had

203
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,759
this sword that was made out of steel so

204
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,120
at the time wow there's this new

205
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,520
technology called steel that's uh much

206
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,360
harder and stronger and can keep a

207
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,720
better edge than bronze and iron and uh

208
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,319
the flexibility that this allowed them

209
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,599
is they didn't have to just stand in

210
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,039
front of the greeks and fight this

211
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,639
phalanx head on

212
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,160
they could flank them they could fight

213
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,319
them on hills in the trees and the rocks

214
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,879
in the mud in areas where the phalanx

215
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,680
were not that successful so not only did

216
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,000
the technology help shift advantage but

217
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,720
as a result of the

218
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
technology they could change their

219
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,319
processes as well so again basic

220
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,000
technology but you can kind of see how

221
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,560
that really shifts advantage

222
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
moving into the future a little bit into

223
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
the 1400s we've got the ottoman empire

224
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
modern-day turkey and these folks were

225
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,879
called the janna series and what was

226
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,080
interesting about them is they weren't

227
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,800
the first military to use gunpowder uh

228
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
or have muskets but they were the first

229
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,039
one to really embrace it in mass and say

230
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,360
this is a game changer and what this had

231
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,919
to do with was complexity complexity

232
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,599
because teaching somebody how to use a

233
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,320
longbow for example and actually be good

234
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
at it could take years

235
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,200
just to just to be lucky to hit your

236
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,000
target with a musket you can be trained

237
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,320
and pretty good with it in a few weeks

238
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
you might not be an expert marksman but

239
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,680
you know how to load it you know how to

240
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,160
clean it you know how to fire it um they

241
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,519
weren't really that accurate to begin

242
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,440
with honestly but if you've got hundreds

243
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,120
of people with muskets all pointing the

244
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,640
same direction

245
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,920
statistically they're going to hit

246
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
something especially when the people

247
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,240
charging them have leather armor maybe

248
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
chain mail they're armed with pointy

249
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,480
sticks and swords and you've got a big

250
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,880
army with gunpowder so that dramatically

251
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
shifted advantage and one of the reasons

252
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,640
was it reduced the complexity of

253
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
training people

254
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,880
a relatively modern uh or somewhat

255
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,920
modern example is world war ii so before

256
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,080
that i'll actually say in world war one

257
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,959
um

258
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,920
the united states and and our allies and

259
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,600
in uh and england and france uh

260
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,880
had uh a lot of armored uh vehicles

261
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,399
plant plenty of tanks and things of that

262
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
nature the germans at the time didn't

263
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,440
think that armored warfare was really uh

264
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,720
that valuable it wasn't really something

265
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,640
to be embraced but after world war one

266
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,399
they figured it out and they said wow

267
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,880
mobile armored warfare is the way to go

268
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
so in world war one germany had about

269
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,160
twenty

270
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,200
tanks

271
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
not twenty thousand twenty they had

272
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,399
twenty tanks by world war two germany

273
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,200
had a hundred and sixty thousand tanks

274
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
and other armored vehicles as well

275
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,519
now what's interesting about this tank

276
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,279
is this was the tiger tank and the tiger

277
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,640
and panther tanks

278
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,160
again a movie reference if you ever saw

279
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,959
the movie fury with brad pitt

280
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,920
these were highly advanced on paper they

281
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,600
were the most sophisticated thing out

282
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,680
there for sure they were powerful they

283
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,519
were complex and they were built like a

284
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,040
fine-tuned clock

285
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,240
the problem

286
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,160
it took a lot of time to train people

287
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,320
how to operate these tanks and if

288
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,920
something happened to these tanks

289
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,120
because they were

290
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,600
their manufacturing tolerances were so

291
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,519
tight because they were really sort of a

292
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,760
masterpiece in design

293
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,680
that was an achilles heel

294
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,440
because if you had to fix something you

295
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
needed a supply chain to provide

296
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
mechanics that could fix it the parts

297
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,920
that need to be replaced the tools that

298
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,760
they could leverage in the field and

299
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,959
generally if you're in the middle of the

300
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,120
battlefield you don't really have the

301
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,560
all the supplies you need it's not the

302
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,200
safest place so even though the us like

303
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,040
the m4 shermans and the tanks that were

304
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,120
being developed by the russians paled in

305
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,440
comparison in terms of capabilities they

306
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
were far more successful because if you

307
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
could drive a car you could drive one of

308
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,120
these tanks and you could be highly

309
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
successful if one blew up that's okay

310
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,880
you'll just pump another one out because

311
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
it's so easy to train people they're so

312
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,200
easy to produce so because of that of

313
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,880
course uh that was one of the reasons

314
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,920
the allies were far more successful

315
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,760
so let's just jump into that that all

316
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,040
kind of gives you some background just

317
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,680
changing perspective on complexity and

318
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,360
technology shifts and things of that

319
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
nature toward the seeds of this part

320
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,040
here so this first quote is from art

321
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
coviello he's been a mentor of mine for

322
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,040
years and art was the former executive

323
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,920
chairman for uh rsa um brilliant

324
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,680
brilliant guy has been in security

325
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,200
forever it's been running businesses

326
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,640
he's on the board of public financial

327
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
services companies and a ton of tech

328
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
companies but he says all companies

329
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,720
bigger small public or private must

330
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,959
embrace cyber security as a key issue

331
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,720
with today's threat landscape if you

332
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
don't you're not meeting your fiduciary

333
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,120
responsibilities i like the simplicity

334
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,519
of this quote to kick things off because

335
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,120
if you think about it they're just

336
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,720
saying look it's it's not a question of

337
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,240
whether you should talk about cyber or

338
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,320
not at the board level you have to and

339
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,399
if you don't you're not addressing your

340
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,160
fiduciary responsibilities which is the

341
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,600
number one thing that board members have

342
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,040
to concern themselves about so cyber

343
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,200
isn't a nice to have it's a must-have at

344
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,639
these conversation points so board

345
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,560
members want to talk about this but more

346
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,120
importantly they have to talk about this

347
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,639
so you're already in a situation where

348
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,399
they want to have these discussions and

349
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,000
furthermore and i don't have art's quote

350
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
for this but one of the other things he

351
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,800
told me was

352
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,120
the most powerful committee now on a

353
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,680
publicly traded company's board and

354
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,440
boards are made up of various committees

355
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
audit committees and finance committees

356
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,279
and acquisition committees but the most

357
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,519
powerful committee on a publicly traded

358
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,079
board today is the audit committee and

359
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,399
they've stopped asking cyber security

360
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,320
leaders do you have security controls in

361
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,839
place to mitigate risk because the

362
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,680
answer is always the same of course we

363
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,839
do but we still need more money we need

364
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,519
more money for more tools for more

365
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,920
training to hire more people

366
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,240
what auditors are now asking is can you

367
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,519
prove to me

368
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,839
can you prove to me that the security

369
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,120
controls that we have in place are

370
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,480
actually effective

371
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,720
across endpoint email network and cloud

372
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,920
are they doing what they're supposed to

373
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,000
do and the people in the processes are

374
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,920
they effective and furthermore can you

375
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,760
prove that that money that you're asking

376
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,639
the cfo or the ceo for

377
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,320
in terms of further investment is

378
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,240
absolutely necessary and we can't get

379
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,680
that money out of other solutions we've

380
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,440
already purchased so it really comes

381
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,800
down to evidence and proof these days

382
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,399
another thing that we found is it's not

383
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,240
really about cyber risk when you're

384
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,160
having these conversations at the board

385
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,800
it's about the financial the brand and

386
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,639
the operational risk that comes from

387
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,600
cyber

388
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,519
board members and other executives they

389
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,360
think of risk thousands of different

390
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,079
types of risk it's a risk to open up a

391
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,920
business in a new country it's a risk to

392
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,839
embrace a new product it's a risk to

393
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,279
inquire that acquire this other

394
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,440
organization so there's lots of risk

395
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,880
cyber is one

396
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,079
right and when they look at it they

397
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,519
don't look at it because oh this is

398
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,240
ransomware botnet or a new trojan or new

399
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,320
apt they look at it from an impact

400
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,519
analysis to finance brand and operations

401
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,279
and now you're seeing a lot of ceos in

402
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,920
the news even from sort of lagging

403
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,880
adopters in cyber technology people like

404
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
power and energy companies

405
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,639
where they're going on tv they're going

406
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,160
they're doing interviews talking about

407
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,320
the importance of cyber security not

408
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,079
because they woke up one day and felt it

409
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,680
was the right thing to do at least in

410
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,760
most cases that's probably not it

411
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,839
they're doing it because they have to

412
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,120
their shareholders and their

413
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
stakeholders are demanding it they're

414
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,279
demanding that they address these issues

415
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,199
because they have to because back to

416
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,000
arts quote fiduciary responsibility

417
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,240
that's why cyber risks are being found

418
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
and they're discussing it in annual

419
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,880
reports corporate governance documents

420
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,680
uh committee charters all these official

421
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,399
publicly available business documents

422
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
are now mentioning cyber as one of the

423
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,120
risks that they have to look at

424
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
and at this level you have to be able to

425
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,440
measure your security effectiveness like

426
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,760
other strategic business units so if you

427
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,279
go to a cfo for example and the ceo asks

428
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,279
hey cfo how much money do we have in the

429
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,160
bank

430
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,720
and her response is well

431
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,959
i can't give the exact number but we do

432
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,360
pci audits and miter attacked this and

433
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,959
this that and we just did a red team

434
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,120
exercise and patch management and

435
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
vulnerability it just wouldn't fly they

436
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,160
just want to know how much money is in

437
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
the bank right and we've gotten kind of

438
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,920
a pass on that in security we have a

439
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,279
very kind of squishy risk based response

440
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,160
well that doesn't fly at this level so

441
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,320
boards demand evidence

442
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,480
measures that are tangible there's no

443
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,320
room for guesswork there's no room for

444
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,480
assumptions they want facts just like

445
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,240
they get from sales and finance and

446
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,480
operations now we've been asking to have

447
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,199
security have a seat at the board level

448
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,639
for decades

449
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,320
well now it's happened

450
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,880
but now we have to adop adapt as

451
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,199
security leaders to make sure that the

452
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,720
information that we're sharing with

453
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
these board members are in a format that

454
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
they can actually leverage that it is

455
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,399
strategic it is based on facts and is

456
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,720
based on measures

457
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,399
there's about six things

458
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,480
that kind of across the board all these

459
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,199
board members uh kind of agreed on uh

460
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,360
this is sort of the major six this is

461
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,720
what they really care about at the end

462
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,240
of the day and again none of it's based

463
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,560
on specific attacks it's are my

464
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,320
communication services secure things

465
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,440
like email

466
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,759
are my financial services systems all

467
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,040
the systems that are attracting the

468
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
actual money of course those are those

469
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,279
are key customer data and intellectual

470
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,680
property is that safe are the critical

471
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,199
applications and the infrastructure

472
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,279
supporting those critical applications

473
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,279
are those secure are making sure that

474
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,720
only the people that are supposed to get

475
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,279
access actually have access and can we

476
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,519
demonstrate compliance

477
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,600
that's it those are the big six nowhere

478
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,000
do we see ransomware apt and things like

479
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,160
that not that those things are important

480
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,920
those are feeders into these specific

481
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,000
points but you have to speak it at this

482
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,160
level or else you get invited to talk to

483
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,320
the board they give you an hour and then

484
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,600
next quarter they invite you back they

485
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,279
only give you five minutes because they

486
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,959
just don't have the cycles to process

487
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,520
everything that's being pushed out

488
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,039
this is alexa king she has an

489
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,400
interesting background because she's a

490
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,319
lawyer in addition to being a cyber

491
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,400
security executive and a

492
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,880
a member of a number of boards and alexa

493
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,640
says if you provide boards with

494
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,559
evidence-based data that word again

495
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,559
evidence regarding your cyber security

496
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,079
posture trends intelligence

497
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,400
effectiveness etc they should be able to

498
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,839
provide you

499
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,600
with valuable input based on their

500
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,360
broader perspectives so it's

501
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,679
bi-directional this isn't just the cso

502
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,679
or other security executives doing a

503
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,919
dance in front of the board this is also

504
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,480
supposed to be the board giving input to

505
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
security executives because

506
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,679
theoretically and hopefully the board

507
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,200
has a broader perspective they're having

508
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,799
conversations that the security team

509
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,559
isn't privy to they're working with

510
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,559
other organizations supply chains

511
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,280
partners they have this broader maybe

512
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,960
not security specific but broader

513
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,640
perspective that could be impactful to

514
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
you just as what you say could be

515
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,240
impactful to them so it's a give and

516
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,559
take it's education on both sides and

517
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,000
you should be getting as much as you're

518
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,240
as you're putting in

519
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,799
now business relevance so across all

520
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,440
industries businesses rely on their

521
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,760
critical assets and this is to generate

522
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
revenue be competitive

523
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,440
drive value all these things that we

524
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,880
think of when we think of business

525
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,240
relevance but as a board member as a

526
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,880
non-technical non-security executive

527
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,760
even

528
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,120
everything kind of falls into these

529
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,360
categories of business relevance um the

530
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,880
other one is business continuity how do

531
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
i keep the the business running access

532
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,640
to data and customer systems and

533
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,559
critical infrastructure what about

534
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,600
regulatory mandates and compliance and

535
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,919
privacy concerns and legal issues and

536
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,520
then critical asset protection which we

537
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,720
talked about before everything from

538
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,120
intellectual property to customer data

539
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,720
and finally and i think my the most

540
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,799
important point here is rationalization

541
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,240
and optimization

542
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,480
it wasn't until maybe five or six years

543
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,600
ago

544
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,840
yeah maybe five years ago the first time

545
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,480
we ever saw somebody with the title a vp

546
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,960
of security rationalization or seeing a

547
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,039
security rationalization team

548
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,960
and the whole point of these new teams i

549
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,559
i started seeing it first in financial

550
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,600
services now i see it in a lot of groups

551
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,120
they're rationalizing security

552
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,480
investments to make sure that they're

553
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,919
actually getting value from the tools

554
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,679
they've bought if i spend a million

555
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,520
dollars in firewalls am i getting a

556
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,360
million dollars in value or am i only

557
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,600
getting like 200 or 300 000 worth of

558
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,880
value

559
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,120
do we have a lot of overlap do my people

560
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,520
know how to use these new tools are the

561
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,440
processes still effective

562
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,120
how much budget do we really need and

563
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,880
how do we prioritize where to invest

564
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,160
next

565
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,480
rationalization and optimization

566
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
ensuring that you're getting the most

567
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,679
value possible out of your tools this is

568
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,919
becoming highly highly important because

569
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,160
again like sales and finance and

570
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,080
operations they always have to

571
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,720
rationalize and security now has to do

572
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,640
the same thing so because of that you're

573
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,760
seeing groups out there that are

574
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
specifically focused on rationalizing

575
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,320
and optimization

576
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,240
um here's jayleek jay was the former

577
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,559
ciso for blackstone huge financial

578
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,559
services company publicly traded and

579
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,280
then he became a cyber security uh

580
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,840
investor and was the co-founder of a

581
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,640
vc called clear sky and jay sits on a

582
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,799
ton of technology in cyber security

583
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,640
boards just brilliant brilliant guy and

584
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,039
jay says boards and business executives

585
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,039
can generally quantify risk brought on

586
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,200
by economic downturns political

587
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,760
challenges natural disasters but

588
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,919
understanding preparedness and impact

589
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,559
analysis for cyber is often based on

590
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,640
assumptions because a lot of

591
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,480
evidence-based measures

592
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,320
and that comes up again and again with

593
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,640
these guys evidence-based measures not

594
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,720
assumption-based security again there's

595
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,280
zero tolerance for guesswork

596
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,679
for hopes and prayers for assumptions at

597
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,240
the board level they want facts what's

598
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,720
working what's not what's optimized

599
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
what's providing value where are the

600
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,080
gaps these are the types of things that

601
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,720
we need to see

602
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,880
so some of the things that we see uh

603
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,960
just in general in organizations that

604
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,799
really reduce value because again these

605
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,240
conversations come down to how much

606
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,919
value are we getting are we getting from

607
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:08,799
our group

608
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,559
things like um

609
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,240
week out of the box configurations when

610
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,919
somebody does a poc

611
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,760
usually default out of the box

612
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
configurations are designed not to be so

613
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
loud that it scares off the security

614
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,799
team and they think it's going to be too

615
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,320
much work so they don't want to buy it

616
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,080
and not too quiet

617
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,120
because they don't want to think that

618
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,480
they're not getting any value from this

619
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,400
thing so they kind of aim for the middle

620
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,559
which is probably fine for a poc but

621
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,720
it's never the right design for a

622
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,799
production environment however we see a

623
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,720
lot of weak out of the box default

624
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
configurations because of that even some

625
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,320
of the basic attacks aren't being

626
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,159
prevented because it could be seen as

627
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,559
being too noisy for example

628
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,280
lack of resources post deployment maybe

629
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,120
there was a lot of time and focus spent

630
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
on deploying this new technology and you

631
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,799
had different consultants and vendors

632
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,200
and everybody in there but a week goes

633
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,679
by a month goes by a quarter a year

634
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,919
and there's no post deployment support

635
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,440
for those so they just kind of sit there

636
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,320
and rock you don't get the value out

637
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,679
miss configuration or under

638
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,360
configuration uh on average we usually

639
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,120
find that people are getting about 20 of

640
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,280
the value out of the security controls

641
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,520
whether that's endpoint email network or

642
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
cloud it's not because of bad tech it's

643
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,919
not because of bad people generally it's

644
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,360
a function of there's just so many

645
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,520
different security vendors on site most

646
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,360
companies on average have about 70

647
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,880
different security vendors that they

648
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,799
leverage i've seen banks that have over

649
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,600
200 which is nuts to try to even keep

650
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,360
those devices running let alone get

651
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,799
value from them

652
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,480
things like sim issues

653
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,240
i like to use sim as an example because

654
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,159
sim is a superset and i spent about

655
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,919
seven years at arc site so i kind of saw

656
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,320
the sim space evolve from zero customer

657
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
zero revenue all the way through uh us

658
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,679
taking it public

659
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,880
in sim

660
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,799
you have to make sure that ntp is right

661
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,440
and and parsing is correct and all the

662
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,400
ips's and uh and firewalls and

663
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,480
everything reporting up into the sim are

664
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,000
actually getting the information there

665
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,480
properly and that it didn't throw up a

666
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,640
syslog a proxy server that's blocking

667
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,559
syslog now the sudden your sims not

668
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,960
working accurately so sim is the

669
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,200
superset of all these other devices

670
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,039
then you get to the point of doing

671
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,880
pattern discovery anomaly detection

672
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,039
volumetric analysis temporal analysis

673
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,200
correlation rules and alerting

674
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,960
hoping that everything below it was

675
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,640
right so it's a very expensive

676
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,320
investment it's very hard to get right

677
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,600
because

678
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,679
you you are dependent on all these other

679
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,120
things working properly so if you

680
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,720
haven't optimized and ensured that all

681
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
those security tools reporting to the

682
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,640
sem are actually working effectively

683
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,320
they're being parsed properly

684
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,240
everything's accurate chances are you're

685
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,840
not going to get value out of a product

686
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,000
like sim and i've spent

687
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,919
thousands of hours writing rules and

688
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,840
pattern discovery anomalies and all the

689
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,320
detection all the stuff in sim

690
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,760
the other big problem is you have no way

691
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,520
to test it once you've written all this

692
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,120
so how do i validate that all my

693
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,039
security controls my sim are reporting

694
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,640
properly

695
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,919
if i don't have any way to test and

696
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,679
validate because they're so complex

697
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,720
you're just writing these things and

698
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
hoping that when a real attack happens

699
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,640
they actually work and again assumptions

700
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,320
don't work in security

701
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,880
um here's matt biggie uh matt's been an

702
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,760
investor and a board advisor for several

703
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,039
decades and

704
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,039
primarily security companies but a large

705
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,880
number of tech companies he said that

706
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
our communities evaluate a wide range of

707
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,000
risks

708
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,080
from standard accounting practices to

709
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,520
the composition of boards we talked

710
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
about all those committees earlier in

711
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,880
cyber security historically audit

712
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,080
committees have lack controls

713
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,080
effectiveness evidence validation

714
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,600
measures against threat intel and

715
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,320
optimization metrics so that that thing

716
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,400
that we saw before validation evidence

717
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,720
but also now fret intel and thread intel

718
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,039
has come up as this big topic now not as

719
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,880
a lagging indicator of compromise for

720
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,200
iocs

721
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,760
in other variables about uh you know the

722
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,919
latest threat actors etc

723
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,720
but

724
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,039
now it's becoming this sort of tip of

725
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,640
the spear if you will so i want to

726
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,960
evaluate all my security controls

727
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,360
against the latest threat intel and then

728
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,039
measure their effectiveness and then i

729
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,960
can report that back to the board when

730
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
the board says well where do we stand

731
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,039
how secure our systems well we've

732
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,360
evaluated all of our security controls

733
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
against the latest threat intelligence

734
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,960
this is what's working this is what's

735
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,799
not this is what we can kind of put some

736
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,720
compensating controls on this is where

737
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,320
we need additional evidence it's very

738
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,919
black and white it's just right there in

739
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,679
front of you so again the validation and

740
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,919
threat intelligence go hand in hand

741
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,200
and when you're talking about this

742
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,720
validation

743
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,159
it's really a completely different

744
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,159
approach to security security has a lot

745
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,360
of things that are better but not

746
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,120
different so this firewall is better

747
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,039
than that firewall this ips is better

748
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,440
than that this cloud security uh

749
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,360
solution is better than this one

750
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,120
but what about something different so

751
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,520
validation breach and attack stimulation

752
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,279
all of these types of solutions are

753
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,720
really designed to think about this

754
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,279
different so identifying the the the gap

755
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,360
then tuning to make sure that you

756
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,679
address that gap then testing to make

757
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,919
sure that those adjustments you made

758
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,919
actually mitigate that risk

759
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,440
then automating those tests in

760
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,039
perpetuity to make sure that that thing

761
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,039
that was working last week is working

762
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,360
this week and will work next week being

763
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,880
able to rationalize being able to very

764
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,640
simply say this is what's working this

765
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,400
is what's not i'm going to map it to

766
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,360
miter attack or nist or oasper sans i'm

767
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,080
able to report on what i'm finding and

768
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,480
demonstrate the value of my team to the

769
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,559
board at the same time by showing we are

770
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,679
strategic

771
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,679
we are measuring effectiveness like

772
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,960
other strategic business units do

773
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,440
uh this one's uh bill kroll so bill and

774
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,880
i actually wrote a book together several

775
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,799
years ago brilliant guy

776
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,960
he he was the deputy director of the nsa

777
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,440
for several decades

778
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,640
and uh

779
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,159
so he probably knows more about threat

780
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,600
intelligence than most people on the

781
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,720
planet uh in addition to that

782
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
uh bill sits on a number of boards today

783
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,679
as well

784
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,799
so he says having an intelligence

785
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,400
intelligence-led approach

786
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,760
intelligence-led is something we'll hit

787
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,279
on more in a moment but having an

788
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,720
intelligence-led approach to cyber

789
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,799
security doesn't just make the security

790
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,799
team more effective it provides the

791
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,880
evidence leadership needs to ensure that

792
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,039
your goals objectives and priorities are

793
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,799
aligned with their business requirements

794
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,240
in the face of the latest relevant

795
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,520
threats and threat actors

796
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,559
iocs and ttps great we need that

797
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,000
information but if you don't have

798
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,679
intelligence that can be personalized

799
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,360
and operationalized you can't have a

800
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,440
threat intelligence-led approach if you

801
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,799
do have a threat intelligence-led

802
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,559
approach meaning that you're taking this

803
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,559
threat intelligence in real time in an

804
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,279
automated way and validating that is my

805
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,520
end point able to block and detect mimi

806
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,159
cats uh can i stop uh command and

807
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,840
control and beaconing what if someone's

808
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,159
trying to tunnel over icmp and having

809
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,600
these capabilities where you're actually

810
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,919
testing in real time as these iocs and

811
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,240
ttps are coming through then you're not

812
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,760
really leveraging threat intelligence to

813
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,600
its best capability and you can't have

814
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,520
an intelligence-led approach if you

815
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,120
can't have that then you're not actually

816
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,480
helping the business as much as you

817
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,840
could

818
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,600
um so having this intelligence-led

819
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,159
approach again this is a theme that kept

820
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,080
on coming up it's become the new tip of

821
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,919
the spear again it used to be kind of

822
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,000
like a nice to have threat intelligence

823
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,840
um then it became yeah it really is

824
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,520
important but i use it forensically as a

825
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,760
lagging indicator a compromise and now

826
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,799
it's becoming highly highly important um

827
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,120
how relevant are my security controls

828
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,480
right in the face of these latest

829
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,640
attacks can i personalize these attacks

830
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,799
if i'm a financial services company i

831
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,080
don't really care that much about the

832
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,080
threat intelligence that's specific to

833
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,440
plc's and uh scada systems right health

834
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,799
care organizations have different

835
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,039
requirements etc what are my safety

836
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,000
levels

837
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,679
what's my outcome awareness if we were

838
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,799
to get hit

839
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,320
what's the impact does this mean they'll

840
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,159
be able to get customer data or get into

841
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,279
the critical infrastructure that

842
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,039
supports the systems that have the

843
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,679
customer data and can i report on this

844
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,360
and based on these reports can i talk

845
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,120
about what my security spending needs to

846
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,200
be in my budgets and then i want to be

847
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,279
able to leverage this process of taking

848
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,200
new threat intel because by the time i

849
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,880
test something for threat intelligence

850
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,559
something new is right behind it that's

851
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,600
the thing about threat until it's

852
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
constantly constantly changing so having

853
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,960
an automated approach where you can

854
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,880
leverage threat intelligence is becoming

855
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,320
really key according to these board

856
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,440
members

857
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,919
karen nortman uh sits again on a number

858
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,440
of boards

859
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,720
a lot of investment in the cloud

860
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,880
security area as well she says companies

861
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,039
are embracing cyber security services at

862
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,200
an increasing rate so i think we've all

863
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,760
all know that mssps and red teams and

864
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,200
incident responders and all these other

865
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,640
services can be leveraged they've been

866
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,880
around forever but now we're seeing this

867
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
embrace an increasing rate and she goes

868
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,640
on to say this trend will continue to

869
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,720
intensify augmenting your cyber security

870
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,559
controls your teams and your sas

871
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,960
solutions with specialized expertise

872
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,640
means greater security eye and reduced

873
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,520
risk

874
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,000
well it also means scale yes it's gonna

875
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,600
hopefully you can leverage these experts

876
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,880
because you're not gonna be able to hire

877
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,200
enough or train enough or retain enough

878
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
to do everything yourself these days and

879
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,039
threat intelligence is a great example

880
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,640
most organizations don't have the

881
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,320
staffing capabilities to have a really

882
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,399
effective threat intelligence team maybe

883
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,840
they've got some security folks that are

884
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,760
dual hattered with threat intel but it's

885
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,279
hard to really scale that way as the

886
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,440
organization grows so leveraging an

887
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,720
organization that has some kind of

888
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,640
threat intelligence or multiple i'm a

889
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,320
big fan of having multiple sources of

890
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,159
threat intel and then being able to

891
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,000
automate that process again so you can

892
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
tip at the sphere of it make

893
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
an intelligence-led approach to security

894
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,080
really helps you scale it's not just

895
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,279
thread intel

896
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,360
it can be validation as a managed

897
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,279
service it could be you know incident

898
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,880
responders that you can um you know

899
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,640
you can call if something happens so you

900
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,720
have them on retainer for example so

901
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,960
augmenting with services is becoming the

902
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,039
new paradigm it's been around forever

903
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,200
but i think because of scale and

904
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,880
opportunity cost people are saying we

905
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,320
really have to leverage services a lot

906
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,279
more

907
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,760
so my final thoughts on this as we as we

908
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,279
wrap up here are

909
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,000
security of course is strategic

910
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,360
if you want to have these conversations

911
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,000
with the c suite in boards you better

912
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,360
make sure that you're not talking with

913
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,200
assumptions you have to talk with

914
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,120
evidence-based metrics or unless you're

915
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,399
going to be laughed out of the room

916
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,399
you're not going to be invited back

917
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,720
and you have to be sure to let them know

918
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,919
when you're speaking to the board

919
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,399
security is just not about the tools

920
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,679
it's about the intelligence the

921
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,840
expertise behind them so not only your

922
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
people and your processes within your

923
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,760
organization but the ones that you can

924
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,000
augment that through as well validation

925
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
is one approach to this breach and

926
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
attack simulation is another approach to

927
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
this but anything that you can do to

928
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,519
help you measure the effectiveness of

929
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,519
your security controls

930
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,159
in an automated way in perpetuity to

931
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,120
make sure they're doing what they're

932
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,200
doing adds tremendous value and gives

933
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,640
you those metrics and those that

934
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,880
evidence that you need and if it can be

935
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
intelligence led me you're just not

936
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,799
looking at these old stodgy sql attacks

937
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,799
from 20 years ago which you still should

938
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,399
test against because they still work in

939
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,640
a lot a lot of cases unfortunately but

940
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,480
you're also testing the latest iocs and

941
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,360
ttps to make sure that that latest intel

942
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,440
is being validated against your controls

943
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,360
and finally you have measurable value

944
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
and roi you're showing the value of

945
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,600
security what it brings to the business

946
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,399
again just like sales and operations and

947
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,120
finance now i cherry picked a few uh a

948
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,960
few of these interviews just to share

949
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,320
because i don't have the cycles to talk

950
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,919
about them all of course but i've done

951
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,240
over 100 interviews um again it's the

952
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,840
cyber security effect in this podcast

953
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,320
you can find it on spotify or itunes

954
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,240
whatever you use to listen to your your

955
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,760
podcasts

956
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,279
and we try to keep them very vendor

957
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,519
independent with lots of experts red

958
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,679
teamers blue teamers reverse engineers

959
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,240
ceos founders lawyers

960
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,720
venture capitalists board members ceos

961
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,559
you name it it's a pretty broad broad

962
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,320
spectrum um

963
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,080
so with that i'd like to thank everybody

964
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,000
for uh their time today and i really

965
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,840
appreciate being part of uh

966
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,360
besides barcelona thank you so much
