1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,120
then out of my home but you know i would

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,319
like to hear

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,240
what you know is bringing to you to the

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,040
table so stage is just jenna uh good

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,880
luck with the presentation

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,719
right thank you alejandro

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,039
um welcome everybody today indeed i'm

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,640
going to present my talk on smart home

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,720
devices and we'll take a look at whether

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,400
they're assets in your household or

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,560
liabilities in your household or a bit

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,840
of both

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,680
first i would like to quickly introduce

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,640
myself

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,279
i am a consultant on the cyber strategy

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,920
team of the consultancy company and viso

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,239
located in brussels belgium

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,360
where i

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,520
use my technical background to solve

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,840
more high level and strategic problems

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,079
for clients i have a master's degree in

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,559
computer science but i'm complementing

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,879
that one with another master's program

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,640
in ict law

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,199
so i can get a bit of both of those

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,120
topics

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,480
you have my contact details there as

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,680
well

29
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,120
the research i will be presenting for

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,520
you today was actually conducted as my

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,680
master thesis in computer science at the

32
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,760
university of durban

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,600
in collaboration with the labs division

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,000
at the visa called invisalups so it was

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,840
done in 2020

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,760
under the paper the state of the market

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,759
a comparative study of iot device

38
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,600
security implementations

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
that paper should be publicly available

40
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,640
on the libraries of kai11 so if you are

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,479
interested after this talk to read the

42
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,680
entire thing

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,200
you can take a look on the reference

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,640
there and read it

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,600
for today i will go over the context of

46
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,759
the research that we performed i will

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,680
quickly explain our methodology our

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,360
results and then we'll end with a

49
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,159
conclusion and some future prospects

50
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,560
that we can expect on the smart home

51
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
devices markets

52
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,520
we already mentioned that this talk is

53
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,439
about smart home devices but what's the

54
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,000
big deal with smart home devices anyway

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,479
well i think at this point in time the

56
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,119
smart home environments markets has

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,240
boomed uh greatly we see more and more

58
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,399
households where at least one or two

59
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,200
devices have become smart even those

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
people who didn't really go out of their

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,959
way to buy a smart device i have a smart

62
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,160
tv these days um and it's almost

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,000
impossible to to ban these items from

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,319
your household entirely

65
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,640
if you look at the market forecasts of

66
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,720
zion market research we see that over

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,040
the coming years that market is still

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,520
expected to grow even further

69
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,160
and that's where we got a bit concerned

70
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,480
just like alejandra already mentioned

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,599
every week or if not every day we see

72
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,440
news articles popping up

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
on the internet on all kinds of

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,840
newspapers where there are security or

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,560
privacy concerns or both about these

76
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,400
smart home devices

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
with people who are afraid of being

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,959
spied on or a hacker taking them over

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,560
one of the trends that we've seen a

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,480
while ago was

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
not even very technical people going

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,280
around

83
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,200
more fancy neighborhoods

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,920
go to a house where the window is open

85
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,800
and yell alexa open the front door and

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,440
in some cases that would work

87
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,120
so you would think that this market is

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,959
quite heavily regulated but that is

89
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,000
actually not

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
the case at the moment there is of

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
course the normal

92
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
cybersecurity regulations and the

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,440
regulations on cyber crime that are

94
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,599
there but there is no specific law at

95
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,920
this point that will say a smart home

96
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,720
device of a certain kind needs to adhere

97
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,959
to certain requirements

98
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,840
for privacy that is a different story

99
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,599
because of course we have quite some

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,680
privacy regulations in place

101
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
we have the fundamental charters which

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,200
is the european convention of human

103
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,879
rights that outlines the right to

104
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,000
privacy

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,680
there's also the charter of fundamental

106
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
rights of the european union that again

107
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,239
confirms that right to privacy

108
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,920
and then in the european union

109
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,000
specifically we also have

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,560
the gdpr the very well-known general

111
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,879
data protection regulation as well as

112
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,480
the e-privacy directive which is

113
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,239
currently being reviewed for a newer

114
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,640
version to be more in line with that

115
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,400
gdpr

116
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
so we have some regulation on privacy

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,080
but not on security and that's what we

118
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,959
were wondering do we need regulation on

119
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,480
the security of these smart home devices

120
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,440
so we decided to do some tests

121
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,120
and to give you an idea what we tested

122
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,079
well we bought a range of devices

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,800
these devices they were chosen based on

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,479
a few selection criteria to be as

125
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,880
objective as possible so we take

126
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
different devices with different kinds

127
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,280
of popularity the availability was very

128
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,040
important on the european market of

129
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
course

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,919
we took devices from different price

131
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,400
ranges and with differing

132
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,960
levels of brand recognition

133
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,680
so

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
as you can see on the schematic on the

135
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,160
right we had of all types of devices

136
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,720
that smart device hubs light bulbs baby

137
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,199
monitors door locks and so on quite a

138
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,160
few different devices and if it was

139
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,840
possible we would always try to get two

140
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,919
of the same kind from a different price

141
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,360
range from a different brands so that we

142
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
could compare the two it's not that was

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,039
no not always possible but it was

144
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,880
something that we had as a goal

145
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,479
and then when we had our devices we

146
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,000
needed to test them

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,479
so how did we define our tests

148
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,199
well there is no binding regulation that

149
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,199
says how the security of these devices

150
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,880
should be done

151
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
but there are some guidelines available

152
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,680
the european institute for network and

153
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,160
information security or nisa they

154
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,120
publish

155
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,280
guidelines a guideline document for

156
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,919
smart home iot devices in which they

157
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,199
have some

158
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,280
policy recommendations

159
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,800
we took that document

160
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
you see a small fragment of that

161
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,120
document on the slide with some uh with

162
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,639
some markings on it

163
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,320
we took those policy recommendations and

164
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,039
we would define a test case to comply

165
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,000
with those

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,080
policy recommendations so one example

167
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,120
test case from our set of tests was to

168
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,319
verify that the encryption

169
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,479
configurations that were used for the

170
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,880
communications that they are adequate

171
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,160
in that case we are talking about tls

172
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
we wanted to make sure that our tests

173
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,280
covered a very wide area of aspects of

174
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,680
security so we made a deliberate choice

175
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,639
not to go very in-depth do not dig deep

176
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,800
into each device because we had in total

177
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,440
15 devices to test and a limited time to

178
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,720
do so

179
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,560
so instead we went for tests that were

180
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,880
very repeatable that we could uh use

181
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,639
automated tooling for and standardize

182
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,199
procedures so that anyone else

183
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,800
doing the same research with the same

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,840
methodology would have the same

185
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,120
conclusion then we also allocated a

186
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
fixed time for each test so that the

187
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,360
testing could never take longer than an

188
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,840
allocated time for each device

189
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,199
and as i already mentioned we wanted to

190
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
cover a very wide attack surface instead

191
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,080
of a very specific narrow one that we

192
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,039
went deeper into

193
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,120
and that brings us to the methodology

194
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,199
for security we had a test setup that

195
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,440
looked a bit like this

196
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,520
this is what we would call a typical

197
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,080
household with smart devices in it so on

198
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,240
the slide here we have

199
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,720
the internet represented as a cloud and

200
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,199
your home router is connected to the

201
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,199
internet for you where you have your

202
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,960
smart device in this case we chose a

203
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
camera and you have maybe your home

204
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,720
laptop that's also connected to that

205
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
same router

206
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,560
on the other hand you also have a phone

207
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,960
tower cell phone tower that you connect

208
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,880
to with your cell phone and again your

209
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,400
cell phone is connected to the internet

210
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,160
where you can also access your device

211
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,680
that way

212
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,919
for a test setup we changed very little

213
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,240
about that we had the same type of setup

214
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,120
except we added a raspberry pi

215
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,280
in the middle of the connection between

216
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
the device and the router to act as a

217
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,240
man in the middle

218
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,400
to intercept the data traffic going

219
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,160
through that connection

220
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,360
for those who are unfamiliar with the

221
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,039
raspberry pi it's a device that looks

222
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,360
like this it's uh in essence a small

223
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
computer you run

224
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,360
software units that you use to

225
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,039
impersonate an access point and then

226
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,479
also to capture the data

227
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,240
so as i already mentioned we wanted to

228
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,199
take a look at network communications

229
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,280
for network communications we used

230
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,879
wireshark which is a very well known

231
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,520
tool to do the traffic captures

232
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
and there we took a look at the data

233
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,039
that was going through in terms of

234
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,199
quantity but also the protocols that

235
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,919
were being used by the device itself and

236
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,360
we wanted to know whether or not there

237
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,759
was any encryption on that data applied

238
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,840
or

239
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,680
not of course we can also take a look at

240
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,520
the device itself

241
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,280
the device here it is sitting there in

242
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,799
the network running

243
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,839
system and operating system and services

244
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,000
where we wanted to do port scanning with

245
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
nmop on the device we also did some

246
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,919
service discovery with nmop and a

247
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,760
vulnerability scan with nasa's to see

248
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,600
what we could find on the software

249
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,399
on top of that we have the mobile

250
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,800
application that is often used to

251
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,399
interact with these devices

252
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,040
there we took a look at the android app

253
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,320
for the device

254
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
usually we took the android app just for

255
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,240
the ease of use of our testing tool we

256
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,160
used mob sf for the mobile security

257
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,560
framework to do those testing

258
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,160
and it was just much easier to get a

259
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,080
hold of the package for an android app

260
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,000
than for an iphone app

261
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,920
so that's why we went with android uh

262
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,440
with mobizef we performed static

263
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,920
analysis on the application so we took a

264
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,519
look at the permissions that were

265
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,600
requested by an application we took a

266
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,440
look at the domains that could be found

267
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
in the code of the application and also

268
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
whether or not there were any trackers

269
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,800
present on that device

270
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,519
then last but not least there is the web

271
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,920
interface of a device as well a web

272
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
interface well we have actually two

273
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,920
options for those either we have a local

274
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,080
interface running on the device and then

275
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,160
it's accessible over the local network

276
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,320
so it will go from your laptop to the

277
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,399
router to the device and would access it

278
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,320
directly or we would have a cloud

279
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,399
interface where the internet was an

280
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,800
intermediary and the device would be

281
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,640
connected to the internet and then your

282
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,839
laptop would also connect to the

283
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,640
internet to configure it

284
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,720
in the case of a local interface we had

285
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,800
all freedom to do with it what we wanted

286
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,160
in that case we ran a nicto and a burp

287
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,880
suite active scan on it

288
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,560
but on a cloud interface we didn't have

289
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
that freedom that liberty to run those

290
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,560
more aggressive scans

291
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,079
often there was another bug bounty

292
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,240
program available that we could use to

293
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,480
test the cloud interface uh so in those

294
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,200
cases we had to rely on quality ssl apps

295
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,040
just to check the tls configuration of

296
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,839
that web interface and see if we could

297
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,440
derive anything about the security of

298
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,680
the interface from the configuration of

299
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,959
tls on that platform

300
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,040
if then take a look at the results

301
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
you will see that when we start with

302
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,360
looking at the network communications

303
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
there were quite a few differences in

304
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
the amount of data sent by each of these

305
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
devices and sometimes that makes a lot

306
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,640
of sense a voice assistant or a camera

307
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,399
is a device that is constantly streaming

308
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,399
data for the network to the cloud

309
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,640
interface uh in those cases it makes a

310
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,079
lot of sense that there's this amount of

311
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,839
data going through

312
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,839
but then again we also have

313
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,800
um some less uh active devices i would

314
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,279
say are less data heavy devices like the

315
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,920
doorbell uh that we're still consuming

316
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,480
quite a lot of data

317
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
especially here we see that the light

318
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,920
bulbs and the doorbell have almost equal

319
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,240
amounts of data quite high still on the

320
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,040
list

321
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,800
and that was rather surprising for us

322
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,360
if we then look at the used protocols by

323
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
the devices we see that the vast

324
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,040
majority of traffic is raw tcp and raw

325
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,600
udp

326
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,839
that means that wireshark didn't

327
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,240
recognize the protocol that was running

328
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,440
on top of

329
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
the raw tcp or udp that was being used

330
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
by the device either because it was an

331
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,120
unknown protocol or it was because the

332
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,800
data was encrypted and it just didn't

333
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
recognize it

334
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,880
but then again if we expect encrypted

335
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,560
traffic we would think that even there

336
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,880
they would use standardized protocol and

337
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,320
that's then the runner-up in our

338
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
analysis we see that tls

339
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,959
was being used in a lot of cases as well

340
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,440
most of the time that was tls version

341
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,800
1.2

342
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
but sometimes we also had some

343
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,360
stragglers as devices with tls version

344
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,160
one

345
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,560
or a few devices that were ahead of the

346
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,800
others with cls version 1.3

347
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,519
as i mentioned we wanted to know if the

348
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,839
data was encrypted or not and since we

349
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,800
only had the info raw tcp or raw udp to

350
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,760
go on

351
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,160
we did some extra analysis on those

352
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,000
network communications

353
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,680
in more specifically we took a box plot

354
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,839
of all of the data that went through it

355
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,079
in terms of entropy of that

356
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,800
data stream so if you have for each

357
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,240
vertical box plot there is one device

358
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
we took that data stream in its entirety

359
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,519
and we would look at each stream's

360
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,160
informational entropy a higher entropy

361
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,760
meaning it's likely going to be

362
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,800
encrypted or at least

363
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,120
compressed in some way or another and

364
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,519
lower scores indicating that it's likely

365
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,760
very structured data indicating plain

366
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,639
text or something very

367
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,160
very structured something that repeats

368
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
itself all the time

369
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
if we then draw a line almost in the

370
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,720
middle of this bar we see that on the

371
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
tcp side the vast majority was on the

372
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
encrypted side

373
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,720
but for udp streams we see that

374
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,959
quite a lot of the data was unencrypted

375
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,560
one explanation that we could think of

376
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,399
for that is that a lot of the dns

377
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,639
traffic sent by a device is largely

378
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,040
unencrypted and would fall under the udp

379
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,319
streams side of bins

380
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,480
then i also mentioned that we would do a

381
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
port scan and a vulnerability scan on

382
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,079
each device with

383
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,040
nmop

384
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,959
uh on the left you can see the results

385
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,240
of that uh and mob tried very hard to

386
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,920
find out which services were running on

387
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,720
the devices but most of the time they

388
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,680
would come up uncertain or as unknown

389
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,279
and on the right we see the results of

390
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,399
our nessus come where the vast majority

391
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,240
of the vulnerabilities that we found

392
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,480
were not vulnerabilities at all

393
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,040
they just were informational findings

394
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,199
and in a very very small amount of cases

395
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,720
we actually found some

396
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,120
medium severity vulnerabilities and we

397
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,959
pondered some time on what this could

398
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,040
mean for us but in fact we came to the

399
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
conclusion that it means that we can't

400
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,120
really trust these tools to begin with

401
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,839
it doesn't mean that these

402
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,680
vulnerabilities are not there it just

403
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,079
means an automated tool is likely not

404
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,839
going to be very useful

405
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,079
to determine

406
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,760
what kind of vulnerabilities are present

407
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,920
on a device just because it's using

408
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,399
unknown protocols custom protocols that

409
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,800
are not recognized by these tools so if

410
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
you want to have a very good view on

411
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
vulnerabilities there you would have to

412
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,959
do a manual search and dentist for them

413
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,079
next in the line we see mobile

414
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,360
applications

415
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
my mobile applications as i already

416
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,199
mentioned we took a look at trackers

417
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,120
present in the device and the vast

418
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,680
majority there would be google firebase

419
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,399
analytics or google crashlytics

420
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,240
these are often used to analyze how an

421
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,839
app is used and to make the experience

422
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,160
better or to find out why a crash

423
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,959
occurred and then try to book fix it

424
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,360
but then very closely followed by those

425
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,720
two leaders we have the very well-known

426
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,360
advertising trackers that are also still

427
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
present in these applications that was

428
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,040
rather surprising to us that we would

429
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,800
find this many trackers in them

430
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,320
considering that if you buy a smart

431
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,480
device you already paid for it once

432
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,000
and then again you seem to be paying

433
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,680
with your data nevertheless when you

434
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,959
install the application on your phone

435
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,079
these applications also get access to

436
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,360
quite a lot of

437
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,720
infrastructure or

438
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,800
functionality of your device

439
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,600
um in a lot of the cases it will have to

440
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,880
ask the user for a permission to do so

441
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,920
so in the android case we have two types

442
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,000
of permissions that we define we have

443
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
dangerous permissions and normal

444
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,639
permissions as indicated on the slides

445
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,560
when a permission is marked as dangerous

446
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
according to androids it's any type of

447
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,720
permission that could have an impact on

448
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,320
the data of the user

449
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,920
leak the data of the user or send it

450
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
over to the internet and sometimes it

451
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,519
doesn't mean that

452
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,519
the application permission even if it's

453
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,199
smart as dangerous is

454
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,279
not asked for a legitimate reason for

455
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,440
example internet access would be

456
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,759
qualified as a dangerous permission even

457
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,000
though obviously all of these apps

458
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,720
needed to function properly but in some

459
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,120
cases we still found that there were

460
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,600
quite some surprising amount of

461
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,839
application permissions requested by

462
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,519
these apps

463
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,360
most notably we see that the smart

464
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,519
device hubs and the voice assistants

465
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,199
they score very high on that

466
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,399
and in those cases it might be

467
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,160
defensible that they need access to your

468
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,519
microphone your camera or your location

469
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,519
to provide certain functionality but

470
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,040
then if we look a bit lower on the list

471
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,959
we also see that an application for

472
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,120
light bulbs requested those permissions

473
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,279
as well a very high amount

474
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,679
more notably one light bulb asked for

475
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,679
microphone permissions or camera

476
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,280
permissions and that's something that we

477
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,039
didn't really expect to see

478
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,559
on an application for that type of

479
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,959
products

480
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,880
then when we take a look at the web

481
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,799
interfaces

482
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,720
for the local ones we found some

483
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,480
interesting results

484
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,400
there we saw that on the local web

485
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,760
interfaces that we could access with

486
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,400
burp suites we either had very severe

487
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,679
vulnerabilities or again nothing at all

488
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,039
most of the vulnerabilities that came

489
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,400
out of this were the clear text

490
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
submission of passwords or just

491
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,799
unencrypted communications in general

492
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,880
and that was the case on quite a few of

493
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,679
these devices

494
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,000
also on the other side of them uh that's

495
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,799
pendulum we see that uh even if there

496
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,640
are some very severe vulnerabilities

497
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
found all the other findings were

498
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
largely informational and we couldn't

499
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,360
really derive anything from those either

500
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,600
so for their uh for those

501
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,320
web interfaces we think or we believe

502
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,840
that it's likely that the manufacturer

503
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,520
didn't feel like they needed to

504
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
implement encryption or tls on the local

505
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,240
interface because most of the time it's

506
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,720
only used within the local network

507
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,280
but again we would say that that's

508
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,360
not always the case we see so many

509
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,600
devices just exposed on the internet

510
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,000
over for example web engines like

511
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,280
showdown

512
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,760
where we think that

513
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,120
there is really no excuse not to be

514
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,360
using https on those devices even if

515
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,320
it's a local interface

516
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,679
then we arrive at the privacy

517
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,360
and there we tested two main things

518
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,640
the first one is under the gdpr data

519
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
subject access requests or very simply

520
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,320
put

521
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,039
your right as a consumer to

522
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,559
ask the manufacturer of a device who is

523
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,559
processing your data to have a copy of

524
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,679
that data and also to remove it

525
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,840
and then on the other hand we tested the

526
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,320
privacy policy for each of these devices

527
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,480
so for a data subject access request we

528
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
would send a very simple request to ask

529
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,320
all of our data

530
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,600
and we would ask some additional

531
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
questions on top of that about the data

532
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,880
processing

533
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
we would then check how easy it was to

534
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,760
file that subject access requests

535
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,440
how complete the answer from the

536
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,640
manufacturer was and how complete the

537
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,600
returned data of that manufacturer was

538
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,880
when we took a look at the privacy

539
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
policy there we took a look at the

540
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,960
accessibility of the policy how easy it

541
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
was to find it

542
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
we took a look at the up-to-dateness of

543
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,600
that policy the last time it was updated

544
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
to see if the the data in that policy

545
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,200
was still accurate

546
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,360
and also to see if it was complete under

547
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,440
the gdpr there are a few articles that

548
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,600
very concretely specify which

549
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,360
information should be in a privacy

550
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,760
policy or otherwise communicated to the

551
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
data subject and we would check those

552
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,600
policies to see if all the information

553
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,399
was present

554
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,000
then if we take a look at the results on

555
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,240
the privacy front

556
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,120
we see that it was quite often very

557
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,919
difficult to find the compact details of

558
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,360
a manufacturer

559
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,840
in a lot of the cases we saw that

560
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,679
there was a privacy policy quite easily

561
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,360
accessible on the website but then it

562
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,840
was for the wrong region or it was

563
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,600
completely outdated and they referred to

564
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,760
a new one that was much more difficult

565
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,880
to find

566
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,280
in some other cases

567
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,080
they

568
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,919
only had the scope of their website in

569
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,159
the privacy policy and their product was

570
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,600
not in scope of it

571
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,440
so it turned out to be quite difficult

572
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,919
to find a definitive

573
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,320
policy

574
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,919
and then even if we did find the policy

575
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,120
it didn't always have the contact

576
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,240
details

577
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,400
so we needed to know how to file our

578
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,120
access request of course and then

579
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,360
we would email either their privacy

580
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,280
department or their dpo

581
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,799
in some cases we couldn't find these

582
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,480
details at all and then we just emailed

583
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,120
to their info address on the website but

584
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,960
in most of the cases after some finding

585
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,120
we then ended up having a contact person

586
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
if we then look at how many of these

587
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,960
manufacturers replied to our requests

588
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,360
we see that about one third of these

589
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,880
manufacturers even though they had

590
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,120
plenty of time multiple months to reply

591
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,120
to our request they never replied to us

592
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,720
and then even if we look at the ones

593
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,640
that did reply

594
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,000
we see that

595
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,799
in most of the cases they would not give

596
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,559
a very complete answer to questions or

597
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,159
not even at all

598
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,679
some of these manufacturers would just

599
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,000
dump all the data on top of you in a csv

600
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,039
format

601
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,200
and not answer your questions anymore

602
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,640
others would try to answer your

603
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,480
questions or just refer to the privacy

604
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,039
policy but in almost none of the cases

605
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,600
they were satisfactory or fully complete

606
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,840
in their reply only in a very small

607
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,400
amount of cases did we get a full

608
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,520
email with replies

609
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,960
i already mentioned that most of the

610
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,720
time they would just dump a csv file on

611
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,039
you with all of your data

612
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,559
but even if we look at the completeness

613
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,960
of that data we see that in most of the

614
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,960
cases it was very very dissatisfactory

615
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,880
most of these companies would just give

616
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,960
you back the data that you give them in

617
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,039
the first place which is a good first

618
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,200
step but of course you also expect them

619
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,640
to give you all the data that they

620
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,480
derived from you that they gathered on

621
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,080
you over the

622
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,360
time frame that you've been using their

623
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,520
device and that was quite often either

624
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
very underrepresented or just not

625
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,039
present in the data that they gave you

626
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:29,840
back

627
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,240
even if we would ask for it specifically

628
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,840
uh either we would not get a reply

629
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,679
anymore or they would just say that they

630
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,159
didn't have it um which we obviously

631
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,600
obviously cannot prove that they don't

632
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,559
have it

633
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,000
but we can suspect that they do

634
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,799
if we take a look at the privacy

635
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,720
policies i already mentioned that it was

636
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,960
often quite difficult to find the policy

637
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
in the first place

638
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
uh but on top of that when we did find

639
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,320
one we

640
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,720
checked those articles in gdpr for each

641
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
of these requirements to see what was

642
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
present in the policy or not

643
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
if you want to read this table so we

644
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,559
have every device we come here and then

645
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,440
we have the requirements listed up here

646
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,000
so for alarm one we can see that quite a

647
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
lot of the requirements were met some of

648
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,120
them were not

649
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,039
and the tilde sign in orange here means

650
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,240
that it was either implied or it was

651
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
probably not necessary and some of these

652
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
are conditional so if we think it wasn't

653
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,559
necessary to list that requirement on

654
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,600
the

655
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,960
policy we would either mark it as a

656
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,880
tilde or because it was implied but not

657
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,200
specifically mentioned

658
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,559
there are two things that we can get out

659
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,760
of this table the first one is that for

660
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,720
alarm 2 there was nothing at all in the

661
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,559
policy that should have been there and

662
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,320
for the voice assistant

663
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,240
almost all of the elements that need to

664
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
be covered were present in the policy so

665
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,320
we see a large gap in maturity between

666
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,480
these two some of them scored very well

667
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,640
and others scored very poorly and there

668
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,240
was not really a middle ground it was

669
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,960
either one or the other

670
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,880
of course we can also check on which of

671
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,039
these requirements scored the best and

672
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,799
which of these requirements scored the

673
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,200
worst and if we take a look at which of

674
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,000
the gdpr requirements were largely not

675
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,520
present in policies even though we

676
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,039
thought they should have been

677
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,480
we see that for article 13 1 gdpr

678
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,039
there's the requirements uh there i

679
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,360
have d where the processing is based on

680
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,440
point f of article six the legitimate

681
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
interest pursued by the controller or by

682
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,520
a third party need to be present in the

683
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
privacy policy so what that means is

684
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,120
that if your controller your data

685
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,360
controller says they process your data

686
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,679
based on their own legitimate interests

687
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,279
they need to tell you what these

688
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,039
legitimate interests are

689
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,080
and quite quite often we saw that

690
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,760
manufacturing would just say reprocess

691
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,840
your data based on legitimate interest

692
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,600
but they wouldn't list which legitimate

693
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,440
interest that that would be or they

694
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,760
would stay very very vague and then we

695
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,919
would disqualify it as a good answer

696
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,559
then if we take a look at article 13 2

697
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,679
gdpr we also have two other requirements

698
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,640
more likely here e and f

699
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,440
the

700
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
requirement e is whether the provision

701
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,520
of personal data is a statutory or

702
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,000
contractual requirement in other words

703
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,919
if it's required to give your personal

704
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,600
data to them um either to uh to do so

705
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,760
under law or under contact that you have

706
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,559
with them and also if it is necessary to

707
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,960
enter into that contract with them

708
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,480
that was something that was quite often

709
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
implied they would just imply that yes

710
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,000
you need to give them your data if you

711
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,919
want to use their products but it was

712
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,720
never explicitly in the policy just in

713
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,039
one case

714
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,600
then we also have article 132 paragraph

715
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,919
f of gdpr where the existence of

716
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,600
automated decision making needs to be

717
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,320
told to you including profiling if they

718
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,720
do it and there many of them never

719
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
mentioned automated decision making at

720
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,080
all they didn't say whether or not they

721
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,919
did it it was just not present in the

722
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,039
policy

723
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,840
whatsoever

724
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,240
so what can we learn from all of this

725
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
well for security we have three

726
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,080
conclusions

727
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,840
the first one is that it's quite a hit

728
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,320
or miss with these devices we see that a

729
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,960
very few security measures are taken on

730
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,880
some of these devices as opposed to

731
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
others who have a very solid security

732
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,320
implementation and that there's really

733
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,799
no middle grounds usually when security

734
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,799
is considered for a device it's

735
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,640
considered across the board

736
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,880
and otherwise it's also just not a

737
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,640
concern for a manufacturer then you will

738
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,720
see no security anywhere on the device

739
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,120
as a second point we had a lot of

740
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,880
assessment difficulties

741
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
as i already mentioned a lot of these

742
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,039
devices use non-standard technologies

743
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,679
they use non-conventional cryptography

744
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,960
and there's quite often no proper

745
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,120
documentation about them on the internet

746
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,279
or at least not publicly available

747
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,279
so it's very difficult to find out how

748
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,960
to assess the security on one of these

749
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,400
devices

750
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,320
quite often they used security by

751
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,600
obscurity

752
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,760
and that's something that we would

753
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,159
always be against

754
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,360
as the only security especially

755
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,840
in this case we don't have a good way of

756
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,159
finding out which devices are secure and

757
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,480
which ones are not

758
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,400
so what can you as a consumer look out

759
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,320
for when you're in the store wanting to

760
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,559
buy a device nobody would recommend to

761
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,880
go for a known brand that has a

762
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,399
reputation to defend

763
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,159
and we see two types of devices on the

764
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,640
market we have devices that don't have a

765
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,120
very well-known brand that move on to a

766
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,440
new technology really quickly

767
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,600
that maybe today is making smart ip

768
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,279
cameras and tomorrow they'll be making

769
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,360
smart doorbells and in a few months

770
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,000
later they'll be making baby monitors

771
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,600
and there they they really don't care

772
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,760
about the security of their past

773
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,600
products because their name is just not

774
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,799
attached to it

775
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,480
if you go for a known brand that has

776
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,120
that reputation to work for you at least

777
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
know that if a security vulnerability a

778
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,600
high profile one is found in that device

779
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,679
they will work on fixing it towards the

780
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,679
future

781
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,080
as a second point we recommend that you

782
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,159
look at the transparency about security

783
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,760
before your purchase

784
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,240
if you can find on their website notice

785
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,399
about security or even the entire manual

786
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,240
and it has a sectional security of the

787
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,559
device outlined that's already a very

788
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,960
good sign because it shows that at least

789
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,799
security was given some thought when

790
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,640
they were making the device

791
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,080
and that means that you as a consumer

792
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,240
also have some options to improve the

793
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,279
security of the device

794
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,360
then as a last point we see that

795
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,679
automatic updates are very important not

796
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,919
just in general but especially for these

797
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,520
devices because many people buy a smart

798
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,919
camera a smart tv and so on and they put

799
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,679
it on the network and as long as it

800
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,840
keeps working they never update it if

801
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,679
the device is not going to ask about

802
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,000
updating it then you will just as a user

803
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,399
let it sit there until it breaks

804
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,960
and that means that if you buy a device

805
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,679
even if it's secure today that in two

806
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,600
years likely a vulnerability will have

807
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,679
been found and it's not secure anymore

808
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,600
so if you can get automatic updates on

809
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,440
those devices it's one less thing on

810
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,919
your to-do list and it's one more thing

811
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,919
that the device is keeping itself secure

812
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
when we take a look at privacy we

813
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,399
actually see that same gap in maturity

814
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,559
arise again we see that some of these

815
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,240
manufacturers were at least putting in

816
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,720
an effort to be gdpr compliant not

817
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,039
always successful granted but at least

818
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,200
they would try and some others were not

819
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,679
gdpr compliant at all

820
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,840
that gap was mostly notable for

821
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,440
countries that were outside of the

822
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,520
european union and had less affinity

823
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,840
with european legal framework where it

824
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,399
was really much of a this is too far

825
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,080
from me story

826
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,480
and they just didn't know that they were

827
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,559
in the scope of gdpr or they didn't care

828
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,960
about it

829
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,679
then we also see a shift in mentality

830
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,279
i added a reference on the bottom of the

831
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,360
slide here for some very interesting

832
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,600
research by uh historically from car 11

833
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,559
as well

834
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,720
that actually did a very similar test

835
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,000
about data subject access rights in the

836
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,880
time before gdpr went into force to see

837
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,840
what they would get as a reply from

838
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,880
companies

839
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
and they were really met in their paper

840
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,000
they described being met with very mean

841
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,760
replies some of these manufacturers

842
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
would say please stop bothering us this

843
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,520
is exactly why we didn't incorporate in

844
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,279
the eu or

845
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,120
we just don't have time for this or they

846
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,399
would just get yelled at or they didn't

847
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,919
get a reply at all

848
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,000
and that really changed all of our

849
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,320
replies that we received were very

850
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,159
friendly towards us even though they

851
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,320
were not always useful they would still

852
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,480
at least try to be useful

853
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,559
so that's a very big shift in mentality

854
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,200
that we've spotted uh compared to before

855
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,679
gdpr

856
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,679
and last but not least we think that as

857
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,600
i already mentioned there's that gap in

858
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,720
maturity there is a need for enforcement

859
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,120
on the gdpr front at the moment there's

860
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,799
too little transparency about legal

861
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,960
sanctions for companies that are not

862
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,799
compliant with gdpr

863
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,880
so even if they get fined not enough

864
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
people know about it not enough other

865
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,080
companies know about it and it just

866
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,320
doesn't have enough visibility

867
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,240
on top of that we see that there's not

868
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,720
sufficient funding for dpas to

869
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
adequately investigate all of the leaks

870
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,799
that they get and most of the time they

871
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,799
might be flooded with reports but they

872
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,159
have to choose which ones they can

873
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,519
handle and which ones they don't have

874
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,279
time for

875
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,960
and on top of that we see that that

876
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
leads to no meaningful enforcement of

877
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,600
gdpr outside of the european economic

878
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,559
area

879
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,159
if they already have their hands full

880
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,480
with just going after the companies in

881
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,760
the european union that are not

882
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,399
compliant and companies outside of it

883
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,039
are usually getting off pretty easily

884
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,159
and that means that they also don't

885
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,000
really have a very big incentive to be

886
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,880
gpr compliant

887
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,559
and that brings us to the conclusion of

888
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,880
regulation that's what we wanted to

889
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,640
answer today we wanted to know if

890
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,480
regulation for the security of those

891
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,360
devices is needed specifically for them

892
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,480
we see that

893
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,640
we feel a need for a baseline of binding

894
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,679
rules

895
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,720
we feel that there should be

896
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,880
certification to verify the minimum

897
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,559
security requirements are fulfilled on

898
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,039
these devices and to keep that workable

899
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,200
to keep that verifiable we think that it

900
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
should be based on standardized hardened

901
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,679
baseline components and you cannot

902
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,440
verify the security of each and every

903
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,519
device before it goes to markets but we

904
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,640
feel like

905
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,880
we can get a good baseline going by

906
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,559
having standardized components that we

907
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,559
know are secure and making sure that

908
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,480
manufacturers use those to build their

909
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,320
products

910
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,720
on top of that we feel like a deep dive

911
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,640
is also possible in the form of iot

912
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,279
labels an iot label could be an

913
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,000
additional indicator for consumer that a

914
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,640
device went the extra mile for security

915
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,240
but it could also be a competition point

916
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
for manufacturers who want to stand out

917
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,080
from their competition

918
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,559
and that's also not a strange concept

919
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,320
those labels have existed in many

920
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,640
sectors now so we don't see a reason why

921
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,200
it wouldn't be available for iot devices

922
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,000
as well

923
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,519
so if we look at the future where do we

924
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,919
go from here with this conclusion well

925
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,240
in fact with the new well it's not very

926
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,640
new anymore but the recently passed eu

927
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,840
cyber security acts um it gives anissa a

928
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,320
new mandate to provide standardization

929
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
frameworks and certification frameworks

930
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,080
for cyber security

931
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,159
some time ago they released just one of

932
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,600
those

933
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,320
the eucc as a candidate scheme for that

934
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,880
certification and in that candidate

935
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,440
scheme they make a reference to a demo

936
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,600
label that you can see here on the

937
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,440
slides that you could put on ict

938
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,399
products

939
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,720
um to to recognize it in the european

940
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,640
union as a secure device

941
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,399
so this is also something that we

942
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,640
applaud of course

943
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,200
and last but not least we see an eva an

944
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,720
evolution in the landscape in the

945
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,320
regulatory landscape

946
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,799
where usually the regulatory landscape

947
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,559
was very focused on critical

948
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,919
infrastructure on uh too big to fail

949
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,159
infrastructure and i.t we see now that

950
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,200
there are more and more regulations also

951
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,000
applying to the smaller companies the

952
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,080
smaller products such as the smart home

953
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,639
devices

954
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,559
as i mentioned this research was done

955
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,800
quite some time ago so we might think if

956
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,560
it's still relevant today

957
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,359
and for that i have a slide over

958
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,119
of a very recent news article here in

959
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,440
belgium uh i'll translate the title for

960
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,079
you it says watch out for cheap smart

961
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,760
devices they are as leaky as a sieve

962
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,320
and that is an article that was aired

963
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,879
after research from k11 and from a very

964
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,839
large

965
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,239
consumer organization where they did

966
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,159
very similar research they also took

967
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,960
those smart devices a list of 16 of them

968
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,879
tested the security and they came to

969
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,800
very very similar conclusions this is an

970
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,960
article from a few weeks ago so it

971
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,440
learns us or it teaches us that nothing

972
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,280
really has changed so far

973
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,480
so i would like to leave you with low

974
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,560
and last slide in this case a quote from

975
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,719
stefan napo at the internet of things

976
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,320
devoid of comprehensive security

977
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,240
management stantomans to the internet of

978
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,160
threats and that's what i believe as

979
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,400
well after doing this research

980
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,880
if you want to get these smart devices

981
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,560
get them by all means but make sure that

982
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,320
you secure them as well

983
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,880
otherwise you're just inviting

984
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,040
nefarious people to break into your

985
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,280
household

986
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,839
thank you

987
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,560
that was an incredible presentation you

988
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,119
got me thinking right from there

989
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,880
so i really

990
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,079
like the way that you test privacy you

991
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,680
know the devices right the way you were

992
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,839
testing you know the data cycle right so

993
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,839
kudos that was an incredible job uh

994
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:36,720
we're going to enjoy you know your

995
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,839
presentation

996
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,119
thank you

997
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:39,920
so

998
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,000
paulo i'm not sure if you've got any

999
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,400
questions if not for one

1000
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,560
we don't have yet any questions from the

1001
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,440
norm for those likes from normal here in

1002
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,920
the in the zone but you can go on i also

1003
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,079
have a couple of questions

1004
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,920
myself because i also found really

1005
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,400
interesting stuff

1006
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,920
when you were talking about the doorbell

1007
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,000
right so you got me curious there

1008
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,240
do you know the reasons why the dope was

1009
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,440
sending so much traffic to the internet

1010
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,920
um the doorbell it had one excuse

1011
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,079
although uh it's not a very solid one so

1012
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,760
it was a it was a video doorbell and it

1013
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,920
would activate on movement

1014
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,920
so there might have been some movement

1015
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,280
in the room that we used to test it

1016
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,440
although we tested it over 24 hour idle

1017
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,960
periods so it was sitting in the corner

1018
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,119
of a room nothing was moving there

1019
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,720
unless it somehow would trigger the

1020
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,200
motion sensor anyway there was really no

1021
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,720
reason why that device would be sending

1022
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,320
video footage um so it's uh it's a good

1023
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,480
question i don't know exactly why it was

1024
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,400
sending that much data um but it's

1025
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,680
something that we did observe now

1026
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,079
okay

1027
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,880
i want to ask like a couple of questions

1028
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,359
one is like uh

1029
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,599
did you did you talk about the

1030
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,480
auto updates of the devices did you test

1031
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,119
how many of them were actually

1032
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,720
updating themselves and providing

1033
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,079
security patches

1034
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,240
you have them some yeah

1035
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,760
that's a good question we didn't

1036
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,359
formally test it so i don't have any

1037
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,079
numbers on that um but i did

1038
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,520
i did keep it in mind when i was testing

1039
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,200
the devices of course and i looked into

1040
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,760
it and the vast majority that we tested

1041
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,720
did not have automatic updates um

1042
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,640
mostly the voice assistants they would

1043
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,760
have automatic updates um the smart lock

1044
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,680
would also automatically update

1045
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,640
um

1046
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
and then it would basically be either

1047
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,160
triggered via the mobile app so it was

1048
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,520
not automatic you would have to do it

1049
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,599
manually or in

1050
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,359
the even worse cases you would have to

1051
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,599
push firmware as a binary to the web

1052
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,760
interface via uploads

1053
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,000
um so those are the the really the the

1054
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,520
most difficult ones to update you would

1055
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,720
at first have to go to the website to

1056
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,640
download the binary and manually push it

1057
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,160
to the device

1058
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,440
yeah so totally manual updates yeah

1059
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,079
and

1060
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,520
the other the other thing is like do you

1061
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,599
have any advice like i guess like to do

1062
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,760
to do one on

1063
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,920
like it's all like these these devices

1064
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,520
are

1065
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
secure a bit like if you

1066
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,160
you're not so sure

1067
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,000
so it really depends on your internet

1068
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,599
environment at home and how tech savvy

1069
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,000
you are um if you if you have the

1070
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,760
knowledge on your network to set up a

1071
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,000
dmz for these devices at the militarized

1072
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,359
zone we would recommend putting them in

1073
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,200
there especially if you don't trust the

1074
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,320
device we would also um

1075
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,160
recommend never to connect it to the

1076
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,240
internet as tempting as it might be um

1077
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
well let's let me put that a different

1078
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,960
way not to expose it to the internet so

1079
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,520
not let it accept outwards or incoming

1080
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,200
connections from the outside

1081
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,560
um

1082
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,320
that's already something that you can do

1083
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,560
that that really captures a lot of the

1084
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,960
the threat

1085
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,880
and sometimes it's very very tempting to

1086
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,560
do that because for example the ip

1087
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,079
camera it's really convenient if you can

1088
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,079
consult it from outside of the house

1089
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,839
um but at the same time if you can

1090
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,680
consult it from outside of the house

1091
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,119
then somebody can probably find it on

1092
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,160
showdown

1093
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,560
and then log into it as well

1094
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,160
so that's really a trade-off and

1095
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,839
functionality versus security there that

1096
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,760
you could have to make of course there

1097
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,520
are cameras as well that connect via a

1098
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,440
cloud interface and and communicate with

1099
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,800
a very secure channel so it's not

1100
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,320
impossible to consult from outside of

1101
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,240
the house but be careful how you do it

1102
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,160
okay

1103
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,760
thanks a lot uh

1104
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,640
it was really interesting presentation

1105
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,599
i'm gonna find out final question the

1106
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,760
were you when you were selecting the uh

1107
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,480
the devices for your test were you

1108
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,400
looking for specific vendors right

1109
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,240
because you were saying right you know

1110
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,480
the uh we're talking about the gdpr that

1111
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,560
depending on the value that the european

1112
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,200
vendor versus you know a vendor outside

1113
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,880
of the european union

1114
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,040
maybe you know those the um specific

1115
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,720
data requirements you know might be

1116
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,640
taking you know in in a different way

1117
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,560
from one to another so i wonder you know

1118
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,200
how did you select you know your pool of

1119
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,320
vendors you know for basis um most of

1120
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,640
the time we wanted to know uh to have a

1121
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,119
device of a very recognized brand uh so

1122
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,560
one of the major vendors that you can

1123
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,960
imagine when i say smart home to you

1124
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,560
and then we also took one from a lesser

1125
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,240
known vendor maybe sometimes even from a

1126
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,079
white brand that just didn't put a brand

1127
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,920
name on the device to see if there was a

1128
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,680
notable difference between the two and

1129
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,040
that's also where our recommendation

1130
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,800
came from to go for the more known

1131
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,440
brands not to say that any device

1132
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
without a brand on it is insecure that's

1133
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,520
not true there might be secure ones out

1134
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,560
there as well

1135
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,000
but the vast majority of the ones that

1136
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,599
we tested didn't really pay a lot of

1137
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,440
attention to security

1138
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,599
of the device and if you have a vendor

1139
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,920
that really cares about their reputation

1140
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,200
that is a lot different

1141
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,920
that's interesting you know yeah

1142
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,640
[Music]

1143
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,880
cool so thank you so much you know for

1144
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,319
your presentation that was great
