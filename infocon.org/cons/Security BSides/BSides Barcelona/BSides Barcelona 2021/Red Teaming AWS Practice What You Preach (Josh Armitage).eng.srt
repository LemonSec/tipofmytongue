something so i can't wait

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,840
here to learn more you know about it and

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,800
oh the floor is yours good luck

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,880
thank you very much thanks guys

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,360
all right hopefully i know we're uh

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,960
towards the tail end of a two-day

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,719
conference i'll try and keep this upbeat

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,160
as much as you can

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,920
in a remote sense

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,280
it's a shame because i absolutely love

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,200
barcelona as a city yeah unfortunately

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,719
we had to do this full remote as we have

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,719
for the last couple of years right

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,480
it's a shame and don't worry if you are

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,559
feeling a bit tired the bit that

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,000
everyone remembers from this talk comes

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,760
in the first 20 seconds and i'll get to

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,280
that now

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,559
so

27
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,280
this is amazing a word amazing word in

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,640
japanese

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,719
called tsujigiri

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,119
and so far no one's ever known what this

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,960
meant when i first said it but no one

32
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,200
ever forgets it when i tell them

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,799
and normally i ask the crowd there isn't

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,960
one but this is fine but the definition

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,000
for it is

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720
is trying out a new samurai sword on a

37
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
random passerby

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,640
kind of a weirdly specific term and is

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,159
based on actual history and that's what

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,159
samurai actually did

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,720
and that's the kind of ethos and spirit

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,560
we took into kind of the story i'm gonna

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,520
go into today

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,079
unfortunately i have to do an obligatory

45
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,079
about me slide because my ego won't

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,560
allow me to not so who am i

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,799
i'm josh armitage i'm the adress

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,600
practice lead at cantino cantino ra

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,119
global digital transformation

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,680
consultancy we work with highly regular

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
enterprises we're talking the the

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,600
biggest of the big

53
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,840
why you should listen to me about

54
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,280
security i lived in a prison colony for

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,600
13 years most people know that as

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,240
australia but it still works right

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,680
and also i am um the author of the cloud

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,360
native security cookbook with o'reilly

59
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,200
that's coming out in about may the next

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
year so i normally don't have any

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,720
weekends anymore because i'm busy

62
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,359
writing that

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,560
what this talk really is about

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,800
is shift left learning

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,319
and we always talk about shift left and

66
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,560
security and bringing the tools so you

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,879
find the problems quicker

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,480
really this is about what happens when

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,239
you try and bring the learning and the

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,599
experience

71
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,160
to happen quicker right

72
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
you know everyone's seen this kind of

73
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
curve before this graph is nothing new

74
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,560
but you know over time cost doesn't

75
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,040
increase linearly it increases

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,720
exponentially

77
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,800
and what do we do if so if you can bring

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,959
the learning earlier

79
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,200
can we get that same kind of cost

80
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,959
benefit the things get a lot better if

81
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,760
we bring it forward

82
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,319
now i'm just going to go through quickly

83
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,080
a few different mental models that i

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
like to use in this space so hopefully

85
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
when i talk about other things we're all

86
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,560
kind of singing from the same nim sheet

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,080
so the first is the knowledge buckets

88
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,319
which came from a i normally look this

89
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,360
up but i can't remember now i think it

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,400
was a

91
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,239
secretary of defense in the us

92
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,080
effectively and he said there's three

93
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,640
kinds of knowledge you've got your

94
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,879
known knowns you've got your known

95
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,760
unknowns and your unknown unknowns so

96
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,879
effectively

97
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,040
the things you know that you know

98
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,000
the things that you know you don't know

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,159
and the things you don't know you don't

100
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,920
know yet and normally the unknown

101
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,400
unknown is the really interesting piece

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,239
of almost doing anything

103
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,200
because it's all the stuff you didn't

104
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,640
even know you didn't know right

105
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,360
so

106
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,440
we're going to go through what for this

107
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,519
what the known knowns were so the story

108
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,920
i'm going to talk about today

109
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680
is what happened

110
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,720
when

111
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,879
uh at the consultancy i was at in the

112
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,120
previous life in the pre-pandemic world

113
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,239
australia where we took the case of what

114
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,280
happens if we attack our own aws

115
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,760
environment but don't tell the majority

116
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,319
of the company that's what we're doing

117
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,799
what happens how do they react all that

118
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,239
kind of stuff right and this was

119
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,238
instigated by the ceo i've had the

120
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,478
question before like did people know

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,000
well the

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,440
ceo ceo and cto told me to do it so i

123
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,280
took it as i can do this and this is

124
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,720
fine i'm not going to get pulled up the

125
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,400
next day right

126
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
and we had a bunch of known knowns or

127
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
things we believe

128
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,960
that we knew that were true

129
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,720
one thing that was really important to

130
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,280
us was security is everyone's

131
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,759
responsibility it's not your security

132
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,600
functions responsibility it's not the

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,919
engineering it's everyone everyone has

134
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,520
to be part of security everyone has to

135
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,479
be

136
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,400
as good as they can be within reasonable

137
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,360
limits

138
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,160
for security to be effective

139
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,800
the second thing that we had was we had

140
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,360
a defined instant response process is

141
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,039
pretty much every business especially

142
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,680
technology business under the sun has

143
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,320
right it's in the paging confluence

144
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,160
where it was in this case

145
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,919
people read it and they sign off on it

146
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,360
and maybe they're forced to read it

147
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
every six months or something but

148
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,520
do people remember it when the pressure

149
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,960
is on does that really happen

150
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,000
this now seems like a luxury in modern

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,880
times back back in 2019 when we first

152
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,080
did this

153
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,680
we were able to all be together and

154
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,759
co-locate we were a consultancy

155
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,080
naturally we were split across

156
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,919
a variety of different places across the

157
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,680
city where we were

158
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,440
for this

159
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,880
we didn't want to add the extra

160
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,280
complexity of everyone being desperately

161
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,759
and also people being on client side

162
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,280
this was something we wanted to invest

163
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,880
in as a company

164
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,520
we had about 30 people at the time

165
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,240
we pulled everyone off clients for that

166
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,400
day they didn't know this was happening

167
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
but the company effectively said we're

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
going to make zero money this day

169
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,680
because this is important to us

170
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,360
and i'll kind of i'll go on about that a

171
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,280
bit because this is part of the power of

172
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,199
this

173
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,600
another thing that we thought we knew we

174
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,039
thought we know what we thought to a

175
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,039
degree we knew what people would do

176
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,600
we thought we knew who would step up

177
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
to a degree we thought we knew how they

178
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,120
would try and react

179
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
so naturally

180
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,520
being the red team and being there and

181
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,240
doing os and all that kind of stuff we

182
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,080
started to put safeguards and traps and

183
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,000
stuff in place before the day to catch

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
people when they went down the path we

185
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,120
thought they would and i'll go into

186
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,080
those a little bit as we go along

187
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,479
so then we had a bunch of known unknowns

188
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,319
things we wanted we knew we wanted to

189
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,479
figure out from this

190
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,360
one of the core things when doing this

191
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,600
is how do you measure performance

192
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,039
now when i talk about measuring

193
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,080
performance i'm not talking about

194
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
using this as a stick to hit people like

195
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,800
you didn't do good there was no good bad

196
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,039
or anything in terms of this this was

197
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,680
just so we can measure where we are and

198
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,759
then when we do it again we can see did

199
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,360
we get better did we get worse did we

200
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,039
stay the same

201
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,280
it's not about it's about this

202
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,039
continuous learning

203
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,599
approach to things not about hitting

204
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,280
people for being bad

205
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,960
right it's very much psychological

206
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
safety and that kind of ethos and that

207
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
side of culture so we came up with a few

208
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,840
metrics

209
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,160
the first was time to identify

210
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,800
from us starting the red team activity

211
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,319
seeing that the other everyone else in

212
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,919
the company didn't know it was going to

213
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,800
happen

214
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,720
how long did it take them to figure out

215
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,800
that we were going to do this

216
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,240
and that we were actively doing

217
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,840
something

218
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,160
time to contain how long until they'd

219
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,759
actually contained me and the other

220
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,680
engineer that were the red team how long

221
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,960
till they actually took away all their

222
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,720
access and got it under control to the

223
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,240
point where we couldn't cause any more

224
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,400
mischief going forward

225
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,919
and the third was the percentage of

226
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,800
intrusion detected of everything we did

227
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,599
once they contained it how much stuff of

228
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,960
what we did did they even find

229
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,560
another thing we wanted to understand

230
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,039
was who will take responsibility so as i

231
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,160
said this was instigated by the c-suite

232
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,080
they asked us to do this

233
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,520
and me and the other engineer were two

234
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,360
of the most senior kind of engineers in

235
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,400
the company

236
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,240
so you took effect of your entire

237
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,840
leadership structure

238
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,879
out

239
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,879
so as much as everyone was on site we

240
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,639
actually went next door to a coffee shop

241
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,240
to actually do the red teaming from so

242
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,199
we weren't there so it was a

243
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,639
really interesting

244
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,400
concept of what happens when you take

245
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,479
away the people that everyone normally

246
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,240
looks to in a crisis or something going

247
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,240
wrong what happens who's gonna

248
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
step up into that kind of leadership

249
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,000
vacuum and take control

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,080
another thing that we wanted to

251
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,679
understand was

252
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,360
processes break

253
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
generally when you

254
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,560
are three times the size of what you

255
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,480
were when you put the process in now

256
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,080
when i joined the company we were 10

257
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
people as i said we're about 30 at this

258
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,000
time we kind of had an idea that the

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
processes we had probably weren't going

260
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,160
to work anymore because we'd grown that

261
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,399
much 20 people doesn't sound like a lot

262
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,320
but going from 10 to 30 is a massive

263
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
difference

264
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,880
and the last one was what lenses do

265
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,240
people possess

266
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
now in that third in those 30 people

267
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
we've had a lot of developers we'd hire

268
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
a few operations people were a devops

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,440
consultancy

270
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,160
we hadn't had that many security people

271
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,320
and this was a case of do the engineers

272
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,519
we've hired and the operations people

273
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,080
will be hired can they look at problems

274
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,399
through a security lens

275
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,959
do they have that ability and again in a

276
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,880
way not it's a pro it's not a problem if

277
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,200
they don't because then we know the gap

278
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
and we can fix the gap

279
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,279
but are people be able to look at things

280
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,560
the right way and normally when i talk

281
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,000
at these conferences mostly security

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
people right and then they always

283
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,519
complain about engineers they don't see

284
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,360
the things the same way that they do

285
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,800
it's perfectly legitimate and it is a

286
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
real thing but this was we wanted to

287
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
find if we had any like

288
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,640
security people deep down inside within

289
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,399
our company already that we could look

290
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,720
to build on or exactly where we were

291
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,120
obviously with the unknown unknowns we

292
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,279
didn't know going into it what we were

293
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,640
going to find we knew we'd find things

294
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,480
we didn't know that we knew we're going

295
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,399
to find as we went along

296
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,079
and really what i like to bring this

297
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,000
back to is the same concept behind chaos

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,079
engineering and since i did this

299
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,000
someone else has coined this process the

300
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,760
security chaos engineering which i found

301
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,040
quite interesting because i saw the

302
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,360
o'reilly book on it i'm like oh i miss

303
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,440
my timing on this but that's fine

304
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,720
and now you think it's interesting that

305
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,399
chaos engineering in the operational

306
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,800
space with gremlin and chaos monkey and

307
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,240
the simian army and all that kind of

308
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,120
stuff

309
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,480
is huge

310
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,040
now right like it's a massive thing and

311
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,720
i think from you know

312
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,480
this is kind of like pen testing but

313
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,720
it's also like assume your pen testing

314
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,279
is successful as in you've breached and

315
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,600
you've got into your cloud environment

316
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
what actually happens then

317
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,560
so assume that you your perimeter has

318
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,640
holes because any perimeter of any size

319
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,120
really does you know day zero

320
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,160
events are legitimate things what

321
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,240
happens next if someone gets into your

322
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,839
cloud environment

323
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,120
and i think this chaos engineering

324
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,040
security cast engineering is going to

325
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,560
become more of a thing in the future

326
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,600
if you're looking to do this yourself um

327
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
set up some rules of engagement we did

328
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,800
thankfully we had a maximum bill in

329
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,880
terms of cloud bill we were able to

330
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,480
incur we couldn't just go stand up the

331
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,399
biggest ec2 instances that aws could

332
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,640
provide us and bankrupt the company in a

333
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,200
day we had to focus on keeping it under

334
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,040
control with the amount of money that we

335
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
were spending all that kind of stuff

336
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,480
there were certain things we weren't

337
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,560
allowed to do like we couldn't go and

338
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,760
kill identity effectively and make it so

339
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
the blue team couldn't do anything now

340
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
legitimately someone could have done you

341
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
can do that to a very high degree in

342
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,720
cloud

343
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,560
but that would kind of stop the fun and

344
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,320
the learning it was about

345
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
not about making the blue team feel

346
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,519
awful about themselves because they

347
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,959
couldn't do anything

348
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,720
but get that right level of challenge

349
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,880
and right level of competition that they

350
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,720
always felt they were close

351
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
and we just keep moving that little bit

352
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,399
forward not kind of make them all

353
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,560
depressed after an hour of finding out

354
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,040
they couldn't really do anything right

355
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,160
so with that that's enough of me

356
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,760
practicing on about all mental models

357
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,880
and all that kind of stuff so i'll

358
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,639
actually move into

359
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,440
kind of a replay of the day

360
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
so 10 o'clock in the morning

361
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,959
you've got to let people have caffeine

362
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,480
before you do this otherwise that's

363
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,000
really unfair so let people have the

364
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,519
coffee

365
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,440
and we started

366
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,160
so

367
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,680
one of the things we tried to do and i

368
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
think this was really important

369
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,360
is roy

370
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,120
always looking to how do you channel

371
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,360
learning through people you always run

372
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,880
the risk in these kind of scenarios but

373
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
all the most senior people will go okay

374
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
we're going to solve this they go ahead

375
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,040
and heads down hands on keyboard and all

376
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
the junior people kind of sit back and

377
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,079
go well i'm just going to watch them do

378
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,440
it right

379
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,240
so one of the things we did is prior to

380
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,519
kicking this off one of the first things

381
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,120
we did is we killed every senior

382
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,760
person's access at the company to adress

383
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,200
we left a lot of the junior peoples

384
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
around

385
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,399
but we killed all the senior peoples

386
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,920
with the intent that then the senior

387
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,399
would have to work through the junior

388
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,399
to do what they wanted to do so very

389
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,200
much like a highly driven approach

390
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
for learning like we were big proponents

391
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
of pair programming it was very similar

392
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
to that kind of model but making sure

393
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,600
that the people who had the most to

394
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,320
learn were doing the most work

395
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
um three minutes after we started we

396
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,920
tripped the wire now this was a

397
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,760
serverless consultancy first and

398
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,160
foremost we had an alarm that would say

399
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,399
if someone set up an ec2 machine an

400
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,639
alarm would go off

401
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,800
so we knew we knew how the trip wires

402
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,880
and how to set off some alerts to see if

403
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,920
people would do that we didn't want to

404
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,320
run for two hours before anyone realized

405
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,360
that something was going on right

406
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,279
also at the same time

407
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,000
we sent out a pre-crafted phishing email

408
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,160
from that looked very much like the

409
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,839
compliance tool that we used that

410
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,959
triggered those alerts as well so we did

411
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,480
fish to see if people would click it i'm

412
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,040
sorry to say people did people always do

413
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,399
but it was still you know we wanted to

414
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,160
see the percentage right it just always

415
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,320
happens

416
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,920
so nine minutes after we started someone

417
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,040
noticed

418
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,560
um a guy called paul put his hand up

419
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,000
went okay i think something's going on

420
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,839
i'm going to investigate

421
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,519
he very quickly figures out if he was

422
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,399
one of the most senior people in the

423
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,720
room his access is already gone so he

424
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,920
asked for someone to come and help him

425
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,880
uh zynab went over to help him we in we

426
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,720
instantly blatted her credentials before

427
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,639
she could do anything as well

428
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,639
now i've already said we were in another

429
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,519
room

430
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,040
how did we know what was happening in

431
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
the room

432
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,360
and we actually had a double agent on

433
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
the inside on the blue team side to feed

434
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,120
his information feed us how everything

435
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,639
was going in the room

436
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,480
partly sure we could stay one step ahead

437
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,000
and partly who knew if we needed to pull

438
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,279
back a little bit because the stress

439
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,199
level was running too high or anything

440
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,040
else you know it really is you don't

441
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,480
want to make you want to turn this into

442
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,760
a really positive experience for

443
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,000
everyone not a really negative one

444
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,839
three minutes after that

445
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,079
it was called in the company slight

446
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,519
channel this is not a drill something's

447
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,880
going on everyone needs to stop what

448
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,600
they're doing and come and help

449
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,519
five minutes after that the ceo was

450
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,120
called and i had great fun watching him

451
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,560
sipping a coffee look at this phone and

452
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
put it face down on the table and just

453
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,560
go well i'm not answering

454
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,639
the interesting part was that is step

455
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,760
one of the instant response procedure

456
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,000
was called the ceo that's how long it

457
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,959
took 17 minutes

458
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,399
one of the interesting things that came

459
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,600
out of this and one thing we really

460
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
didn't know was how are people going to

461
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,800
structure themselves when this happened

462
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,079
right you've put people under a lot of

463
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,600
pressure a lot of stress and gone

464
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,839
self-organized

465
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,759
and i think what actually happened is

466
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,120
probably going to be pretty common if

467
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,399
you do this

468
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,480
on the first time is you ended up with

469
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,079
something like this there was one person

470
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,759
paul at the top the initial person to

471
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,920
realize everyone was feeding information

472
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,199
to him

473
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,399
and naturally the next thing that

474
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,759
happened was this

475
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,360
his head

476
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,440
metaphorically set on fire there was too

477
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,959
much information too many people trying

478
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,560
to talk to him everyone was trying to

479
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,160
feed him back information and ask what

480
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,440
to do at the same time and he just went

481
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,839
oh my god i can't handle like something

482
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,160
needs to change

483
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,959
so at 10 28 they went okay let's stop

484
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,880
and regroup let's figure out where we

485
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,399
are what we're trying to do let's get a

486
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,040
bit of thought behind this as opposed to

487
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,000
everyone running around in circles

488
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,240
so at 10 30 they did an access poll so

489
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,880
who's still got access who hasn't that

490
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,480
defines you know how power

491
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,160
what they can do how much they can act

492
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,079
on who they need to kind of be sitting

493
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,600
at keyboards and then when other people

494
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,199
can think about things a little bit more

495
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,639
and then you know kind of work through

496
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,560
them and that kind of stuff

497
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,000
what was interesting with this is

498
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,600
someone said he didn't have access when

499
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,800
he still did

500
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,560
as well which i found quite amusing on

501
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,399
the day that someone didn't feel

502
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,920
confident enough

503
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,519
to do that now we didn't call it out

504
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,680
like publicly but in person you know in

505
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,000
person i went to the guy after when

506
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,079
okay cool like

507
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,839
it's fine that you did but how come i

508
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,920
just want to understand why you weren't

509
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,440
comfortable kind of pointing your hand

510
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,399
up as having access

511
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,559
from there with that organic structure

512
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,760
they split into

513
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,280
design ab the person who initially

514
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,520
helped paul in the first place became

515
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,000
like a communication pathway and paul

516
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,679
was able to kind of extricate himself to

517
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,240
a more full leadership role so all the

518
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,000
information was coming into xynab and

519
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
she was unable to filter and give paul

520
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,480
the pertinent staff not absolutely

521
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,000
everything going on and he could get

522
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,880
that extra space to think about things

523
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,039
and once they did that things started to

524
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,640
move a lot faster on their end this

525
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,320
would be a lot more controlled a lot

526
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,200
more

527
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,799
getting a lot more done than they were

528
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,840
before when everyone's running in

529
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,480
different directions

530
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,960
uh uh spy the double agent i talked

531
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,640
about before people were very curious

532
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,559
why he wasn't being very helpful

533
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,160
they realized what was up because at

534
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,600
this point we had told them it was a

535
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,480
drill

536
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,039
um to treat it realistically and also it

537
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,880
was now a competition between me and

538
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,120
will on the red team and the blue team

539
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,960
so if anything this maybe made them work

540
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
harder but we wanted the stress levels

541
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,480
in the adrenaline just to drop off a

542
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,160
little bit so he did tell them it was a

543
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,640
drill but treat as if it's real and you

544
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,919
know naturally they keep the double

545
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,200
agent out and he came and just sat next

546
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,799
to us and grabbed a coffee and had a lot

547
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,799
of fun watching

548
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,120
seven minutes out after that i managed

549
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,720
to find github credentials and i broke

550
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,480
out of edus because someone had missed

551
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,320
stored their greater credentials badly

552
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
cool all right now you know from this

553
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,240
initial red team aws point we've

554
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
actually broken out into other systems

555
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,559
and this is kind of the problem right

556
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,840
like secrets and credentials get

557
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,360
everywhere people need to know how to

558
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,679
store them properly

559
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,280
and this always brings me back to one of

560
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,960
the core components of a res which is

561
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,720
kms or kms on azure or kms on gcp kms on

562
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,480
whatever cloud you want

563
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,840
a fundamental

564
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,280
understanding of the key management

565
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,840
service is absolutely critical for

566
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,360
absolutely everyone that does anything

567
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,559
in that cloud

568
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,000
it's something that a lot of people shy

569
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,120
away from and they do badly because it

570
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,160
works

571
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,760
even if you do it badly like you're

572
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,120
still able to kind of move forward on

573
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,360
your future delivery but from a security

574
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,799
perspective you just end up leaving

575
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,799
stuff kind of open to the world normally

576
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,960
it's i'm in the account i can get to

577
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,039
anything kms or no kms because people

578
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,120
haven't said the keys properly so if you

579
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,039
have one kind of target area in any of

580
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,960
the clouds to go after to upskill from a

581
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,559
security perspective

582
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,679
im and kms the two kind of constants

583
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,200
across all the clouds

584
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,640
though that's where you want to target

585
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,039
okay 10.50

586
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,039
also on the western front

587
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,960
they eventually realized that talking on

588
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
the public slack which had the red team

589
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,480
in it was probably not effective for

590
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,760
them being able to actually counter

591
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,840
actors so naturally they went to google

592
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,039
hangouts

593
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,720
and made we couldn't see what they were

594
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,160
talking about anymore they got rid of

595
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,840
the double agent and they went off slack

596
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,799
we didn't know what they were doing

597
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,559
anymore

598
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,160
naturally at that point we went and

599
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,720
threw the cto and co back in and go hey

600
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
guys you need to go back in and help

601
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,440
them but also rebuild that communication

602
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,520
line again to get kind of the right

603
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,840
levels of communication going back and

604
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
forth

605
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,440
three minutes after that they thought

606
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,200
they had us contained uh they didn't

607
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
it took them almost 20 minutes to

608
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,640
realize they didn't actually have us

609
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,240
contained and will and i were getting a

610
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
little bit more audacious

611
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
in what we were building

612
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,520
five minutes after that we sent them all

613
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,440
a photo of us doing things which i can't

614
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,600
put on public slides

615
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,360
with our fingers

616
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,280
up to them just to kind of have some fun

617
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,480
with it all

618
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,320
and eight minutes after that they

619
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,039
managed to containers

620
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,960
22 minutes after that

621
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,640
will and i stepped back into the room

622
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,320
and got flipped off by everyone in the

623
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,880
room um which is quite a feeling just

624
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,400
walk into a room of people you've worked

625
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
with in the drenches with for a couple

626
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,240
years and just have them turn around and

627
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,080
go i hate you now you know it's quite

628
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,840
fun if you haven't done it i do highly

629
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,679
recommend it

630
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,520
and then ten minutes after that we moved

631
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
from contain like we had those contains

632
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,280
now it was remediation and we had set a

633
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,039
boundary on time if it got to one

634
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,360
o'clock and we hadn't been contained we

635
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,400
were just going to stop and move to

636
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,480
remediation anyway but they did manage

637
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,919
to contain this in time but still always

638
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,080
having those kind of lines in the sand

639
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
drawn so you don't take it too far and

640
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,320
because part of it is

641
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,840
getting the learning bit and everything

642
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,600
else you don't learn from experience you

643
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,840
learn by reflecting on experience so

644
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,200
it's making sure we had enough time to

645
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,640
reflect on everything going on

646
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
a big part of

647
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,120
the ethos of that company was kaizen

648
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,039
change food continuous learning that's

649
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,640
continuous improvement that's really how

650
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,799
we tried to live and move forward and

651
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,320
that was really important for us with

652
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,600
this

653
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,280
so let's kind of step back to those

654
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,360
measurements we talked about before time

655
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
to identify

656
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,080
eagle people with good memories right

657
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,640
remember was 12 minutes

658
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,760
the time to contain was one hour and 28

659
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,039
minutes

660
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,200
and the percentage of intrusion detected

661
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
ended up being about 66 percent

662
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,000
again i have no idea whether these

663
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,440
numbers are good or not i have no idea

664
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,320
if you did this at 10 different

665
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,919
consultants whether you get better or

666
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,520
worse than that or whatever it's really

667
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,679
not the point the point is about going

668
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,280
internally and looking how you can

669
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,880
improve it's not about measuring

670
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,000
yourself to everyone else in the

671
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,919
industry it's about how can we be better

672
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,360
tomorrow than we are today

673
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,039
one of the questions i got which i found

674
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,240
really interesting is someone asked if

675
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,559
it was realistic what we did

676
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,720
effectively all we did

677
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,360
we didn't do anything more than a um

678
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,880
someone who got fired and still had

679
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,000
access or was anti you know it was just

680
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,240
one set of address credentials was

681
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,840
enough to do all of this

682
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,280
and we set everything up and did all

683
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,400
that kind of stuff it was just one

684
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,880
compromise of one identity was enough to

685
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
do all of this it was interesting

686
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,720
because we tried to keep it realistic

687
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,320
and people still asked us whether it was

688
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,400
it's like no no no no it really was that

689
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,000
was a key thing we're trying to do not

690
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,360
do something like

691
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,720
completely out there that would never

692
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
happen in reality no no this could very

693
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,640
easily happen tomorrow

694
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,559
like even with mfa and everything else

695
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,039
and still one one

696
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,120
employee gone rogue and this can happen

697
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,880
one of the things i always think about

698
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,000
is backups never fail restores do like

699
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,520
just because you have a process or you

700
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,720
have stuff

701
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,360
defined you need to test these things

702
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
you need to make sure that you actually

703
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
go through the motion and that was with

704
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,039
the instant response process

705
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,960
people need to go through it to remember

706
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,480
it you can't just expect them to read it

707
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,880
and have it sink in right doesn't work i

708
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,320
think we all know it doesn't work if we

709
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,120
still do it anyway

710
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,640
um

711
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,559
one that i i swear i am coming close to

712
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,760
the end there's only a couple of minutes

713
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,520
left and i will try to end on time might

714
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,120
go one minute over

715
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,120
one thing that we noticed from this one

716
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,440
big learning from me was going back to

717
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,880
john boyd and the ooda loop which i

718
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,320
think a lot of people in security have

719
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,360
heard about

720
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,400
outside security a little bit left so

721
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,240
john boyd was a fighter pilot known as

722
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,480
42nd boyd because he could beat anyone

723
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,360
in a

724
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,640
dogfight in 40 seconds effectively

725
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,000
and he had it all based around this

726
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,240
particular ooda loop which he

727
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,039
called

728
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,279
which he coined the term for

729
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,360
and the idea is you can observe orient

730
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
decide and act and if you can go through

731
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,520
this loop faster than your opponent or

732
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,039
your competition

733
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,600
you should be able to out maneuver them

734
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,799
and win

735
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,960
effectively

736
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,720
where this kind of ties back into this

737
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
is the fundamental problem the blue team

738
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,320
had or in my opinion what the blue team

739
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,120
had

740
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,240
was it took them so long to observe and

741
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,400
figure out what was going on they could

742
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,000
never really hope to catch the red team

743
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,520
in what we were doing there was a

744
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,919
massive gap in observability in terms of

745
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,600
being able to see the estate see what

746
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,799
was happening the change that was

747
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,640
happening and everything else

748
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
and really the end of the day we it was

749
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,240
a lack of tooling they didn't have the

750
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,600
right tools on the ground to be able to

751
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,039
interact this and this was fantastic

752
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,600
learning for us okay we need to go

753
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
investigate something we need to go and

754
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,880
find something to move forward we

755
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,120
identify the gap again not a problem

756
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,960
that there's a gap it's a problem if we

757
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,480
identify the gap and we don't fix it

758
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,159
you know we captured all the

759
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,840
improvements everything any idea that

760
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,880
anyone came through throughout the

761
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
entire day were captured they were put

762
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,640
on a giant jira backlog and then there's

763
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,240
a consultancy anyone that ended up on

764
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,080
bench not on an engagement they just

765
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,840
pulled away at this backlog

766
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,360
over time and it was just like a

767
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,279
consistent rite of passage you join the

768
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,200
company here's a security backlog work

769
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,279
against this

770
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,120
or if you're between engagements cool

771
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,559
like here's some security tasks to be

772
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,720
getting on with

773
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,080
like it became a beginning of a

774
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,279
tradition from this we ran both internal

775
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,279
and public ctfs

776
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,480
this kind of story is still talked about

777
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,400
at the company with frightening

778
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,799
regularity every time we do a team day

779
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,840
and everyone's pulled together on site

780
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,600
no when i was still at the company no

781
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,960
one trusted me anymore and everyone

782
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,320
would look at me suspiciously from that

783
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
day on every time we're all off site

784
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,760
because everyone was always like maybe

785
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,240
they'll do it again and we you know they

786
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,840
will do it again and i've done other

787
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,440
companies now as well and it's just

788
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,840
really

789
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,679
effective i'll just finish off very

790
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,720
quickly on why red team why investor

791
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,919
time and the money and everything else

792
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,679
why go get the buy-in from the c-suite

793
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,919
to go and do this

794
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,799
and fundamentally i come back to chess

795
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,720
on this which may be a little bit boring

796
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
to some people but i really like this

797
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,200
concept

798
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,880
the difference between a novice and a

799
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,919
master in chess is a novice sees all the

800
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,840
pieces of individual pieces and that's

801
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,520
the way they look at the board

802
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,360
a master looks at the board and sees

803
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,120
groupings and patterns and things

804
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,400
they've seen before they have that

805
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,039
experience internalized they see a very

806
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,679
different board to a novice

807
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,679
and really when the trips are down when

808
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,919
a security incident happens

809
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,080
would you rather have masters alongside

810
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,480
you or novices

811
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,400
and the choice is yours

812
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,799
with this do this you may have some

813
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,640
masters don't do this you're going to be

814
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,960
surrounded by well intentions but

815
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,159
novices

816
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,919
and you're going to have a lot more

817
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,600
problems because of that

818
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,439
that's that's it guys thank you

819
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,480
that was an incredible presentation

820
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,000
i was kind of you know picturing on

821
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
myself being ideal you entering that

822
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
room so

823
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,080
that moment you know

824
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
like that it might be going on my like

825
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
gravestone when i die it's just like

826
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
some like artist rendition of that

827
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,159
because it was it was truly like yeah an

828
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,799
amazing time

829
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,320
so i don't think there are any any

830
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
questions you know for you but i got one

831
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,000
if you if you like me so

832
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,960
the

833
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,360
if you could pick up you know just a

834
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,000
single key takeaway or learning you know

835
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,840
from your exercise that you could

836
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,200
recommend the companies you know to

837
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,799
invest the time and effort you know what

838
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,760
would be you know the key takeaway

839
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,120
i think

840
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,520
i think for me one of the key takeaways

841
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,360
is

842
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,559
um culture is made through action

843
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,840
not words

844
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
if you invest in these kind of

845
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,919
activities and do these kind of things

846
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,919
you make you like kind of build into the

847
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,760
culture of the company that security is

848
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
really important it's something everyone

849
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,520
has to do and it's something we actively

850
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,919
invest in it's not a bolt-on at the end

851
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,919
but these kind of things like the

852
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,279
average security company of everyone in

853
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,520
that company after six months after this

854
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,600
was three to five times higher than it

855
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,200
was before we started this because we

856
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,840
made it obvious it was important to the

857
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,799
company and that kind of stuff and it

858
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,919
became part of the culture so i think

859
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,679
that's the thing like

860
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,799
even if you're not in the cloud or

861
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,320
whatever these kind of scenarios they

862
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,919
just make it important and make people

863
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,120
realize how important it is

864
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,159
follow do you have any anything

865
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,360
yeah i i wanted to ask like you did this

866
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,200
this red team

867
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
like being you part of the team have you

868
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,120
tried like

869
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,039
with like external one and being like on

870
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,039
the other side in the sense like you

871
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,039
have like probably a lot of internal

872
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,080
insight that another red team don't

873
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,240
don't have like you do you compare the

874
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,520
experience

875
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,440
yeah no normally we normally do it with

876
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,760
the ideas that any any act will have

877
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,440
done their research and done their own

878
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,880
and that kind of stuff we expect the red

879
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,159
team to be able to target very

880
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,840
specifically to whatever you've got

881
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,200
internally and that kind of stuff i

882
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,039
think it works better that way

883
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,960
um that you do want that kind of

884
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,480
intelligence of what's around there

885
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,559
because it allows you to be smarter

886
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,080
about what you're doing and also if

887
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,200
you're

888
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,520
talking state actors or you know some of

889
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,960
the real threats that exist for certain

890
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,120
businesses they are going to do that

891
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,640
it's not just script kiddies downloading

892
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,919
stuff off the dart web and running it

893
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,600
really i mean those exist as well right

894
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,399
but

895
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,679
when you're thinking about this you

896
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,200
should be playing under the expectation

897
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,559
that they know just as much as you do

898
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,159
with your architecture

899
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,279
um

900
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,799
so no i've i've been fortunate to always

901
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,120
be red team centric in this i think i do

902
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,799
okay in the blue team side but normally

903
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,399
i'm i'm

904
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,840
i think i have the mindset and people

905
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,880
see that

906
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,320
like

907
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,919
i could i don't want to say cruel but

908
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,760
like i could i take quite a bit of

909
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,960
pleasure out of doing this on the red

910
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,240
team side

911
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,159
so they're not like i will get you to do

912
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,000
it because you'll do it right but you

913
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,679
know i think and you know running the

914
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,279
red team and getting that kind of gap i

915
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,640
talked about but you're not pushing too

916
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
hard and you let people catch up and

917
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,760
feel like they're you know they're

918
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,039
making progress and all that kind of

919
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,640
stuff that takes a bit of

920
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,240
nuance and a bit of experience to try

921
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
and get right um because sometimes you

922
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,559
just get people to go way too far and or

923
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,919
you know not far enough and everything

924
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,200
else and just constantly keeping that

925
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,120
competition level there's important as

926
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,200
well

927
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,679
yeah so you have like actual you know

928
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,159
the people so you can better measure

929
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,039
this level of pressure i guess yeah yeah

930
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,799
yeah yeah the more you know the better i

931
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,799
think the better job you can you can do

932
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,760
right and yeah you want to know people

933
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,720
you want to make sure you're not pushing

934
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,640
people too hard and depending on the

935
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,760
culture of the company and stuff like

936
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,880
that the amount you can push and

937
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,480
everything else kind of changes and all

938
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,320
that kind of stuff the more you know the

939
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,520
better an experience because again you

940
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,279
want it to be positive for everyone

941
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,399
involved

942
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,279
um

943
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,799
because that's how it becomes something

944
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,480
that kind of takes on a life of its own

945
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,000
if people have negative

946
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,840
cons people have negative experiences of

947
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,760
it then it starts to die quite quickly

948
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,320
yeah yes so we really enjoyed your

949
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,679
