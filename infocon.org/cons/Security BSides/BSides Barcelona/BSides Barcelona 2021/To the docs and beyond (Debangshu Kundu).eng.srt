00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,759
okay so hello everyone and welcome to my

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,720
talk titled do the dogs i'm gone this

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,800
talk is about exploring usually

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,840
unexplored act of faith vectors

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,160
little bit about me uh who am i i'm a

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,080
hacker a country hunter

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,160
documentation reader i am also a

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,400
two-time vp and one of the top 50

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,279
hackers on background

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,039
okay so let's go over the summary of

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,519
this talk this talk comprises of four

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,400
issues

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,159
first is a cross right crypting issue

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,000
that was a story of fat prevention

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
filters and blacklist

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,399
second is a story of black security

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,440
misconfigurations for pii and more

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,320
absurd is about burning or hacking amps

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,760
with use with the help of query builder

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,079
and final one is a classic low profile

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,600
inclusion with

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,760
a footprint

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,640
so

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,199
what is documentation you may ask

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,680
um documentation um going by the

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,280
dictionary of definition of

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,920
documentation documentation is any

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,920
communicable material that is either

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
used to describe plain or instruct

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,439
regarding some other

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,119
object system or procedure such as parts

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,040
assembly installation maintenance

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,759
solution okay so with that with that out

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,040
of the way

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,280
um let's take a look at who uses talks

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,400
any

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,520
okay so there are a few big names to it

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,159
first there is adobe or em and there's

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,280
uber google cloud shopify canva

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,400
etc

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,280
so

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,200
we should reframe that question and it

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,640
should be more like

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,079
who doesn't

45
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,799
simple search of the term developer talk

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,079
on google brings up about 444 million

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,479
results

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,079
okay so

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,799
why documentation or what's the need

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,119
well talks coming out shifting tight but

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,320
the core concept of it remains the same

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,719
first off it helps the readers behave

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,360
developers or the end user to understand

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,320
how a piece of code actually works

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,119
second say plate of solid reference to

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,280
look back up later

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640
third is it provides constant updates on

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,000
new features and pieces and final one on

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the most important one is community

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,400
discussion proposed that provide new

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,800
insight into a pre-existing picture or

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,640
maybe some updates about

63
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,560
coming on

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,800
okay so let's go over the first bug of

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,080
the stock

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,519
um

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,519
here we go so it's hacking on this

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,040
product based company or software as a

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,360
service company

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
um so had a really standard

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,000
documentation as most of sas companies

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,519
would have so going over why uh this

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,760
documentation

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,280
what did i find

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,640
with the feature to build terrible paint

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,319
that's what you see is what you're

77
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,360
getting

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,720
now this is somewhat uh that what you

79
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
once you see is what you get look it

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,080
looks like you can

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,640
format the in that conformat like

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,200
italicize it you can get fold or you can

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,840
even add an image to it

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
and

85
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,680
most interestingly you can also view the

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,800
source code for the html source for it

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,640
okay now let's see let's see what the

88
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,959
documentation happens to say about you

89
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,440
it says standard html tags are generally

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,480
supported but for security reasons

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,879
following html tags and javascript

92
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,879
events not permit

93
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,640
well this seems like a black list

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
okay so what next

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,239
it is about concerning development

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,200
practice

97
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,959
really questionable

98
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,599
now what our blacklist you may have

99
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,519
we are actually

100
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,239
entity list or list of items that that

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
are to be prevented accessed

102
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,080
now what's the problem with blacklist

103
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,599
you may ask

104
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,159
there is that at least one other entity

105
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,040
be left out and in our case they were

106
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,239
quite dirty

107
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,480
okay so going over to the documentation

108
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,519
again we have restricted html tags uh to

109
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,280
be scripted of input button and sdg

110
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,080
but what about anchor or what about i

111
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,920
frame tag and other tags

112
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,880
okay

113
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,440
and they have also restricted new

114
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,759
javascript and most of all javascript

115
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,080
have been reported that begin with an on

116
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,520
that is on click on load on chat etc

117
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,199
cool but

118
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,919
maybe they forgot about using javascript

119
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,720
adding javascript uris to the blacklist

120
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,520
cool

121
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,199
so now that we are armed with this

122
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,280
information let's get hacking time to

123
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,800
build a payload

124
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,360
okay so we start out with uh the most

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,720
basic of test that is a blank anchor tag

126
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,080
this is the test

127
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,759
and then we

128
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,000
proceed to you know add again we should

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
have attribute then contact this

130
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,840
extravagance.com

131
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,639
uri that is invalid okay so it passes

132
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,840
the test and next we try actually and

133
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,919
cute from javascript that is bloodball

134
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,560
obviously the web for the filter locks

135
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,600
it

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,880
cool so after a bit of a passing

137
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
i come across

138
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,720
that is the same kind of the same but

139
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,680
just a little different it is ah equals

140
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,960
to javascript

141
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
documented domain

142
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,080
um

143
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,800
just

144
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
uh sp in place of the letter c we have

145
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,960
99

146
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,720
so what is this you may have

147
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,919
um enter html entity

148
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,479
uh so what are html

149
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,639
it is a method to display reserved html

150
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,440
guide

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,840
greater than or less than but you can

152
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,360
also

153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,000
convert the normal letters like a b c d

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,960
f to h terminal so the corresponding

155
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,039
html entity for

156
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,960
hashtag 99 uh that we call

157
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,840
that

158
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,120
is 1099 simple

159
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,440
then the app are then passed into the

160
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,520
word javascript that's bypassing the

161
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,560
filters and triggering a classic alert

162
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,639
here we have stored active interaction

163
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,759
so

164
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,800
that is done we will move on to our

165
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
second part of this talk um

166
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,840
it was yet another product based company

167
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,000
or software at the telephone company

168
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,520
you can say that

169
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,800
um they had a kind of webinar to

170
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
interact with potential customers and

171
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,560
introduce them

172
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,360
to their products or their stuff uh okay

173
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,000
so once you sign up for that webinar you

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,840
would get an automated slack input

175
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,479
so what could possibly go wrong yes with

176
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,759
configuration

177
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,680
so what are these configurations you may

178
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,240
have they are incorrect configuration of

179
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
system that lead to security issues or

180
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,759
security war rebellions

181
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
so if i were to define euphoria or a

182
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,280
moment of stream or sheer joy and

183
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,840
happiness as a hacker this would be my

184
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,520
hands

185
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,080
acted at food.io had invited you to join

186
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
their workspace crew as a kid

187
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
sadly i had guest access to one channel

188
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
only that was returned for the demo but

189
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,720
who cares

190
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,039
okay moving on

191
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,199
contrary to what one might think

192
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,400
slack isn't secure by default once it's

193
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,039
misconfigured allowing any or all

194
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,280
members of the channel to restrict or

195
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,680
allow posting in the channel

196
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
here is a snippet of slack official

197
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,840
documentation explaining a bit about it

198
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,039
that

199
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,039
all members by default

200
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,199
can use this feature but workspace

201
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,919
admins or owners can set different

202
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,039
permission what do i mean by that

203
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,000
it is that any uh any band of person in

204
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,720
this invited channel could restrict

205
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
posting for all of uh the rest there is

206
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,199
people that are present in the channel

207
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,479
and maybe not even allow threads

208
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,479
okay so this clearly highlights the

209
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,960
necessity of focusing on granular access

210
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,958
controls in an organization

211
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,640
but wait there's more by simply querying

212
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,360
plaque rest api one could easily dump

213
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,919
names emails phone numbers and some

214
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,240
people addresses to bi to be such

215
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,279
so steps to reproducing this for as far

216
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,880
as folks

217
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,200
firstly you need to make a post request

218
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,920
to slash uh select the default rest api

219
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,080
that is slash api

220
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,320
users.list

221
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,800
and then you would get a json response

222
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,680
that contains the results something like

223
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,839
this

224
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,160
now it was required to quite a big json

225
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,279
file around 7.7 megabytes and it

226
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,320
contained 10 of pii

227
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,959
so how do we make 10th of this a huge

228
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,720
chunk of data

229
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,480
thankfully thank you comes just their

230
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
cup to the same let's say to linux page

231
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,360
2

232
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
and big thanks to my friend and

233
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
dominator nike for helping out with the

234
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,000
regions

235
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,480
so we do this that we

236
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,560
save the even uh json data in a data

237
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,160
file and click it out and then pass it

238
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,959
to take you with a pipe and use the

239
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,000
custom that are flag to occupy custom

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,600
detects that

241
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,080
beautifies the list of email names and

242
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,040
phone numbers that we have

243
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,600
so with this

244
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,240
speed command we were able to filter

245
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,880
more than 3.5 000 unique countries

246
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,000
that were

247
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
of the members that represented the

248
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,760
slack channel

249
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,160
it's a bit of a proper concept for

250
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,279
those who are impressed

251
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
they also at this picks to that uh also

252
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,120
from slack official documentation said

253
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,519
by default must uh email addresses are

254
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,600
displayed in slack profile

255
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,839
but who knows that admins access

256
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,040
of this stock

257
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,160
it is

258
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,040
about uh aes or adobe experience

259
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,440
management so aerobic manager is a

260
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,640
legacy cmf that is getting used by

261
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,279
various companies across the world

262
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,760
so what is query builder

263
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,000
why does this matter

264
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,040
so

265
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,600
aem perimeter is a tool of framework

266
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,000
developed by adobe for writing simple

267
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
and efficient very easy aem it allows

268
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,040
building gtx path queries for both very

269
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,560
simple

270
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,880
so a query can be defined as a simple

271
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,760
set of predicates evaluated

272
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,600
and fairly builder does copy different

273
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,240
types of slider like when slash query

274
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,839
builder.json

275
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,800
slash elevator tortoise dot servlet feed

276
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,839
and feed dot served

277
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,959
okay what now let's start by debugging

278
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,800
normal query builder

279
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,200
first up is the domain that is psi.com

280
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,519
followed by the path to variable the api

281
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,320
that is open squarebill.json and

282
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,399
followed by the queries or the stuff

283
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,320
that you want to fill

284
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,639
but um real world

285
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,000
stencil looks somewhat like this

286
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
there is a domain followed by the

287
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,440
password variable api and the stuff for

288
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,360
next film and

289
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,519
uh multiple splash sheets have white

290
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,920
listed extension in order to bypass

291
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,880
satisfactory configurations

292
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,279
after this one we have appended a

293
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,079
uh widely possibly widely detention like

294
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,120
css and multiple flashes

295
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,639
okay so

296
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,000
let's take a bit of a detour

297
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
what is dispatcher

298
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,920
well dispatcher is am or adop experience

299
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,720
managers caching on or load balancing

300
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
tool that can be used in conjunction

301
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,600
with a

302
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,040
enterprise cloud web server this is how

303
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,920
in

304
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,639
the vm environment looks like there's a

305
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,120
author intent with replicate to public

306
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,519
constant there which is then passed on

307
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,160
to the dispatcher and then finally to

308
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,000
the general well am prior to murray lee

309
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,880
lies on dispatches or dispatchers

310
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,200
dispatched on any quality to function as

311
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,920
an allow or denied it if certain paths

312
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,680
are to be allowed tensions are to be

313
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,839
allowed or this uh things are going out

314
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,480
that these are denied so an allow rules

315
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,560
look somewhat like this like the given

316
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,320
allow rule um

317
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,959
allows access to any or all folders that

318
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,720
are under the folders and files

319
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,440
underneath or directly and this is the

320
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,800
denial

321
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,680
um this would deny any get request to

322
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,480
the

323
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,800
given point that is selected

324
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,920
here

325
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,320
i guess now it's clear that what role

326
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
the multiple slideshares had allowed

327
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,959
extensions that did not chip dot png dot

328
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,839
css that are added somewhere on here

329
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,920
planes

330
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
okay so

331
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
back to query builder time to talk about

332
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,839
the actual stuff

333
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,560
that would help you in uh

334
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,760
coverability and think of a content

335
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,560
so here's the positive variable the kpi

336
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,160
and followed by the stuff that you want

337
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,000
to implement

338
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
okay so it's time to talk about the

339
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,839
query parameters

340
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,600
so that you can build queries normally

341
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,920
and no longer rely on tool output

342
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,360
yes

343
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,000
well first up is type equals to entities

344
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,160
profile this display

345
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,680
list of files that are contained with

346
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,959
application next is type equals these

347
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,360
two folder which displays folders that

348
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,160
are the application and typically

349
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,279
page with free capital that is used for

350
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,399
pages

351
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,199
next is full texting string this would

352
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,639
scrape the entire application for any or

353
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,160
occurrences of the given input string

354
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,560
well next is node name equals to star

355
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,920
dot extension

356
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,320
you can specify the delta to be anything

357
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
like whatsapp whatsapp.txt

358
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,360
and jar and store

359
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,440
next is path

360
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,279
hook this query from the given operation

361
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,800
within a specified part like slash home

362
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,040
slash

363
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,000
okay next is p dot limit equals to minus

364
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,399
10. suppose you want to specify a limit

365
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,839
to the number of results you want to

366
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,639
keep like 10 or 20. so notice that p

367
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,279
naught limit goes to 10 or 20 something

368
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,639
like that or maybe you want to dump all

369
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,600
the

370
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,720
resultant uh you know files or folders

371
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,199
you will go simply p dot limit equals to

372
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,160
minus one to extract all that

373
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,800
okay so maybe you want to find recently

374
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,360
modified items you would go order by

375
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,839
equals to add the rate tpr to content

376
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,639
flat

377
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,959
who is the large class modified this

378
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,880
would uh bring about the recently

379
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,959
modified uh items or the items that have

380
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,000
maybe dev has touched up on recent

381
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,639
okay let's talk about property and

382
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,320
property dot value

383
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,199
so

384
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,440
i'm going to give two examples of it in

385
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,560
this stock

386
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,959
first is property consultation created

387
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,800
by and property dot value equals to

388
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,959
admin this would bring about all the

389
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,800
files or folders that have been created

390
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,120
by the admin user you can specify this

391
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,160
to be uh some uh like author or any of

392
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,240
the user that you may find

393
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,040
cool

394
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,279
so next is property goes to create

395
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,240
rightlook operator values posts so this

396
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,600
would bring about all the files or

397
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,920
folders that have secret their title

398
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,720
name you can specify this to be anything

399
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,759
else like

400
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,480
password or something like that

401
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,240
okay so maybe you want to turn on

402
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,160
multiple parts

403
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,519
for group or dot one the score

404
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
parameter that's path

405
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,560
uh

406
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,079
so you go group dot one and let's go

407
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,800
party first

408
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
so this given very would uh confine your

409
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,399
opposition area of operator into

410
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,079
two folders that is slash app that's

411
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,560
like one

412
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,160
so time to

413
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,720
see some stuff in action

414
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,640
okay it's the full text query that i

415
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,880
talked about

416
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,319
it is for full text equals to admin

417
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,119
yeah

418
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,679
um as you can see each one of the listed

419
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,319
items have am somewhere in their body or

420
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,039
title or something they to have a

421
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,439
message

422
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,079
next is a full textbook called secret

423
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,400
and full text equal to

424
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,960
all the listed items have password

425
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,039
somewhere title or name or

426
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,799
next is the this way this apparently

427
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,799
all the active files in the given

428
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,160
application

429
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,559
so let's break it down first is type

430
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,640
equals to at least two pi for fetching

431
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,160
files under the path that is called

432
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,039
sd and roll depth equals to start.txt

433
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,200
okay and p dot limit equals to minus one

434
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,840
to fetch all the resulted apps

435
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,960
phase

436
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,360
results

437
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,520
next is the for

438
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
similar just

439
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,280
we have changed the extension to be dot

440
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,000
html here

441
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,640
the list of html

442
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,840
uh

443
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,960
compared to txt files here

444
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,840
very useful uh

445
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,960
okay so

446
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,440
um combining queries for better results

447
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,600
please take it to the grain of salt and

448
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,840
it won't always work depending upon the

449
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,679
dispatch configurations that you

450
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,440
encounter in the file

451
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,039
so

452
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,120
um this is two queries

453
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,840
first one and

454
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,679
second uh first one searches for all the

455
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,799
txt files that are that is directory and

456
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,720
the second one searches for

457
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,320
um all the

458
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,160
html files under the

459
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,080
suppose you're gonna combine that into a

460
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,520
single query but we do we go simply

461
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,039
that's because that is two five we don't

462
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,440
need to change that but so we don't need

463
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,960
to get that and

464
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,080
we group this together group dot one

465
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,480
the query that is node name because star

466
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,960
dot x

467
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
that's it

468
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
well everything that i talked about

469
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,600
talked about is well documented in

470
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,520
adobe's official documentation at

471
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,520
experiencelink.org.com

472
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,880
okay so

473
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,640
the one of the final ones of this stock

474
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,880
factory school apparently it is

475
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,280
this is a classic local file heat or

476
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,600
right vulnerability with some other good

477
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,840
stuff

478
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,080
okay so let's go over the workflow of

479
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,799
this talk because uh hacking on a

480
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,720
widespread program a white spoke program

481
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,760
means that

482
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,080
any of all the domains that you control

483
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,679
are in scope

484
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,679
so i went over to strodan what you

485
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,679
showed that it's the search engine that

486
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,000
many of us have to choose to find a

487
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,880
specific technology or find uh spread

488
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,520
into the hosts that are confined to a

489
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,679
given certificate or a domain

490
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,080
so i use the talk of filter that is

491
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,240
simply to target this searches for or

492
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,039
that is called ssl uh certificates for

493
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,760
the given tag specified to be google for

494
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,080
facebook uh this would search up all the

495
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,320
certificates belong to please get google

496
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,080
and list all that

497
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,960
so

498
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,320
assuming the target to be targets

499
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,280
um

500
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,880
uh inputting this uh i found an id point

501
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,600
into top.

502
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,320
um upon visiting i find a

503
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,799
developer admin panel which was known

504
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,320
for uh many of its functions

505
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,200
well so instinctively i went over to

506
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,600
the application.js file that was in the

507
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,720
source code

508
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,440
and upon scraping that file i found it

509
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,640
relative path that is tms the api plus

510
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,240
scripts pipe and particles hubba

511
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,480
well uh upon seeing a path parameter

512
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,320
what a hacker would

513
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,799
try doing instinctively is a

514
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,400
part reversal and

515
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,480
ultimately a local five pollutant he did

516
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,600
the same

517
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,600
that is simple local file inclusion fail

518
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,760
dot

519
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,120
path

520
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,360
type the file that i want to build the

521
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,400
password

522
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,320
command use for moving look finders

523
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,760
[Music]

524
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,360
on this note i would like to put a

525
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,080
reservoir who said live love and logo by

526
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,790
inclusion

527
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,240
[Music]

528
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,880
okay i didn't stop on it then the theme

529
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,200
is directly here this uh steamed a

530
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,919
little bit uh you know out of the box

531
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,159
so i went over to my directory booklet

532
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,039
for simple that is

533
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,080
responses so i wanted only 200 responses

534
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,159
and i did get a single uh 200 open spot

535
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,880
was it ui page or swaggy by dot

536
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,760
that are available on your website in

537
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
the ui or graphical user interface

538
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,320
format it renders all the api calls

539
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,480
generated from your generated from your

540
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,400
open api spec with visual lock update

541
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,640
so which makes it easy for a that is

542
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,039
back and implementation and we get use

543
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,799
the wrong question this is what you will

544
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,360
mostly encounter in the world but

545
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,679
please do take note that and suppose

546
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,240
swagger ui

547
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,159
security one

548
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,840
okay so every function uh swagger ui

549
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,480
and api calls that are assigned to

550
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,799
different http methods that are used to

551
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,480
perform different

552
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,760
they get required with some who detected

553
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,000
slash directed by the some data and also

554
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,080
requests for the same

555
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,039
data and delete request to delete the

556
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,679
uploaded data well it also shows the

557
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,240
name description parameters required in

558
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,280
the api call additionally it also holds

559
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,080
the resulting responses after the api

560
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,159
call has happened whether it was a 200

561
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,120
okay or 401 403 for the phone that

562
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,480
okay so

563
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,200
let's talk numbers a bit here

564
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,919
um there are about twenty eight thousand

565
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,000
two hundred and six public swagger by

566
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,320
intensity as well

567
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,840
as at the moment of uh preparing system

568
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,159
so let's get back to power talk

569
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,520
topic

570
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,320
um this was the swagger ui that i

571
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,760
encountered in a while

572
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,320
the first five operations being uh

573
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,640
and the sixth operation was the most

574
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,400
useful

575
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,440
let's take a crusher

576
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
this is what i would call

577
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,000
perfect definition of credo get it up

578
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,520
until it

579
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,960
first one

580
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,000
the

581
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,880
the obvious

582
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,600
okay

583
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,960
and this is why you shouldn't leave such

584
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,400
api an awesome page

585
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,120
simple post request to flash tiabath

586
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,919
slash api script slash file

587
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,080
um but enough to create any file in any

588
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,440
desired folder with any content type

589
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,799
tension

590
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,799
i have for the demo i have i

591
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,240
included a pc.html file

592
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,039
and in any desired folder like flash

593
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,240
test i didn't hamper with flash

594
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,080
any other important folders because that

595
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,720
might be catastrophic production

596
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,440
and as a result the file gets created in

597
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,360
the desired folder that

598
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,240
that's

599
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,640
next uh

600
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,480
is the delete treatment

601
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,640
we specify uh

602
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,360
the paths to be practice slash dot html

603
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,480
uh pass to the uploaded file

604
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,440
okay

605
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,120
and this deletes the desired file from

606
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,080
one location file gets it

607
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,000
awesome

608
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,120
well

609
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,840
uh final one say bonus

610
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,679
fight so about

611
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,840
what

612
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,000
by

613
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,760
supplying the

614
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,159
arbitrary audition i specified my pub

615
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,600
collaboratory

616
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
base of the origin header and it

617
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,559
reflected back in the acio or to control

618
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,159
origin

619
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,360
uh with credentials

620
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,200
okay so this is a very simple exploit

621
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,880
but uh called

622
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,840
composition

623
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,279
successful exploited vulnerability would

624
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,480
lead to

625
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
disclosure of the uh authenticated

626
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,080
information pertaining to the reduce

627
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,679
good so

628
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,279
a few takeaways from this stock first in

629
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,760
blacklist aren't always good pro

630
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,840
second is focus on granular access

631
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,320
control centrifugation soil issues since

632
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,520
the human element is very error-prone

633
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,880
third is by testing any cms in all

634
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,799
public documentation to better

635
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,520
understand how it actually works

636
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,480
and the fourth one and the final one

637
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,120
never leave a sensitive apis unauthentic

638
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,520
to complete staging depth of production

639
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,360
thank you everyone for taking tuning in

640
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,480
and big thanks to besides barcelona for

641
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,720
allowing me this opportunity to present

642
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,760
my talk

643
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
and you can talk to me at this

644
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,640
historical time on twitter and um for

645
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,960
questions

646
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,120
so let's let's give a couple of minutes

647
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,880
just if people want to write some

648
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,559
questions in the meanwhile

649
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,240
uh again as i said you can write

650
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,720
questions here in zoom or uh you can

651
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,960
write them in slack and we take care of

652
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,679
them

653
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,600
uh we wait a couple of minutes just one

654
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,919
question i'm very curious i never heard

655
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,200
about the

656
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,360
uh what's called the business adult

657
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,880
business experience um

658
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,600
yeah

659
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,720
exactly

660
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,840
how common is it how many

661
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,200
instances it's very common uh like uh

662
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,360
tesla uses it

663
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,159
volkswagen uses it many other company

664
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,000
twitter users

665
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,480
oh okay okay again for me was like quite

666
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,559
it's quite interesting right and i was

667
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,679
googling at the beginning very

668
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,240
interesting yeah and i was like oh wow

669
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,000
um

670
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,960
and i was like okay it's quite

671
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
interesting let me google and see how

672
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,600
common is it because again usually you

673
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,520
can find tons of posts at the moment in

674
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,480
the wild

675
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,000
okay okay i got a big companies

676
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,200
second

677
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
a lot of big companies do

678
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,720
not know

679
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,480
okay okay i was thinking they were more

680
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,240
like sharepoint and all this type of

681
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,080
stuff so uh

682
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,399
not really sure about that so no i mean

683
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,360
we don't have any question uh so far we

684
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,399
have

nihal was just thanking you and it was

689
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,080
cool and it's like learn something about

690
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,520
where you build it again i think

691
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,200
everyone just knew something about fairy

692
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,360
view there it was uh yes it's a quite

693
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,919
famous but like people actually tend to

694
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,000
stick to the tool output and usually

695
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,919
they don't put much to pertain you know

696
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,919
building the queries manually or just

697
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,080
trying out stuff that is present in the

698
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,720
documentation so that was that's what

699
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,559
this talk was about

700
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,720
that makes sense makes sense

701
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,000
um

702
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000

703
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,559

704
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,720
okay so hold on there is a question okay

705
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,919

706
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,360
uh see for me now uh is there a score is

707
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,080
there a course misconfiguration

708
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,440
uh often exists in swagger ui

709
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,000
i mean president very common uh

710
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
it depends but it it

711
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,360
you can find

712
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,159

713
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,159
the you know

714
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,159
the people that are building it in the

715
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,159
back

716
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,640
they do specify the text that say what

717
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,840
exists but

718
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,760
if they leave it as if

719
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,080

720
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,200
