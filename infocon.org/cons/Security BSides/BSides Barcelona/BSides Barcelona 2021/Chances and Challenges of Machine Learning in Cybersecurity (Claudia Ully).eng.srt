1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,319
further ado

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,359
claudia the floor is yours

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,200
thanks for the introduction and let's

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,759
get started we have a lot of to cover

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,719
today so um as announced i will talk

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,160
about chances and the meaning of

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,640
opportunities and challenges of machine

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,480
learning in cyber security so what i'm

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,560
going to cover is that i want to give

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,320
you a basic understanding of machine

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
what machine learning is

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,400
we will learn about different types of

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,240
machine learning how they work and see

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,000
areas where machine learning is already

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,559
applied in cyber security but we also

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,719
want to discuss challenges and problems

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,800
that are related to machine learning in

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,040
cyber security so the goal is that by

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,040
the end of this talk you should have a

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,920
solid overview of how cyber security can

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,079
benefit from machine learning but also

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,920
which challenges and threats and

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,320
problems are related to it so it's more

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,760
meant like um

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,000
an introductory talk to the topic and

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,719
not a real technical deep drive but i

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,039
hope you can get

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,920
a few

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,319
things inspirations that then help you

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,200
to maybe dig deeper into this topic

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,000
so

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,320
just two sentences about me damien

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
already introduced me so i'm a

34
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
significant security consultant at in

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,640
visa where i'm mainly focusing on

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,720
penetration testing so whether mobile

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,560
application security

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,200
um but the interest in machine learning

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,920
i actually got this during my university

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,360
studies um

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,960
where i

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,920
dig

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
deeper into reinforcement especially we

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,960
will come to that in a second and i'm

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,079
now really curious to see and explore

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,960
how

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,600
i can combine kind of these two really

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,360
interesting topics machine learning and

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,600
cyber security

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,720
so first is machine learning precisely

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,520
to security at all a thing or is it just

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,720
kind of a yeah hot topic by uh

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,600
making it some propaganda or marketing

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,280
stuff so

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,439
um if you think back traditionally

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,280
security problems are aided by

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,360
mathematical models such as

58
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,200
think about cryptography

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,959
but those models have limits when it

60
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,878
comes to a very large number of

61
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,360
variables we have to consider and if we

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,319
have to process a huge amount of data

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,959
and these are areas that are actually

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,360
the strength of machine learning so this

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,400
is why it is indeed a thing we we can

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,200
use um or we should um

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,000
uh yeah cover when talking about cyber

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,640
security also because a lot of companies

69
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,720
are kind of adopting it

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,400
but the word of caution

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,920
not everywhere machine learning is

72
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,000
written on the outside it's actually on

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,040
the inside so because there are overlaps

74
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,519
between machine learning and just simple

75
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,080
statistics some vendors might claim they

76
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,319
are using machine learning when actually

77
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,800
they are just applying simple statistics

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,280
in the back so it is indeed sometimes

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,040
more kind like a

80
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,519
marketing thing or kind of thing to to

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,120
make look things

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,959
nice and shiny

83
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,440
so with this in mind first let's get our

84
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,840
terminology terminology straight so

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,680
there are terms like artificial

86
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,599
intelligence machine learning deep

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,440
learning flowing around

88
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,800
and

89
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,519
um often used interchangeably although

90
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,159
there aren't exactly the same thing so

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,000
artificial intelligence actually the

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,080
broad field and study

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,519
uh of simulating human intelligence

94
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,120
while machine learning is a subset of it

95
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,080
an approach to enable computers to make

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,480
decisions on their own and do

97
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,560
stuff and things they were not

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
explicitly programmed to do the phrase

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,040
was coined back in 1952 already by

100
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
arthur samuel a pioneer in the field of

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,000
computer gaming and artificial

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,400
intelligence so it has been longer round

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,879
than one might think but it has formerly

104
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,120
limitations due to the computational

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,920
power it requires and this is also the

106
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,720
reason why it's kind of gaining momentum

107
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
during the last decades

108
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,400
now deep learning again is just um a

109
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
subset of machine learning so it's

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,239
certain techniques applied within

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,080
machine learning

112
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,478
that is about simulating the behavior of

113
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,199
the human brain and we will come back to

114
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,759
this a bit more in detail later during

115
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,040
this talk

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,919
now

117
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,840
also machine learning is not just one

118
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,520
thing but there are actually different

119
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
types of machine learnings and all are

120
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,840
suited for different types of tasks that

121
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,360
we want to achieve

122
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,320
um we usually divide between three

123
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,759
different types of machine learning

124
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,240
supervised learning which might be the

125
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
most commonly known and can be compared

126
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,040
to learning with a teacher so you kind

127
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
of have someone or something that tells

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
you exactly what is what and

129
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,600
what to make of this things you see

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,560
and it's mainly used for prediction

131
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
so we want to map a certain input we

132
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,199
have to a certain output

133
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,199
and the most commonly known

134
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,840
sub-category here is classification

135
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,360
where the predicted output is

136
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,639
categorical so think of it in the

137
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,720
example of image recognition so we give

138
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,039
it a picture and we want to know if we

139
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,560
can see here for example a cat or a dog

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,199
if we want to predict some real valued

141
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,960
output then we are talking about

142
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,440
regression so this can be applied for

143
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,759
example for weather forecasts or market

144
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,840
forecasting

145
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,160
also in unsupervised learning we have

146
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,800
different subtypes unsupervised learning

147
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,160
can be comparable to doing self-studies

148
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,199
so

149
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,039
you don't have any

150
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,039
one telling you what to make of the

151
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,160
things you you read and study but you

152
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,720
have to kind of organize and structurize

153
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,600
it on your own and

154
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,919
so you usually use it for example for a

155
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,319
time like of pattern detection and

156
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:00,000
structuralizing data so clustering for

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,680
example um is about grouping input into

158
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,720
segments based on certain similarities

159
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
so the machine learning algorithm is to

160
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,560
kind of find those similarities and

161
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
group the data according to it

162
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,360
we have association rule learning um

163
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,319
which is about finding correlations you

164
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,919
might have always seen this for example

165
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,240
if you get proposed products in amazon

166
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,400
or if you have kind of like spotify and

167
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,720
your weekly discovery playlist or

168
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,240
something like that

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,600
and

170
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,919
it's based on the probability that we

171
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,199
see two events occurring together so

172
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,600
kind of if you like

173
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,919
song a there is a

174
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,240
eighty percent chance that you also like

175
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,600
uh song b because this has been observed

176
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,639
together um very often

177
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,360
and as a third

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
type of unsupervised learning we have

179
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,919
dimensionality reduction which is often

180
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,599
more like a

181
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,319
pre-processing or intermediate step it's

182
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,120
for filtering and reducing data so

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,000
reducing the dimension dimensionality

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
for example if we want to create

185
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,919
visualizations or if we want to process

186
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,000
the data further and

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240
i want to kind of

188
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,479
reduce it for that purpose

189
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,680
and last but not least we have

190
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,599
reinforcement learning which can be

191
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,840
compared to learning with a critic so

192
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,919
someone who doesn't tell you upfront

193
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,440
what is what and what is right and what

194
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,560
is wrong but

195
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
will give you feedback based on what you

196
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,080
did before and the what it's used for is

197
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,160
like learning procedures of actions

198
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
based on the feedback you get and we

199
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,280
will have a closer look and all those

200
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,440
three types and how they are applied and

201
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,360
or can be applied for

202
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,680
in the field of cyber security during

203
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,120
this talk but first let's see the basic

204
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,360
machine learning process you usually

205
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,599
have and it all starts with gathering

206
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,160
data because data is kind of the fuel

207
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,240
for machine learning so we need it for

208
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,800
our training process and

209
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,160
um like with fuel for a car the the

210
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,720
quality and quantity we have has a

211
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,000
direct input on the results we get so if

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
you have bad fuel in your car um

213
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,199
it might destroy it or it might get you

214
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,440
very fun the same is for data and a

215
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,919
machine learning algorithm

216
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,160
next we want to prepare the data so kind

217
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,080
of for example randomize the data

218
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,759
samples but also very important check

219
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,560
for biases so for example is there a

220
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,399
certain type of data very dominant in

221
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,958
your data set and if yes your result

222
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,599
will also be biased toward this type of

223
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,279
data and will be struggling with other

224
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,120
types of data so the very yeah kind of

225
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
famous or infamous example for that is

226
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,240
the early phases of face recognition

227
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,000
which were mainly um

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
trained on

229
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
images of white people and then of

230
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,160
course the algorithm struggled with

231
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,560
the faces of people of color

232
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,440
now

233
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,680
something else we want to do is split

234
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,560
our

235
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,120
data set into a training and evaluation

236
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,720
data set so

237
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,519
usual uh ratio here is something like 80

238
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,200
30 or 70

239
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,640
80 20 or 70 30. so you have a larger

240
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,839
training than eventuation data set but

241
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,399
we need the evaluation data set a bit

242
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,279
later as we will see in a minute

243
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,600
next we choose a model so a model is um

244
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,279
kind of the the raw material uh

245
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,399
we have it's a it's a generic program

246
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,560
that is then made specific

247
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,720
by data so think of it like clay which

248
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
will then get molded through your hands

249
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,640
by repeating the um

250
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,880
yeah

251
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,160
molding it or turning the the wheel or

252
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,760
something like that

253
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,959
so we of course have to choose here

254
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,760
which learning algorithm we want to use

255
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,959
and

256
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,040
there are of course multiple algorithms

257
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,959
out there so there's not just one for

258
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,360
classification one for clustering but

259
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,760
there are a lot of different types and

260
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,560
um

261
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,240
what you have to choose is of course the

262
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,040
right right algorithm that's suited for

263
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,720
your purpose so is it at all a

264
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,200
classification task is more a clustering

265
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,760
task and which algorithm in for this

266
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,399
task is the best or could be the best

267
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,399
for your case

268
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,519
next we start training so this is the

269
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,200
learning process that forms the model um

270
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
until we finally have the result we want

271
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,959
and it's an iterative process so we do a

272
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,200
lot of training loops but

273
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
during which we make repeatedly small

274
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,680
changes to our model until we finally

275
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,920
get the result we want

276
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,399
and to check whether we've reached the

277
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,079
state we of course need to evaluate

278
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,399
our model so we run our model on the

279
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,959
evaluation data set you remember step

280
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,600
two where this where we took this out so

281
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,640
we give it data it hasn't seen before to

282
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,440
check its performance on unknown inputs

283
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,480
and see whether it can work with that so

284
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,240
you have problems we will come back to

285
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
this later where you might have not

286
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
trained enough and it doesn't perform

287
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,800
well

288
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
on the data set or you might have

289
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,279
trained too much and then it also

290
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,000
doesn't perform well on the evaluation

291
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,079
data set

292
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,399
so based on the outcome you will start

293
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,440
tuning

294
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,800
your uh

295
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
um

296
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,760
yeah your algorithm so

297
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,079
certain parameters you use and try to

298
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,320
optimize the performance for example get

299
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,720
to create a prediction accuracy

300
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,200
and last but not least you can finally

301
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,000
apply the model this step is also called

302
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
inference so putting the machine

303
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,639
learning model into production use the

304
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,440
trained model actually to solve the task

305
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,800
um

306
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,720
you would like to solve it

307
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,519
so

308
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,639
let's look at this process um a bit more

309
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,120
in detail in the different types of

310
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,000
machine learning we've seen so at first

311
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,200
uh let's look at the supervised learning

312
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,240
and here let's choose an actual example

313
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,519
from the

314
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,920
area of cyber security a very typical

315
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,480
one like spam detection

316
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,880
so this is a classification task we want

317
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,040
to predict an output that's categorical

318
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,600
so is it spam this is not spam

319
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,519
and what we need first in the training

320
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,320
process is label data so or we at least

321
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
we need two things we need the labels

322
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
this is what we want to predict like

323
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
spam not spam

324
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,160
and we need label data so in this

325
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,040
example a lot of emails for which we

326
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
already know this is a spam email and

327
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,680
this is not a spam email

328
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,240
now we will describe each data point

329
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,079
through a feature or attribute vector so

330
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,240
this is the criteria based on which we

331
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,200
will then train our model and later make

332
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,839
our predictions so this is actually data

333
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,399
or our features that are

334
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,800
probably relevant for for our

335
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,480
classification here

336
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,920
so

337
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,839
the example of emails this could be for

338
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,399
example the sender address or contained

339
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,360
links or attachments but something like

340
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
for example the date and uh time of

341
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,480
receipt might not be a

342
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,880
feature that's really important relevant

343
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,519
for predicting if something is spam or

344
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,959
not

345
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,079
next

346
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,920
we start the training process as i said

347
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,160
it's an iterative process where the

348
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,040
learner develops models or shapes the

349
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,920
model um based on the training data

350
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
and

351
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,720
we once we we are finished the training

352
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,560
process or also in between we then

353
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,360
run some evaluation to see if we whether

354
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,560
we first have to maybe change and tune

355
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,720
some things here so what we could change

356
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,800
for example is of course some parameters

357
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,600
in the algorithm itself so in the

358
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,839
training part but also maybe make

359
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,160
changes to the feature metrics if we see

360
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
um

361
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,480
maybe a feature might uh

362
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,639
be uh add a feature that might be

363
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,639
helpful a removal feature that we don't

364
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,720
think happened this all can change the

365
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,040
outcome

366
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,519
so after completing the training process

367
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,160
then we can use it for prediction which

368
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,800
will mean we get an email

369
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,800
also we have to extract the feature edge

370
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,120
or attribute vector as we did for the

371
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,720
training data

372
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,360
and now we'll put it or we'll give it to

373
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,600
the model that we've trained and as a

374
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,399
result we get back

375
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,360
a certain probability that the mail we

376
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,000
gave it is a spam or a non-schema spam

377
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,279
email

378
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,440
and the same principle can be applied

379
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,839
for example for or is already applied

380
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,040
for malware detection um where you then

381
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,120
of course have um

382
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,519
extract features from from the ba

383
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,160
from a binary to see whether you have or

384
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
whether it's uh

385
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,560
yeah

386
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,040
a good or or bad uh

387
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,839
um

388
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,839
executable for example you're dealing

389
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,800
with

390
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,880
now for those who thought oh this is

391
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,399
really interesting i

392
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,800
want to do this myself and get my hands

393
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,199
sturdy and give it a try what you need

394
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,040
of course is some data and there are

395
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,600
data sets out there you can use for

396
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,160
example for training your own spam

397
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
detection algorithms that the spam based

398
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,199
data set from the university of

399
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,880
california irving

400
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,560
and that has about 5 500 emails of which

401
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,160
about 13

402
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,399
are spammy mess so you have the label

403
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,880
data there you can use and also for

404
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,240
malware

405
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,720
um there are data sets like microsoft's

406
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,600
malware data set or endgamers ember

407
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,759
malware properties dataset that you

408
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,639
could use if you just want to try it out

409
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,240
and try training a model on your own in

410
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,880
these tasks

411
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,160
so what does the process now look like

412
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,000
or what are the actual differences in

413
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,240
the process now for unsupervised

414
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,560
learning as we remember this was more

415
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,680
for organizing and structurizing data

416
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,959
so the first difference is that we have

417
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,440
a completely different input here

418
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,880
which is we get unlabeled data so

419
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,120
as i said we don't have something that

420
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,440
already tells us what is what we just

421
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,920
get data as it is

422
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,320
and again we must describe it through a

423
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,240
feature vector

424
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,720
and um start the training process and um

425
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,480
shape the model and

426
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,920
as a as an outcome usually then there's

427
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,240
some human intervention needed and

428
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
required to interpret the output we get

429
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,720
at the end

430
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,000
from the model

431
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,839
so uh the

432
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,199
algorithm or we will get back some type

433
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,360
of clustering for example

434
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,320
and we will then actually have to detect

435
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,199
what

436
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,919
is the points or the reason that the

437
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,400
data was clustered that way so taking

438
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,599
the example here um what we could end up

439
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,559
with is for example like on the left we

440
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,119
got two clusters based on the shape as

441
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,359
we can see and on the right we've got

442
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,799
three clusters based on the color so

443
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,520
this is why we then here need some still

444
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,960
some brain to see what what we get as a

445
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,880
result

446
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,919
now where could this be used for example

447
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,440
um two areas of applications are user

448
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,559
behavior analytics and forensic analysis

449
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,960
so in user behavior analytics what we

450
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,919
want to do is of course find anomalies

451
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,000
and user behavior and detect uh to

452
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,480
detect insider and outsider attacks so

453
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,880
parameters you usually look for are for

454
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,919
example

455
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,440
my ip addresses and their geolocations

456
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,480
time stamps user agents or certain

457
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,320
actions

458
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,600
that are done

459
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,720
and

460
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,039
if you look at it as a very simplified

461
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,760
example here you can say that the

462
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
behavior of admins

463
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,919
has some typical traits putting them

464
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,120
into one group so kind of like the blue

465
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,320
cluster you can see here and the typical

466
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,559
behavior of your users is a different

467
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,080
group it's like the yellow cluster here

468
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,559
and if now an admin for example logs in

469
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,880
from an unusual ip address one that's

470
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,960
usually associated with a normal user

471
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,640
for example he

472
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,080
moves out of uh his admin cluster so

473
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
what we can do very well with

474
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,880
unsupervised learning here is detect

475
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,480
outliers and things that do not fit

476
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,000
into or

477
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,880
do not fit into their usual cluster into

478
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
a cluster at all

479
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,120
same goes for forensic analysis so for

480
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,440
example if you try finding anomalies and

481
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,880
log files which are usually huge

482
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,240
this is really

483
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,120
of help here to process this amount of

484
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,240
data

485
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,720
and to find things that really stick out

486
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,039
and can be indicators of attacks or

487
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,440
compromise

488
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,320
so outliers could be for example data

489
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,440
that

490
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
doesn't match any other data or

491
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,120
something that's unusual in terms of

492
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,160
frequency in terms of correlation on

493
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
sequence and there are tools out there

494
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,440
that already use unsupervised learning

495
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,480
um usually with a deep learning approach

496
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,120
which i will explain in a second

497
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,240
for example splunk or dark trace are

498
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,200
tools for user behavior analysis

499
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,640
using

500
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,559
unsupervised or using machine learning

501
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,640
and supervised learning to

502
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,640
do this task or a forensic analysis

503
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,600
you have the elastic stack um which is

504
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,520
free and open source and helps you

505
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,200
actually create your own machine

506
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,360
learning jobs to analyze and monitor

507
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
metrics from blocks so we also see

508
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,840
they're kind of a

509
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,679
machine learning becoming easier

510
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,679
available to end users so you don't have

511
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,200
to really understand the deep

512
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,880
technical stuff anymore and the

513
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,520
mathematics behind it but it's kind of

514
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,000
getting more user friendly and more easy

515
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,039
to use

516
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,000
now

517
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
last but not least from the types of

518
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,720
machine learning reinforcement learning

519
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,480
which differs a little from the two

520
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,960
things we've seen now because here the

521
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,679
agent or we call it the agent so then

522
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,520
let's call it the learner the one who

523
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,159
learns is creating their own learning

524
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,080
experience through interaction with an

525
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,919
environment so we don't have data

526
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,400
beforehand and it's like learning

527
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,480
through trial and error

528
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,679
so the best example to think about is

529
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,880
about this is for example cleaning robot

530
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,520
so if you think about a cleaning robot

531
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,159
running your how around in your house

532
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,320
what it has it has certain sensors

533
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,000
attached to it um which will um yeah

534
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
give it a certain state so for example

535
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,840
with it will see

536
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,919
all my front proximity sensors detect

537
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,840
something very close to me could be

538
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,919
translated to like i'm standing in front

539
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,600
of a wall or at least in front of

540
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,799
something

541
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,880
so and based on the observation it has

542
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,840
it now tries to choose an action and it

543
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,120
has an a certain policy which is kind of

544
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,880
its current knowledge

545
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,919
that helps the agent

546
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,320
or in this case the robot to select and

547
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,960
execute an action so possible options

548
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,520
would be here for example move front or

549
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,280
turn sideways

550
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,520
and as a result of taking action we have

551
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,360
another observation

552
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,120
so for example after moving front um the

553
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,159
agent will detect all my bumpers the

554
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,440
table is

555
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,840
detected that i hit something or when it

556
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
turns sideways it will say my front

557
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,039
proximity sensor see there's nothing uh

558
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,120
in front of me anymore

559
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,159
so

560
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,960
based on the observation we put first

561
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,760
head the action we took and the new

562
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,480
state and observation we are in

563
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,880
the agent will receive a certain reward

564
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,360
uh so kind of which indicates whether

565
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,840
the action was good or bad so kind of if

566
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,760
if we bump against the wall against the

567
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,600
wall that's bad we give it a negative

568
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,520
reward meaning basically a negative

569
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,200
number usually

570
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,679
and if we detect we have now a freeway

571
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,080
um we give it a positive

572
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,880
reward so kind of a positive number to

573
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,720
say this is this was a good result and

574
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,720
over time this then shapes the policy

575
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,280
so the re uh enforcement learning

576
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,520
algorithm then modifies the behavior

577
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,760
over time because the agent's goal is to

578
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,919
maximize its rewards and get as many

579
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,159
positive rewards as possible and this

580
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,320
will filter out the bad behavior

581
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,240
over time but of course it's time

582
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,120
consuming so your agent will probably

583
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,440
bump the ball around thousand times

584
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,760
before it starts learning that it's

585
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,760
actually bad what it's trying to do

586
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,840
there

587
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,760
now um for the application of it in in

588
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,240
the area of cyber security

589
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
there are some challenges as i said

590
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,520
already that

591
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,760
it is um

592
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,200
time consuming but also um

593
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,039
the the thing is that real world

594
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,840
problems are usually have a large

595
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,240
have a large state in action space so a

596
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,200
lot of possible states a lot of possible

597
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,440
actions that could be taken

598
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,280
and as a consequence reinforcement

599
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
learning is now usually combined with

600
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,679
deep learning approaches we come back to

601
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,039
this in a bit

602
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:45,919
and

603
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,799
this is still a quite let's say a quite

604
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,799
new thing um

605
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,000
and the first great success with this

606
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,960
was in about 2015 with um

607
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,840
maybe you've heard of it alphago uh by

608
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,400
google so a kind of a

609
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,440
machine that taught itself playing the

610
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,080
board game go and then

611
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,440
became so good uh that it defeated not

612
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,960
just the the best human players but also

613
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,520
the the best machine players around at

614
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,799
that time

615
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,480
so

616
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,640
so far the greatest success

617
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,880
of this has been in other domains like

618
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,760
video and board games or even robotics

619
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,400
and autonomous driving but there are

620
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,360
some

621
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,559
yeah

622
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,559
scenarios where it's considered and

623
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,640
experimented with uh in the field of

624
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,600
cyber security so one thing is for

625
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,400
example cyber physical systems so

626
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,440
meaning iot industrial internet smart

627
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,679
grids smart cities so basically

628
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,760
everything that's smart

629
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,720
and

630
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,799
you take the the

631
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,360
yeah the sensor input

632
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,640
of the or the sensor input of the device

633
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,799
defines its states

634
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,159
and

635
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,200
by training it um certain changes in its

636
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,520
state and in a sense it might help it to

637
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,679
detect if it's for example is if it's

638
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,039
under attack

639
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,559
and to select the appropriate action

640
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,880
so you kind of get a

641
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,760
device that can defend itself because it

642
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,400
knows how to react and which actions to

643
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,720
take if it detects some

644
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,120
malicious things going on with the

645
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,960
sensors

646
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,600
another area where it's

647
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
applied is for intrusion detection

648
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,159
systems but more as in addition to

649
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,559
other learning approaches so

650
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,640
combined with supervisor unsupervised

651
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,600
learning

652
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,799
and the aim is to

653
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,720
enable systems to choose more

654
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,279
appropriate log files for example when

655
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,240
looking for traces of an attack

656
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,279
by

657
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,520
giving kind of a reinforcement

658
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,840
additional reinforcement loop which will

659
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,559
give a reward or a penalty when a system

660
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,279
selects a log file that does or does not

661
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,159
contain um anomalies or signs of an

662
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,080
attack so that over time the system will

663
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,000
get back better selecting those log

664
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,360
files

665
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,120
and a really interesting area of

666
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,960
application is the one of uh yeah game

667
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,000
theory

668
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,559
so with game theory we can model the

669
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,880
conflict and cooperation between

670
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,200
intelligent decision makers so basically

671
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,120
describing for example an

672
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,480
attacker and a defender

673
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,159
fighting over

674
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,360
an asset

675
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,720
and this is exactly what um

676
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,120
experiment what was experimented with so

677
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,080
you have two agents the attacker the

678
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,200
defender

679
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,520
both act against each other and try to

680
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,679
learn the optimal attack and defense

681
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,279
strategy

682
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,159
but the problem with this that is that

683
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,320
it of course simplifies the real world

684
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,880
cyber security problems into a very

685
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,760
limited game of just two players and

686
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,320
with one two asset switch which is

687
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,799
usually not the case in in the real

688
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,159
world

689
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,159
now the most common

690
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,880
yeah algorithm use as i said is

691
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,440
when you uh combine reinforcement

692
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,600
learning with deep learning this is why

693
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,120
i want to look or give look the give the

694
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,640
deep learning also a closer look

695
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,200
so deep learning usually refers to the

696
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,600
use of neural networks

697
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,640
and

698
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,720
the neural networks is based on the

699
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,880
working principle of neurons in our

700
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,039
brain

701
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,640
if we look at a

702
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,919
model of an artificial neuron we receive

703
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,840
a certain input so in real life certain

704
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,520
um yeah a certain input from our senses

705
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,000
and uh those go through synapses

706
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,880
into our neuron and those synapses have

707
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,200
a certain strength that amplify or

708
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,679
weaken the input so these are called

709
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,039
white weights in the artificial neuron

710
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,520
and this determines of which input is

711
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,640
more or

712
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,919
less significant for our case

713
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,640
now the neuron will sum up all the input

714
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,679
we get

715
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,760
and then compare it to a threshold value

716
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,039
and if this threshold value is exceeded

717
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,240
the neuron will fire and meaning it will

718
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,279
produce a kind of a positive output

719
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,520
which is also called the activation

720
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,200
function

721
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,399
now in deep learning we

722
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,880
have multiple layers so a simple neural

723
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,600
network just has the one neural layer in

724
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,960
between in deep learning we have

725
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,320
multiple so the input of

726
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,720
the output of one layer is the input of

727
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,360
the next layer and each layer will bring

728
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
more complexity

729
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,880
uh to the

730
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,440
to the table so thinking about image

731
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,320
recognition it's um

732
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,559
so the first layer might be able to

733
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,000
identify edges the second layer

734
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,159
might identify a combination of x edges

735
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,880
the third might identify certain

736
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,880
features like eyes or mouth and the last

737
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,840
identifies combinations of features like

738
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,000
a certain face

739
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,080
um

740
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,760
now uh so

741
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,480
how does the learning then work in those

742
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,919
networks so the the training means that

743
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,640
we will again have an iterative process

744
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,000
where we tune those weights so the

745
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,120
strength of the synapses and the biases

746
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,520
or the threshold values within the

747
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,960
neurons

748
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,919
in each neuron in each layer until we

749
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,080
finally get the um

750
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,080
yeah get close to to what what we want

751
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,159
and so at the end there's always a

752
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,159
so-called cost function

753
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,240
which uh will determine the degree to

754
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,880
which the output we get now differs from

755
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,880
the expected output and um the result is

756
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,760
then pushed back across all the neurons

757
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,120
for for tuning those values

758
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,440
i see i'm getting a bit darker let me

759
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,640
enlighten myself a bit

760
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,360
okay

761
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,399
now

762
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,080
um

763
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,440
having learned about the basic

764
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,799
principles let's uh sum up um a bit on

765
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,799
the opportunities how we can actually

766
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,600
use this for our purposes so we've seen

767
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,080
already some examples but

768
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,520
the the main

769
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,640
areas where it's now applied and indeed

770
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,000
promising is

771
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,480
auto automation for example so that it

772
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,000
takes over repetitive tasks that such as

773
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,120
triaging and triaging

774
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,080
or log analysis or

775
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,880
so

776
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,120
that human analysts can then actually

777
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
concentrate on the really difficult

778
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,799
stuff

779
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,600
also most promising is again to actually

780
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,039
combine it with

781
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,159
with humans so enhance human analysis

782
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,559
for example to reduce human error but

783
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,720
also to increase efficiency

784
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,279
so there was a very promising experiment

785
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,519
at the mit's computer science and

786
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,000
artificial intelligence lab

787
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,159
called ai square

788
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,720
for log analysis and what they did is

789
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,039
that they had first supervised learning

790
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,840
algorithms that finds extreme and rare

791
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,440
events and logs

792
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,720
and those events get then reviewed by

793
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,320
human analysts which will label them as

794
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,240
this is normal or this is indeed an

795
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,720
attack indicator and now we have labeled

796
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,360
data and can feed this back in a

797
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,440
supervised learning loop

798
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,640
and based on this input then and also

799
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,799
the one what from the unsupervised

800
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:55,840
learning

801
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,360
part can do a prediction if an attack is

802
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,080
imminent imminent or not and

803
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,360
during this ex

804
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,679
experiment the attack detection rate

805
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,919
actually rose to 85 percent and heavily

806
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,600
decreased the false positives

807
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
also it can help us to improve threat

808
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,919
response time so by

809
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,480
pulling the data actually

810
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,080
required or really relevant data um

811
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,840
from from log files um

812
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,880
so we can

813
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,120
prepare them for analysis so that cyber

814
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,000
security teams get more simplified

815
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,679
reports making the

816
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,279
most important things or highlighting

817
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,760
the most important things and then can

818
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,279
make decisions um faster

819
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,000
and it's kind of like yeah of course the

820
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,080
dream that maybe also

821
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,600
at a certain point of time machine

822
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,760
learning might be able to detect zero

823
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,279
days so there have been of course some

824
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,840
studies and experiments on this but

825
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,799
i'd say um we are not entirely there so

826
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:01,840
usually

827
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,600
if you have something

828
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,080
completely new your model has never seen

829
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,919
it of course will have problem dealing

830
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,679
with it so um yeah yeah we're not quite

831
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,919
there yet

832
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,960
so

833
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,120
there are of course some problems and

834
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,279
challenges as i already mentioned i

835
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,600
already said you have general problems

836
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,240
during the training like um overfitting

837
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,600
it's like you you train on on your data

838
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,000
set like learning for a test and uh

839
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,080
getting sample questions and learning

840
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,000
exactly those sample questions and their

841
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,159
answers and then you get in the actual

842
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,799
test different questions and you

843
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,200
perform bad that's the problem of

844
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,399
overfitting

845
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,279
um underfitting means we have not

846
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,600
trained it enough so we have not studied

847
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,399
enough and then we also will not perform

848
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,600
well

849
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,159
also a problem is always dimensionality

850
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,960
so the more the mind dimensions and

851
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,000
factors and features we have to learn

852
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,240
and the more data we

853
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,679
is required

854
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,919
and again there's this inductive bias so

855
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,000
there are certain assumptions we made to

856
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,159
make for example when extracting the

857
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,599
feature vector

858
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,040
and

859
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,599
this has of course

860
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,159
an impact on the results we get

861
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,199
especially in machine in cyber security

862
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,480
a huge problem is also the shortage of

863
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,280
data or especially the shortage of label

864
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,639
data

865
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,399
and

866
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,560
then the imbalance of data set we have

867
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,960
so usually your ratio should be like

868
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,119
something like 1 to 10 so

869
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,159
in

870
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,399
10

871
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,639
yeah 10

872
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,359
normal emails have one spam email for

873
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,839
example

874
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,760
um but in cyber security

875
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,239
this is usually a lot higher so you have

876
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,320
a lot for example a lot of benign

877
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,399
traffic and just a very few malicious

878
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,320
samples

879
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,599
also think about the consequences so if

880
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,079
you if your model does produce false

881
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,599
positive

882
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,839
you lose work time and confidence in the

883
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,839
system but think of the false negatives

884
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,160
if your model isn't working good enough

885
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,000
so the worst cases of course you can

886
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,200
have a full system compromise

887
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,400
and another great problem is um that

888
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,000
often we want results to being

889
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,160
interpretable so

890
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,240
we want to know why a certain output is

891
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,040
made so why did the algorithm choose

892
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,280
maybe for example a certain

893
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,520
um

894
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,160
log file or a certain right did it

895
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,240
suggest as a certain category in

896
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,320
classification and it's kind of

897
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,359
difficult to see under the hood on which

898
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,480
basis um this is made so it's kind of

899
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,720
makes it difficult to explain

900
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,880
and of course the world changes usually

901
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,160
quicker than

902
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,560
models or there's always time as i said

903
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,839
required from

904
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,240
changes until a model can adapt to those

905
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,480
changes so you have new protocols coming

906
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,680
up new types of activities and malware

907
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,839
and this is of course also a

908
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:12,960
challenge so

909
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,079
my last

910
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,079
five minutes uh

911
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,880
let's look on the other side of the coin

912
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,520
so we've seen um a lot of cases where we

913
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,000
could use machine learning but also have

914
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,079
a look at how machine learning can be

915
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,280
abused

916
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,000
and the first cve

917
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,960
for machine learning component was

918
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,640
published in 1919

919
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,800
which was for an email protection system

920
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,320
so you see

921
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,560
the attackers never sleep

922
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,760
and by the end of 2020 my

923
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,839
cooperation with microsoft and other

924
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,720
companies published this adversarial

925
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,640
machine learning threat matrix as a

926
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,119
framework to for detecting responding

927
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,920
and remediating threats so in in

928
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,599
highlighted and white are threats that

929
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,599
are really on techniques

930
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,000
specific to machine learning systems and

931
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,480
as you can see there are quite a lot and

932
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,880
in grey there are techniques that are

933
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
applicable to both machine learning

934
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,359
non-machine learning systems

935
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,720
and due to the time i could just um

936
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,680
i just picked two very small examples to

937
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,680
demonstrate this

938
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,440
two types of

939
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440
attacks here

940
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,079
poisoning and evasion

941
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:32,960
so

942
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,359
poisoning

943
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,760
is something that usually happens or

944
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,839
happens during training

945
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:40,800
meaning

946
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
uh the attacker is somehow able for

947
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,640
example to modify

948
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,240
labels if you want to do some

949
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,880
classification or to inject adversarial

950
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,960
samples into the training data set and

951
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,200
the best example for this is actually

952
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,760
from 2016 um microsoft's chatbot tai who

953
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,200
i think

954
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,800
who remembers this so this was a

955
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,760
chatbot

956
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,920
program to learn from interactions with

957
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,720
users so the user text it got was

958
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,880
actually the input and it had to be

959
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,920
taken down 24 hours later as it has

960
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,640
become sexist and racist so

961
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,480
means of course if you give it poisoned

962
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,720
input you will get poisoned output

963
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,760
and

964
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,800
another

965
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,280
very well famous let's say famous

966
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,760
example is evasion it's kind of like the

967
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,280
most common uh type of attack you have

968
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,880
so you try to design input that is then

969
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,680
wrongly classified by the machine

970
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,720
learning model and i've chosen here an

971
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,480
example from

972
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,079
from defcon 2019 the stealth shirt so

973
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,599
you have an object detection camera so

974
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,760
whenever you've seen the green square it

975
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,640
detected an object and as you can see

976
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,480
whenever he doesn't cover um the front

977
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,800
of his shirt

978
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,359
he is not detected so this is how the

979
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,040
stealth should

980
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,839
work so kind of confuse um

981
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,079
the um

982
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,280
yeah the algorithms so it doesn't detect

983
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,079
the model and this has also been shown

984
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,240
in research for example by

985
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,359
um

986
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,520
putting stickers on stop signs which

987
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,000
then get miss classified guy miss miss

988
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,040
classy

989
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,400
cry to not no longer stop signs but like

990
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,320
a speed limit 30 or 50 signs which is of

991
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,040
course if you think of um autonomous

992
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,720
vehicles uh really bad if this

993
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,240
was a successful attack

994
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,280
and

995
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,119
last but not least of course we cannot

996
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,480
just attack um machine learning but we

997
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,640
can also use machine learning for our

998
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,359
attacks so with with everything

999
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,920
everything can kind of be used

1000
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,200
as a weapon

1001
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,079
and there has have been some examples

1002
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,800
showing this successfully like breaking

1003
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,839
uh the google capture with machine

1004
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,319
learning or generating passwords or

1005
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,280
creating more concise lists based on on

1006
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,920
data on the user which make password

1007
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,000
cracking then more successful

1008
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,319
that you create um

1009
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,680
malware that can then evade um

1010
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,240
anti-malware engines or also for

1011
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,800
advanced phishing attacks so for example

1012
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,640
the um

1013
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,880
that tweets fishing posts targeting a

1014
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,119
specific user and

1015
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,680
seeding those posts dynamically based on

1016
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,319
topics extracted from the timeline and

1017
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,680
posts of the target and the user he

1018
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,240
interacts with and retweets and follows

1019
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,720
which makes it then really hard to

1020
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,359
detect that this is indeed

1021
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,839
fishing

1022
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,040
okay

1023
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,680
this concludes my presentation i hope

1024
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,520
you gained a good overview of the topic

1025
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,319
and

1026
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,720
i'm happy to answer

1027
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,520
questions now

1028
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,680
thank you very much claudia

1029
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,319
and let's wait a little bit to see if

1030
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,800
people have any questions

1031
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,960
again you can write the question here in

1032
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,680
uh

1033
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,680
in zoom or even in slack we will answer

1034
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,359
those in the meanwhile

1035
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,040
um i want to ask something claudia um

1036
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,319
i mean first and foremost great

1037
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,160
presentation thank you very much i feel

1038
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,920
like was very informative and especially

1039
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,480
talking about a quite complex topic we

1040
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,160
could be i mean it's actually easy it

1041
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
has a lot of stuff going on a lot of

1042
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,800
winning parts but i felt like it was

1043
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,079
really easy

1044
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,359
broke down

1045
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,760
and and you know and and sent to us you

1046
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,400
know so that was was great uh i have a

1047
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,760
question now then have you have you

1048
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,520
surveyed or do you have an understanding

1049
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,400
of how much learning has been applied in

1050
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,720
nowadays security cyber security

1051
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,720
solutions on what the one that they

1052
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,599
claim that they have machine learning

1053
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,240
on their solutions and if you do i mean

1054
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,920
what would your you know what do you

1055
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,760
think about that um

1056
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,359
is there anything any

1057
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,960
something that you want to comment on

1058
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,800
those

1059
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,319
um

1060
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,240
just let me repeat your question to make

1061
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
sure absolutely yes i

1062
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,720
understood it right so um

1063
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,760
so

1064
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,839
where has it actually been applied

1065
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,680
um and yeah

1066
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,040
how well basically or um

1067
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,960
in general i was asking if you had a

1068
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,319
look at other uh softwares or services

1069
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,440
in the internet they claim that they

1070
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,880
promote machine learning as their

1071
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,040
product if you have a look at you know

1072
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,599
what do you think about implementation

1073
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,560
of course uh this is usually the problem

1074
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,160
that you can't really look under the

1075
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,119
hood of the product so um because this

1076
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,960
is kind of what their business is built

1077
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,760
on

1078
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,359
um

1079
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,560
but uh

1080
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,880
for sure you can see that like in

1081
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,839
so it's mostly now and

1082
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,079
let's say more more products for for the

1083
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,119
blue team like i said like like splunk

1084
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,960
or dark trace so

1085
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,280
they actually they couldn't do what they

1086
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,839
do if it wasn't real machine learning or

1087
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,440
more concrete really deep learning that

1088
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,280
they apply so you can be pretty sure

1089
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,079
they're actually uh um losing it

1090
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,400
the question is you get

1091
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,720
very little on information on what

1092
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,119
exactly they're using so they usually of

1093
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,119
course say okay we have some deep

1094
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,599
learning applied here but

1095
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,079
they they won't give you details on the

1096
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,599
models or

1097
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,400
often also not so it's

1098
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,319
often also the question what training

1099
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,720
data do they use for example to actually

1100
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,839
get their models trained

1101
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,240
um this is also something you should

1102
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,920
maybe ask the vendor when you consider

1103
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,560
using their services but um

1104
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,680
don't expect them to really give you an

1105
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,560
a

1106
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,880
very informative answer on that because

1107
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,560
yeah that's a kind of part of their

1108
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,560
secret

1109
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,400
yeah i can imagine that i can imagine

1110
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,040
that they can you know um

1111
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,040
play in this regard you know what they

1112
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,839
have um and also understand that some of

1113
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,280
them you know they just

1114
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,280
it's not easy to figure out if someone

1115
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,200
is using that but it's good to have some

1116
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,280
pointers and especially understand right

1117
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,240
if the

1118
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,160
you know the outcome is expected to be

1119
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,640
from machine learning or just a bunch of

1120
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,280
i don't know crown scripts you know and

1121
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,920
then they just analyze the data and then

1122
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,000
so so that's why that's why i was asking

1123
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,800
if you had any of the experience yeah so

1124
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,880
you can be actually pretty sure if you

1125
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,760
have those large really really large

1126
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,119
amounts of data um

1127
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,000
the best way to handle this um for those

1128
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,920
use cases i showed is this machine

1129
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,000
learning you can't actually

1130
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,440
yeah or

1131
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,599
would take a lot of more processing

1132
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,920
power to do it otherwise and so it's

1133
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,319
kind of there also the economic option

1134
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,480
to go for to use machine learning in

1135
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,119
those cases

1136
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,800
so we have a question uh from pablo uh

1137
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,280
do you know an example of use of machine

1138
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,280
learning to evaluate estimate risk

1139
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,040
for risk estimation

1140
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,720
i think he's actually more about yeah

1141
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,640
business yeah it's called like yeah he's

1142
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,720
kind of governed and policies

1143
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,680
not out of top of my head but

1144
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,839
let me do just uh

1145
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,920
let me yeah and the answer to you maybe

1146
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,000
a bit later and uh

1147
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,560
have a closer look at this but yeah yeah

1148
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,160
in the channel yeah we can you can reply

1149
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,079
to the selection or tweet about it let's

1150
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,160
see

1151
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,119
okay

1152
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,200
so i think there are no more questions

1153
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,160
again thank you very much claudia
