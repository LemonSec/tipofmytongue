1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,360
okay so i'm miller thief and with me is

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,359
albert calvo

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,840
and we will be presenting

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,279
open uva

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,279
it's a framework

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,080
to do some user and entity behavior

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,359
analytics

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,640
and as is the name it implies it's an

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,840
open open source framework

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,800
but before we start uh

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
a little bit of introduction of where we

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,600
came like we are working on i2cap it's a

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,640
foundation

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,280
for non-profit

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,680
innovation center so basically we do

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,480
research and innovation on a lot of

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,879
topics

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,680
and well these are mainly our areas of

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,640
of research like we have a lot of 5g

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,080
cyber security

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,400
artificial intelligence blockchain but

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
we also do

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,640
some

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,400
other kind of projects like virtual

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,000
reality

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,799
or right now we are delving into the the

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,880
new space area

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,640
and mainly these projects are motivated

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,840
from

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,280
public collaborations with

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
administrations

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,119
within the

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,360
european commission or by companies we

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,479
try to

35
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,520
expand as much as we can and foster this

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,360
kind of

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,159
innovation ecosystem so

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,200
the technologies can reach

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,960
all places

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,119
and well this is

41
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,000
a little bit the team that is involved

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
in this project

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,000
as you will see i don't look

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,320
like on the picture but

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,680
it was taken

46
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,399
a long time ago

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and now a little bit about

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,560
the the project so open uava as

49
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,959
interesting price it's open

50
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,080
and it's one of the

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,800
the keys of the of our project because

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,080
we've seen that sure there are a lot of

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,640
ubi solutions and projects and basically

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
almost any technology is integrating

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
uva

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
technologies but

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
it's always into this kind of black box

58
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,560
where you don't really know what's going

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,879
on inside you don't know

60
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,640
how anything is being calculated they

61
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,560
just tell you it's

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
it's using artificial intelligence and

63
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,360
that you should just trust it

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,239
but

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,720
it's very hard especially in the cyber

66
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,239
security context

67
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,640
to to really assess if

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,280
this output that

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,519
the ai is giving you it's actually

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,239
correct or or not because

71
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,480
it can actually lead you to

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,400
to misinterpret or to apply

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,640
the wrong mitigations or the wrong

74
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,080
solutions

75
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,680
to your problems

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,560
so

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,840
for us it's very important

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,040
also because since ai is being

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,239
kind of the keyword that floats every

80
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,920
every product every technology

81
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,319
everything right now is with it working

82
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,760
with ai

83
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,560
and being able to have it exposed and

84
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,599
that

85
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,000
anyone can just go and check the code

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,799
see what's the logic behind

87
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,159
the

88
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,280
logistics and how it actually works

89
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,840
it really helps

90
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,720
building our trust with the

91
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,680
output

92
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,519
of this ai

93
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,799
plus we are also integrating

94
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,760
the cyber fire intelligence key

95
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,519
that way

96
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,319
we are kind of deviating from the

97
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,680
the usual model

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,799
where

99
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,959
all these tools that usually works with

100
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:07,760
ai

101
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,840
they just focus on detecting anomalies

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,439
or seeing

103
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,798
variations of

104
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,358
on a specific time scale

105
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,040
or even just

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,560
implementing some strategic rules

107
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,440
but we go beyond that and

108
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,680
insert this part of the intelligence

109
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,960
that we will see

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,320
a little bit deeper later

111
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,320
and now

112
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,280
to

113
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,120
to talk about the high part i will leave

114
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,400
the floor to my colleague over

115
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,199
okay so thanks nick so i will present a

116
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,040
little bit the framework that we are

117
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,440
working on

118
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,840
[Music]

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
okay

120
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
so mainly the freckle that we presented

121
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,960
today is focus on user and entity

122
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,440
behavioral analytics which is targeted

123
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,080
on monitoring the user behavior to

124
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,160
detect anomalies activities and

125
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,639
highlight malicious patterns

126
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,600
so in marketing behavioral studies has

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
been done for years so based on the

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
analysis in which always the customer

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,120
stops

130
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,199
for for example is it possible to

131
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,080
predict if the customer will purchase a

132
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,919
certain emitter

133
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,880
or or we can offer them personal asset

134
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,400
discounts

135
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,240
this behavior and analysis can be

136
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,360
applied into the cyber security domain

137
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,800
analyzing the

138
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
the baseline user behavior we can

139
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,120
highlight deviations from the normal

140
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,240
behavior

141
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,120
so let me give an example if an user

142
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,639
sends a periodic image to all coworkers

143
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,039
it could be a normal activity saying it

144
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,120
is from human resources

145
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,319
but if another user for example from the

146
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,759
deep team

147
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,919
has this kind of activity it can be

148
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,400
flycast anomalous

149
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,120
to this end it is conceptualized to

150
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,960
build a framework for behavioral

151
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,600
analysis mainly the framework is that is

152
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
divided into three different components

153
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,080
the user profiles

154
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,919
well the user profiling so the

155
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,800
multimodal sources are joined into a

156
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,520
feature vector represent in the user

157
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,039
behavior

158
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,960
the thread profiling so from the

159
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,199
different thread intelligence sources

160
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,440
are extracted indicators

161
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,280
which represent the different attack

162
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,400
vectors

163
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,039
and finally the risk calculation

164
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,759
with a compute alignment between the

165
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,720
user profiles and threats

166
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,520
so

167
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,840
in detail the main benefits of our

168
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,639
proposed framework are the following the

169
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,520
efficiency so the ability to scale up

170
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,919
from small scenarios to complex

171
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,840
institutions with thousands of hundred

172
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,680
entities transparency by design

173
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,400
so the framework is built using the

174
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,160
principle the principle of transparency

175
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,680
so to this

176
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
it will be open source allowing third

177
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,479
parties to modify the software as they

178
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,599
need

179
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,560
are standardization so we use sticks and

180
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,120
capex frameworks to represent and share

181
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,520
thread data

182
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,240
okay so to build and evaluate the of the

183
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,199
opening with uva framework we have

184
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,080
access to a real life data set

185
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,319
in detail is data from a local

186
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,759
university with our own around 20 000

187
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,759
users including

188
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,800
student professors and staff

189
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,520
in detail to perform the first version

190
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
of framework we take into account the

191
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,039
following multiple of sources

192
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,840
the network data which is information

193
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,960
captured on premises hardware

194
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,440
informed data which is information

195
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,759
captured using ganache

196
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,479
and application data which is log data

197
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,639
or forward the data from asia

198
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,720
okay so the user profiling steps

199
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,120
allows the extraction of relevant

200
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,759
information from sources and structure

201
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,639
them into future vectors

202
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,919
so here to perform these analysis we use

203
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,839
autocoders which allows us to build

204
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,039
representations of the different data

205
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,000
sources and after that are merged into

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,399
the same filter space

207
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,480
these representations allow us to

208
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,600
compare the user behavior at the certain

209
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,360
moment against

210
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
the historical

211
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,560
behavior

212
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,120
and also the comparison against similar

213
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,800
users in the organization

214
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,680
so

215
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,760
next or next model that we are

216
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,880
presenting

217
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,600
is the thread profile

218
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,480
that is started to extract and structure

219
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,320
knowledge from threat intelligence

220
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,680
sources

221
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,600
here what we want to compute are

222
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,399
rotations which are deviation from node

223
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,680
threads

224
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,080
so we compute these mutations using

225
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,959
historical data from certain intelligent

226
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,399
sources

227
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,200
so for instance the indicators of a

228
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,080
phishing attack are the following

229
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,519
the user

230
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,560
receives an email with an attachment

231
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,040
then the user extract and open our

232
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,480
document and finally enable some macros

233
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,959
the proposed votations know the skill

234
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,120
chains are the following

235
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,279
so they change

236
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,080
they check use a similar indicator

237
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,640
in this case it receive an excel

238
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,120
or transformation two

239
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,519
where some optional indicators are

240
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,640
missing

241
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,680
and finally the transformation tree

242
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,920
where some parts of the atom vector are

243
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
replaced according to historical

244
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,640
indicators

245
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,320
well so the final step of our framework

246
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,399
it it could be the

247
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,040
the alignment so we align the user

248
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
profile with the different attack

249
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,880
vectors that we compute in the thread

250
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
profiling model

251
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,120
with this the output of our framework is

252
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,760
a score where for each user it is

253
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,959
calculate the exposure to mean 3x

254
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,920
as well as we can see here

255
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,720
an example of the output

256
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,360
so so well so no need will explain an

257
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,519
example of how the fever threat

258
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,360
intelligence can be applied to

259
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,320
behavioral analysis so nil the floor is

260
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,570
yours

261
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,720
[Applause]

262
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,720
thanks

263
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,279
yeah so how do we apply this

264
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,880
cell intelligence

265
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,959
into our platform because there are many

266
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,959
ways of consuming certain intelligence

267
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,640
right you can

268
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,000
just just

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,519
take your diocese and fit them to the cm

270
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,760
or just do reports

271
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,920
but in our case

272
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,600
we are interested in more than just iocs

273
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,360
we are also interested

274
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,399
in the

275
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,760
in the tdps

276
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,640
and

277
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
the indicators of attack

278
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,720
so we

279
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,440
to detect this behavior we go

280
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
one level higher on the on the pyramid

281
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,959
of pain

282
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,040
that way

283
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,360
even if the indicators of compromise

284
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,839
change we can still

285
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,959
correlate

286
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,040
the same behavior of

287
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
some pattern or some attack

288
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,160
to

289
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,959
the same kind of reactor or even to

290
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,600
detect similar behaviors

291
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,480
so

292
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,959
in this case uh we gather ultra

293
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,000
intelligence from multiple sources

294
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,839
it could be like five hours or the

295
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:08,880
future

296
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,440
and this kind of premium sources which

297
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,240
have

298
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,120
a high high reach

299
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,959
intelligence about

300
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,839
how so malware operates or

301
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,920
how a campaign is set up or even how

302
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,360
other doctor

303
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,440
kind of works and all the tools that it

304
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,560
uses

305
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
and with this

306
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,720
we

307
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,079
use it to open up a using

308
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,360
using sticks as format

309
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,839
and

310
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,200
when we have it on open uva you we use

311
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,240
it

312
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,519
to do

313
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,480
the

314
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,560
set profiling that way

315
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,839
we can

316
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,680
perform a model of

317
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,160
the thread that we are trying

318
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,800
to to match with the model

319
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,120
of the user profile

320
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,000
that it's being monitored that way

321
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,279
we can see if the activity of one user

322
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,360
kind of resembles or

323
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,720
it's

324
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,839
similar

325
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,040
to a specific threat

326
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,399
and

327
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,839
of course

328
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,519
the way

329
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,120
detection of monitoring usually works is

330
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,920
that whenever you see

331
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,079
an indicator or

332
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,519
on your environment

333
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,600
then you just raise a flag

334
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,959
but in here

335
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,600
we don't really need to to have

336
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,639
the full spectrum of the attack or

337
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,519
even

338
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,839
have all the steps

339
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,639
being

340
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,720
successfully seen

341
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,079
this way

342
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,399
if we see that some user

343
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,480
has a behavior

344
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,120
that kind of resembles some attack like

345
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,920
maybe

346
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,360
he's just performed

347
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,199
80 percent of the actions or 60

348
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,279
of the actions that the

349
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,399
threat or

350
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,040
the malware or the fishing campaign

351
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,639
usually does

352
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,760
we can already assess that this user

353
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,120
has a high a high risk towards this kind

354
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
of threat

355
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,800
and we can even use

356
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,519
the

357
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,920
our knowledge that we have observed of

358
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,880
this user prior to

359
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
the actual

360
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
events that we have seen

361
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
to enrich with further observables

362
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,560
our previous intelligence

363
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,160
right so if we've seen that

364
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,320
some phishing campaign usually uses

365
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,360
certain domains but in this case

366
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,800
we see that

367
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,399
the user followed

368
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,760
every step

369
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,680
but instead of

370
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,040
receiving a mail

371
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,279
he

372
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,880
got into this

373
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,959
introduced domain from

374
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,279
a team's link or

375
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,360
some icon the limitation we can also

376
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,959
add this into also intelligence and

377
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,079
enrich it even more

378
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,720
and well even further we can add also

379
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,480
mutations to known protectors using

380
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,279
iocs from other feeds like you would

381
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,839
have on your miss or your taxi or your

382
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,199
yeti or any other platform that

383
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,720
uses

384
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,040
this kind of fit aggregators

385
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,720
to

386
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,199
to benefit from different religions

387
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,360
and well let's see

388
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,079
for example in this case

389
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,120
we have

390
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,920
the behavioral model of when i cry i

391
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,519
hope

392
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,440
you can see it properly

393
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,120
but for example in here we have detailed

394
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,480
every every step that when i cry is

395
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
usually performing so

396
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,079
we see

397
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,959
the name of the services that uses the

398
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,600
name of the processors that it uses

399
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,160
which commands is using with each

400
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,199
process

401
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,800
what kind of actions

402
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,160
each process is performing and what kind

403
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,279
of traffic

404
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,560
these

405
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,160
when i cry

406
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,199
it's

407
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,720
generating

408
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,959
so

409
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,759
you know rotation of cm or

410
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,199
antivirus

411
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,079
or

412
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,440
any kind of

413
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,800
standard solution

414
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,199
we will have to detect

415
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,199
something specific from

416
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,800
these three

417
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,839
but in our case

418
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
whenever we see

419
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,279
a certain amount of steps

420
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,759
of this workflow being actually

421
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,880
processed

422
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,720
we can we can already

423
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,800
raise the flag and said hey

424
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,279
this user it's kind of behaving like

425
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,120
when i cry

426
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,399
you might wanna

427
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,759
look into the

428
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,440
further

429
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,680
and even if

430
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,040
tomorrow

431
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
this model were to change and instead of

432
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,480
using a specific process or instead of

433
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,799
using

434
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,439
summer traffic it were to use another

435
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,559
protocol

436
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,400
we could also

437
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,959
just uh tweak

438
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,000
the this model very quickly and that or

439
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,480
we could maybe even detect it directly

440
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,919
from our environment and already uh

441
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,240
enrich it further

442
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,840
into into our system

443
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,960
and of course

444
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,760
as everything this can also be

445
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,039
modeled into the meters direct framework

446
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,360
this gives us

447
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,400
and

448
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,679
huge context to to be able to actually

449
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,120
track and map

450
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,440
every single of these

451
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,919
of these steps into like

452
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,679
a proper framework

453
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,760
and this way it's also very easy for

454
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,160
companies and for pretty much everyone

455
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,960
to to integrate and be able to extract

456
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,160
context out of every single step right

457
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,440
you don't need to

458
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,320
to know exactly what everything is

459
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
actually doing like you don't need to

460
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,160
know the exact command or the exact

461
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,960
process what it is but you already know

462
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,840
that

463
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,960
it's related to a specific task of the

464
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240
metre

465
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,200
attack framework and this way you

466
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,360
you already have a very clear view of

467
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,000
what's happening

468
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
and for example this could be

469
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,840
uh

470
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,960
the same information as we've seen

471
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
before but in a graph

472
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,600
like in this case

473
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,520
we have a very

474
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,240
a very standard or a very

475
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,200
small sample of the im

476
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,960
ddos

477
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,280
model so this was

478
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
a us

479
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,320
service

480
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,400
that was running

481
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,280
it was pretty popular like 10 years ago

482
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,799
but it kind of

483
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,240
uses

484
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,039
a pattern that it's adopted by

485
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,480
many other

486
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,400
dls service nowadays

487
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,480
so in this way we only have for example

488
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,240
the

489
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,919
generating to

490
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,520
some c2 traffic

491
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,320
that it has a specific threshold on the

492
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,799
traffic and a specific threshold

493
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,240
on the

494
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,200
on the instances and we could have some

495
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,000
indicators of some effective host

496
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,360
but

497
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,559
translate this to the behavior

498
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,480
if we see

499
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,320
some connections

500
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,919
falling within

501
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,039
these thresholds and following this

502
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,320
pattern

503
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,760
we could

504
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,200
we could already

505
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,000
say that it's similar to this and start

506
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,080
enriching this model even if we

507
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,919
if we start from something very very

508
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,170
small right

509
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,589
[Applause]

510
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,840
and in the end like this could be

511
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,080
a representation of

512
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,400
some tool or some malware in this case

513
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,840
it's poison ivy

514
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,480
that we have a lot of intelligence

515
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,760
probably on this one

516
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,799
it's one of the most well documented

517
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,880
malware tools

518
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,919
so we have many many indicators

519
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:28,960
we have

520
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,799
a lot of information about it

521
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,280
and

522
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,919
this give us a representation of what we

523
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,120
should see on our network and of course

524
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,720
we will never see

525
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,919
like all the

526
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,159
all the hashes or all the samples

527
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,400
because

528
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,679
is not realistic right to see it but

529
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,480
maybe just seeing

530
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,240
similar

531
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,120
behavior to this already can give us

532
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,320
a pretty a pretty good understanding of

533
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,640
if the user eats

534
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,919
or might be

535
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,320
at risk of the

536
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,879
kind of tool

537
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,120
and

538
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,840
now we will speak a little bit about the

539
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
ecosystem

540
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,240
that we are building

541
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,760
so

542
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,919
this is as we said before

543
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,400
this is not a

544
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,120
specific tool or kind of a

545
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,360
script or a software like you can just

546
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,600
install this is a whole framework

547
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,840
and in this case we're using the elastic

548
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,000
stack with gracken

549
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,400
slot manager

550
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,400
and on the ai engine we're using flask

551
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
canal flow chaos

552
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,640
many ai technologies

553
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,840
for

554
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,600
the intelligent platform is using

555
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,720
opencti to store all those intelligence

556
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,919
information

557
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,280
but

558
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,720
this could be exchanged with any other

559
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,280
tool that you use for

560
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,840
for this purpose as long as

561
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,559
it uses the same kind of format on cell

562
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,760
intelligence if you can handle sticks

563
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,440
you can plug it into anything else

564
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,120
for us elementary for example we're

565
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,080
using

566
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,640
open mac enterprise which is from

567
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,280
a company named open cloud factory that

568
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,919
we're partnering with them to develop

569
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,440
this framework

570
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,200
well also

571
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,559
since aiu really needs some historical

572
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,919
data to

573
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,200
function properly we're also developing

574
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,760
a ticketing system collector which would

575
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,520
extract

576
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,880
doing some natural language processing

577
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,200
will extract information from past

578
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
incidents that you have on tickets

579
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,039
that usually

580
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,640
mostly getting systems

581
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,200
just have the information on plain text

582
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,679
and you don't really have

583
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,000
this kind of a standardized fields

584
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,200
or

585
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,480
in case you do with like the hive

586
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,120
then you could fit this data directly to

587
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,400
the core note that it's actually

588
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,480
kind of

589
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,360
the the keystone of the

590
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,799
of the framework and the one that

591
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,280
handles all the analysis being done

592
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,320
between the ai engine and everything

593
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,600
stored on the log manager

594
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
and well this is just

595
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,120
a little preview of the ui

596
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,240
what

597
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,120
we could see like just logging into the

598
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,039
under onto the framework

599
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,679
you will see already like the

600
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,279
the group of users that are the most at

601
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,240
risk

602
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,120
the threats that are affecting you the

603
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,159
most

604
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,799
uh a little bit of threat clustering

605
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,799
of your the current threads on your

606
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,360
network

607
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,000
also

608
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,279
another way of

609
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,520
searching for different threads or

610
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,760
different groups within

611
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,720
your network here

612
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,039
when

613
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,000
checking a specific loop we would see

614
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,559
a graph of the activity of the group of

615
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,520
users

616
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,799
how do the

617
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,799
relation between them

618
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,080
what's the

619
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,240
relationship between other groups of

620
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,600
users or between the users themselves

621
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,520
and

622
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,400
a little bit of

623
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,720
kind of a fierce glance

624
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,200
view of what's the state of this group

625
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,679
of users

626
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,679
and similarly we would see the same for

627
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,240
for slides like which group of users are

628
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,320
most affected for this threat

629
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,640
and see multiple kpis see graphs of

630
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,039
activity of the threat and how the

631
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,679
threat behaves

632
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,880
and well basically

633
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,480
right now we're also

634
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,520
trying to build a community based

635
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,279
upon

636
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,080
this open model since

637
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,279
we see that

638
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,640
one of the main issues that we find when

639
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,919
trying to work

640
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,320
with like solutions that use ai from the

641
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,600
cyber security domain is that

642
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,840
the people specialized are specialized

643
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,320
in artificial intelligence of course

644
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,880
have no idea of cyber security and the

645
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,960
people specialize on service security

646
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,640
have no idea of artificial intelligence

647
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,679
so

648
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,480
this framework is also a tool

649
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,960
to help both both sides to kind of join

650
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,159
and work together and since it's

651
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,919
open source

652
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:50,799
both

653
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,880
both sides can see

654
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,080
and

655
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,240
try to understand what's being done on

656
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
on the other side

657
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,840
uh well this is either contact reference

658
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,720
if

659
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,640
you wanna you wanna try

660
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,159
this framework

661
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,600
and

662
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,360
schedule a proof of concept with us or

663
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,919
directly join our team we're always

664
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,000
looking for people

665
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,400
not only on the cyber security domain

666
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,279
but

667
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,919
we have many other areas where we're

668
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,200
looking for people

669
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,039
or even if you are doing some master's

670
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,600
degree or some phd

671
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,159
and you wanna perform research with us

672
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,679
you can even send us an email to contact

673
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,159
at opengba.org

674
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,720
and

675
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,039
this will be it for the talk

676
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,640
thanks for everyone

677
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,039
for staying here if anyone has any

678
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,640
questions

679
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,640
we will be very happy to answer anything

680
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,960
yes great thank you uh

681
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,679
neil and albert uh well we give a couple

682
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,200
of minutes uh people again attendees uh

683
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,760
or people in youtube that want to

684
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,320
send you a question against luck or hear

685
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,120
zoom

686
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,000
um

687
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,400
i have a question actually uh this is

688
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,520
something interesting and actually it

689
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,480
was an area of that i was investigating

690
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,559
uh back then

691
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,520
uh i was actually wondering

692
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,520
you know you say that your solution

693
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,320
basically requires a network agent right

694
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,360
on top of uh you know an agent

695
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,919
like osquery that runs on a computer

696
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:30,880
right

697
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,720
um

698
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,200
you know how would that work in a in a

699
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,440
cloud environment where

700
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,320
more than again an analyzing uh

701
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,720
user in the sense of

702
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,360
you know physical users but you may want

703
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,440
to analyze

704
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,000
service accounts or

705
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,480
users within servers

706
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,279
but in a cloud environment like again

707
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,000
admin or routes activity or accounts

708
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,640
that are you know not proper human

709
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,080
beings but

710
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,320
uh we and then again i mentioned in the

711
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,240
network uh i was mentioning the network

712
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,399
part because i feel like that's perhaps

713
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,039
the most trickiest part in cloud to get

714
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,880
the kind of information so i'm not sure

715
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,480
if you have this use case if you thought

716
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,760
about that and if there is any uh i know

717
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,840
any way that we can do the same

718
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,120
um

719
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,039
i mean we're not treating right now this

720
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,320
kind of use case

721
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,840
but

722
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,039
the

723
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,559
agent and the sensor it's like one of

724
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,159
the

725
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,720
the main ways that we expect information

726
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,760
because

727
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,640
it's kind of our own means

728
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,440
but

729
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,360
the idea is that

730
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,200
you can

731
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,840
you can input

732
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,840
almost any kind of information about

733
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,760
user activity that you have on your

734
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,880
system like the same way you would do on

735
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,480
your cm if you

736
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,960
if you can analyze these logs on on the

737
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,679
cm you can just forward it to

738
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,640
the elastic sack that we're using

739
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,600
and

740
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,480
we'll perform kind of a similar analysis

741
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,880
maybe you will have to do some

742
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,600
some feature engineering to alter the

743
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,360
fields that you're using

744
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,840
to to comply with the elastic common

745
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,720
scheme

746
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,760
that

747
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,399
that we chose to use to keep on the

748
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,440
standards

749
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,240
for

750
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,320
for elastic stack

751
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,559
but but yeah i don't think it would

752
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,559
change that much since

753
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,120
the the same models can be applied

754
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
to

755
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,720
to kind of uh

756
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,880
i don't want to say everything but

757
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,480
but

758
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,200
in this in this context yeah it could be

759
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,799
it would be the same really because

760
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,880
we're also doing

761
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,000
not only

762
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,360
analysis or

763
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,279
on humans or as users but also entities

764
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,919
within within the network that could be

765
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:00,559
a

766
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,600
server account or maybe just a script

767
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,440
that is doing

768
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,320
the same actions every day and someday

769
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,918
you see deviating for some reason

770
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,840
i don't know if this

771
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
answers your input no no yeah no no

772
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,440
absolutely absolutely again my era of

773
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,919
expertise back then my research was more

774
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,200
about how could identify um

775
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,240
you know behaviors in servers mostly

776
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,880
from admin activities right uh because

777
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,960
you know if you know i get someone into

778
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,720
my server as a root accounts i mean i

779
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,880
understand that a legit

780
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,919
admin would perform a

781
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,159
typical set of actions right i don't

782
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,399
know running a specific set of commands

783
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,799
they could be ls pwd

784
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,679
whatever right but if the same user

785
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,320
start using you know and then i cluster

786
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,919
together those commands and say okay

787
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,600
these commands have some kind of like

788
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,320
weight and i was like okay if you use i

789
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,880
don't know pwd ls and you know you name

790
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,720
uh you know uh

791
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,840
sorry in id or um yeah you know in a

792
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,919
specific time frame it has some kind of

793
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,159
like it's a behavior that i may be okay

794
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,640
with and i assign like a weight but then

795
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,559
if in between someone run on a ps

796
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,080
run like a netstat or like a nc then i

797
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,840
definitely wants to flag that i really

798
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,440
want to fly there because it's kind of

799
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,600
like the admin is going outside the

800
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,080
behavior that i would expect

801
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,960
um

802
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,559
and therefore yeah i mean and that was

803
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,840
mostly about

804
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,440
but this happens in the cloud right and

805
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,679
without having pretty much no network

806
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,240
visibility uh it's quite expensive to

807
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,080
have that type of you know

808
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,799
data in the cloud so again i was also

809
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,279
figuring i was thinking if you know i i

810
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,360
guess i guess what your answer was about

811
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,440
is that as long as i comply with the

812
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,320
format in the in the elect in the you

813
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,799
know elasticstar stack the model is

814
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,480
trained to work on that data so as long

815
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,880
as i provide them that type of model i

816
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,960
should be good you know in anything

817
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,640
right so then at that point would be me

818
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,760
to create some sort of like

819
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,519
transformation data

820
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,000
in layer in between right to then

821
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,240
prepare the data for your platform if i

822
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,480
understand correctly then yeah because

823
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,559
in this case you would detect it with a

824
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,600
simple

825
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,720
anomaly

826
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,600
model

827
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,360
yeah yeah

828
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,039
my one is a very yeah mine was a very

829
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,799
simple use case

830
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,679
yeah our point in here is mostly focused

831
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,039
on

832
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,399
not only

833
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,919
doing this kind of detection on

834
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,760
anomalies on user behavior but also

835
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,960
in introducing the intelligent aspect

836
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,399
and mapping

837
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,960
these behaviors into

838
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,919
stress behaviors to also give more

839
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,440
context

840
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,120
and also

841
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,720
this is something that's

842
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,880
something overlooked but

843
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,240
in real world scenarios you

844
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,679
rarely see or have all the logs and all

845
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,320
the data that you would like to have and

846
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,559
even if you are actually logging it

847
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,880
most of the time it doesn't reach the

848
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,159
cyber security areas since

849
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,960
forwarding and storing locks it's really

850
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,159
expensive

851
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,480
and this way you don't really need to

852
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,200
see

853
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,919
the whole pattern or every indicator to

854
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,159
assess that something is a specific

855
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,960
thread if you see that the behavior kind

856
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
of resembles what you are expecting to

857
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,000
see from a thread you can already

858
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,240
tell

859
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,480
that it could be affected by it

860
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,960
all right yeah thank uh thank you guys i

861
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,799
don't see any questions so far

862
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,640
so what i would do

863
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,279
is again if you still have any questions

864
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,840
you can write me slack albert and neil

865
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,240
are there

866
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,120
i would i would thank you guys again for

867
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,159
having this talk it was cool interesting

868
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,880
i really enjoy it
