will quickly summarize the mobile

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,200
hacking case studies how the famous

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
mobile famous celebrities or people or

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,119
the professionals your phone got hacked

32

and the couple of uh like spyware

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,400
analysis i had done

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,880
comparison i had an analysis of several

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,240
spywares

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,000
and out of that

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,759
we will be presenting couple of uh

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,840
spyware's analysis

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,079
at this point uh in this presentation

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,479
i'm not not going to display disclose

41
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,479
any name of the spyware we will just

42
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,479
refer them as five over one square by

43
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,759
two spyware three okay we are we we have

44
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,600
uh uh obstructed all the vendor names

45
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
and overall uh

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,799
how was the

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,719
the comparison between the different

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,320
spywares

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,399
based on different factors and then the

50
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,880
conclusion

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,560
there was already introduction but i'll

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,038

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
application security okay this is a free

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
and open source project as this is a

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,000
relevant talk to the spyware i just want

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,720
to say i have i'm also lead for the os

project basis which is dedicated for the

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,200
uh ios application level security okay

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,080
um so if we um if you summarize my

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,239
background my background is not much

71
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,519
into the malware analysis or uh not much

72
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,760
into the next five years

73
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
if you see my all my career all my

74
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,680
industry experience work experience that

75
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,800
includes

76
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
application security cloud security or

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,239
offensive security or

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,840
i mean

79
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,680
when i talk about the mobile security or

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,159
the author of the book which the book

81
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,840
which i authored

82
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,920
they all talks about the application

83
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,680
level vulnerabilities like what is

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
application sandboxing the permission

85
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,599
levels the uh like the security issues

86
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,720
during the

87
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,200
transit dynamic analysis

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,519
or changing the application behavior you

89
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,159
know everything about more more

90
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,000
specifically about the application

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,599
security okay

92
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,879
and frankly it's not related with the

93
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,159
malware root kids or i mean analysis of

94
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,319
that of course i have uh the knowledge

95
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,640
of it but it's not in terms of

96
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,920
professionalism

97
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,959
but until one incident okay when the i

98
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,439
mean the pandemics started right uh it's

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,760
been two years

100
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,879
uh

101
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,640
it's two years everything has been

102
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
changed and one year back almost one

103
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,959
year back uh in the midnight i got a

104
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,799
call from frame

105
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,280
it was 2 30 a.m around

106
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,599
and he was really frightened and he said

107
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,000
that he's uh

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,199
his his father's phone has been hyped

109
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,919
okay he was using the iphone

110
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,080
and he said that his phone has been

111
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,600
hyped and

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,240
he uh he's i mean the private photos are

113
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,680
already uh

114
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,160
with that person the the they are

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,600
blackmailing

116
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,840
and the blackmailing is happening and

117
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,960
the passcode is also changed okay

118
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,280
and he asked me what to do

119
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,360
right it was middle in the middle of the

120
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
night and i never had

121
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,759
such experience in my life before that

122
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,199
because you know

123
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,120
i was i was not into sock team or

124
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,080
something where you will get the

125
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
incidents in the midnight i was mostly

126
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
in application i mean more of the you

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,080
know broad security team so

128
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
it was very unusual for me and he asked

129
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,160
me what to do right

130
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,960
so at that moment i was not sure i i

131
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,039
mean how his phone could have been hiked

132
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,240
right i just suggested like

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,080
what you can do with the at the best is

134
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,600
you can switch off the internet in the

135
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,080
phone and you can stop the

136
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,320
uh data transfer from the phone right i

137
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,919
mean if the data is being transferred

138
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,120
because when

139
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,240
this when your phone is hacked or if the

140
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,720
spyware is installed what it will do is

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
it will transfer the data from

142
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,479
uh from your phone to command and

143
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,039
control center right so what i suggested

144
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,759
just to you know at that moment i just

145
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,360
started to switch off the internet or

146
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
maybe even switch off the phone

147
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
until we get time to look at look into

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,199
that and that basically started my

149
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,600
curiosity you know everything

150
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,160
everything uh actually changed like how

151
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,720
i look at the things because and then i

152
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,759
started analyzing the different cases

153
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,960
of how the

154
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,120
famous people phone got hacked how the

155
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,960
journal is once getting

156
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,680
spy uh spied on and

157
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,759
most of the things about that

158
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,919
i then started

159
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,800
doing the case studies like i i started

160
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,520
uh

161
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,360
experiments on different spywares i

162
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,600
purchased couple of phones

163
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,520
and it was really shocking for me this

164
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,440
is a whole new industry active in the

165
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,840
market and somehow i was not

166
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,800
much

167
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
connected to that

168
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,360
and then i started looking at that uh

169
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,800
looking at those

170
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,600
spywares and today in today's talk i'm

171
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
going to present the ongoing research

172
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
it's not still that completed uh it's

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,240
still in the progress and it's based on

174
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,479
whatever things we found

175
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,840
and they were really uh i'm surprising

176
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,080
first i will quickly discuss about the

177
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,440
gif of

178
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,759
beijing's iphone was hacked right

179
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,919
it was a international espionage case

180
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,680
i'm sure most of you might have heard

181
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,560
that his phone was hacked he's

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,919
he got

183
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,000
even blackmailing emails and he has

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,840
explained he has basically described

185
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,520
this in the medium blog and everything

186
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,199
on the online okay

187
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,520
so if you see how the j business phone

188
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,400
was hacked it was not like uh one is it

189
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,039
and it was happened over the couple of

190
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,400
years so in 2017 it's based on the

191
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
uh again the news the initial case

192
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,639
studies i'm presenting based on the news

193
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,160
uh so in 2017 the saudi uh regime buys a

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,400
pegasus history uh it's a it's a spyware

195
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,639
and in 2018 uh jeff bezos was invited

196
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,319
for a dinner and the basically phone

197
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,000
numbers got exchanged

198
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,639
again in 2018 he got the for uh he got

199
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,880
the video on the whatsapp and from that

200
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,720
his phone was hacked

201
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,280
and in 2019 he basically announced that

202
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,639
he was getting he was being blackmailed

203
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,080
his private photo photos was uh with the

204
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,520
uh whoever has done the attacks right

205
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,800
so

206
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,000
uh i mean it's pegasus is it came into

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,919
news uh you can say uh recently or in in

208
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,759
specifically in india and many other

209
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,199
countries the countries it got

210
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,360
highlighted in

211
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
i would say one year or two year but

212
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,560
it's not the latest uh spyware it's it's

213
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,479
a bit old i mean it's uh

214
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,360
the news came uh the numbers which were

215
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,400
being spied on came into the uh news

216
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
recently but uh it's not really uh your

217
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,240
spyware okay so just like how it was

218
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,319
working i mean it was really one of the

219
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,799
sofi sophisticated one of the you can

220
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,799
say best of engineering

221
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,839
um uh on how this spyware was developed

222
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,360
basically if you understand which i'm

223
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,080
going to present the analysis on most of

224
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
the survivors which will uh which you'll

225
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,480
see that you need to basically you know

226
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,000
install that you need to change the

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,360
permissions

228
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
uh you need to do some tricks at least

229
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,959
you need some access

230
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,959
you need access for phone for at least a

231
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,720
couple of minutes in that case you can

232
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
make some changes and this private

233
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,560
stickers but in this case this was one

234
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,320
of you can say brilliant in terms of the

235
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
piece of code

236
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,200
if you

237
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
what it was it was a trident

238
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,200
vulnerabilities it was exploiting

239
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,720
but how it was working is very

240
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,800
interesting if you see an iphone or any

241
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,120
i mean android or iphone uh all the

242
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
applications

243
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,880
works in the sandboxing right what is

244
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
sandboxing is one application cannot

245
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,120
access the data of other application

246
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,000
unless uh explicitly explicit permission

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
has been granted right

248
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,800
but this pegasus was you know doing the

249
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
jailbreak uh jailbreak is like rooting

250
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,480
your phone

251
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,519
and

252
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,920
uh it was basically once you root your

253
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,279
phone it basically bypass all the

254
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,399
security

255
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,320
protections provided by apple or your

256
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,640
vendor and you can basically do anything

257
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,240
i mean you can check the messages and

258
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,959
whatsapp and whatnot

259
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,760
so

260
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,320
uh it was basically uh trident when it

261
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
used the trident for laboratories uh the

262
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
webkit memory correction kernel

263
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
information leak and kernel use after

264
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,079
free and this eventually lead to the you

265
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,839
know jailbreak of the phone and that was

266
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,839
with persistence uh access it was a

267
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,079
remote jailbreak okay

268
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,399
and ultimately it basically leads to the

269
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,920
routing of the phone i have just show

270
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,959
you a quick uh you know screenshot of

271
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,480
how the rooting actually looks like if

272
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,120
you see i have basically locked into

273
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,839
uh iphone uh with the root level access

274
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,320
and you can see almost uh everything

275
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,640
here all the files folders same like

276
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,120
linux or uh unique space operating

277
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
system

278
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,519
so i mean uh

279
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,079
it was very interesting

280
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,440
you might get one imessage sms whatsapp

281
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
you can click on some video and

282
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,680
ultimately it can do everything like it

283
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
can record your calls

284
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,560
um access your calendars contact book

285
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,519
gps location microphone emails

286
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,240
whatsapp chats everything i mean

287
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,920
it was uh i mean i will not uh discuss

288
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,560
more about the political agendas or how

289
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,480
the journalists phones were being hacked

290
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,120
or other things like uh

291
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,040
yeah so i will discuss more about the

292
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,519
technical things in this talk

293
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,240
so yeah once you uh

294
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
uh once you uh

295
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,560
based on the proof of concepts

296
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,959
once you uh click on the link

297
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,079
and

298
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,760
it was basically

299
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,240
giving access to all of your device it

300
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,440
was basically rooting your phone and

301
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,519
then giving access to everything

302
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,200
but there were also some zero click

303
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,120
attacks where you don't really have to

304
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,880
click on the link

305
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,360
uh again one of the very famous skype

306
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,240
free powerful android uh spyware it was

307
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,079
mostly uh in on the italian uh websites

308
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,360
okay these are again uh some of the uh

309
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,560
news uh from the news or snapshots

310
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,040
uh you can see that users

311
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,399
are told that they should update the

312
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,160
device configuration it was mostly on

313
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,800
the you know italian uh websites

314
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,440
and then it basically um

315
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,079
uh it can add itself to protected apps

316
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,600
list on the uh ui devices and

317
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,920
uh again it can do pretty much

318
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,839
everything okay it can again check your

319
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,880
wi-fi uh i mean it can track you your

320
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,279
locations whatsapp messages key logging

321
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,800
everything

322
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,440
uh and i have seen this industry has

323
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,480
grown

324
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,880
you can say exponentially from last

325
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,120
couple of years and since the pandemic

326
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,639
okay

327
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,240
and there are so many

328
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,040
so many vendors out there

329
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,880
which are having such products okay

330
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,680
so i wanted to start somewhere like uh

331
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,519
because this is definitely a different

332
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,480
line of uh research it's it's a huge

333
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,760
uh

334
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,079
huge list of spywares out there but but

335
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,000
i started with couple of spywares like

336
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,680
10 15.

337
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,760
most of them you have to purchase like

338
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,839
they have the premium so i basically

339
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,000
created lab and we had the couple of

340
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,959
phones

341
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,440
i also involved couple of my colleagues

342
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,279
to experiment this and we started

343
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,839
playing around this 5s

344
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,480
and what i'm going to show you uh of the

345
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,920
couple of uh the screenshots like uh

346
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,399
what exactly you can do i mean it was it

347
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,959
was not very costly the spirals which we

348
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,160
tested uh they were not very costly but

349
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
they've had a very uh you could say very

350
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,959
powerful in terms of uses

351
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,639
and

352
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,560
we also tested on different antivirus

353
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,440
software uh like play protect or we

354
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,720
installed a couple of antivirus

355
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560
softwares and we also checked that how

356
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,639
many antivirus were basically able to

357
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,959
detect detect this firewall

358
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,160
and

359
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,440
uh

360
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,120
again the results were surprising not

361
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
all antivirus uh able to

362
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,560
virus softwares or the play protect you

363
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
were able to detect all the

364
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,360
uh spywares okay and i have in the end

365
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,560
of this talk i will also uh discuss it

366
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,360
like comparison okay like uh

367
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,240
what is the statistics and all

368
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,199
so you can see uh as as i said in the uh

369
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,880
in the initial time of the talk we will

370
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,680
not talk about the vendors we will just

371
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,000
refer them as spyware one two three like

372
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,519
in that way

373
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,600
uh you can see uh one of the spyware was

374
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,040
very interesting it was showing the

375
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,600
wi-fi on right i'm sure that the

376
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,360
non-techie or even those who use

377
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,160
day-to-day you uh you know uh

378
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
day-to-day use they use this phone

379
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,240
for calling or messaging they can easily

380
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,800
click on this icon okay this just shows

381
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,079
a wi-fi

382
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,040
uh and once you click on that all those

383
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,600
basically you know all these spywares

384
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,519
are a very sophisticated client and

385
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,959
server so

386
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,720
from the server side or command and

387
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,600
control uh server we we are able to see

388
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,440
everything like

389
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,839
the phone calls the messages this is the

390
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,920
dashboard or from the spyware like uh

391
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,839
the gps locations

392
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,440
uh call recordings uh social media

393
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,720
right

394
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,120
and you can see everything like imei

395
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,079
number device model hardware id

396
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,320
uh it's all about controlling the phone

397
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,160
uh from remotely

398
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,720
so you can see the top calling numbers

399
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,079
uh

400
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,079
in in like top 10 calling numbers then

401
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,519
which are the numbers they have called

402
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,399
on

403
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,199
uh all the messages you know i i many

404
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,920
times get so many calls like i work in

405
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,639
like mobile security industry that

406
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,440
uh

407
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,160
their bank account got hacked or i mean

408
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
the bank the money got stolen and stuff

409
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,079
like that and they said they had the otp

410
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,120
yes because if your phone is infected

411
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,519
with the spyware right

412
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,519
even if you are getting the otp's

413
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,600
two-factor authentication it can still

414
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
give get those otps right

415
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,000
so all the locations you can just track

416
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,279
the uh locations of that particular user

417
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,600
uh you can insert find that coordinates

418
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,279
where exactly that person is you can

419
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,199
record all the calls

420
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,440
on on beyond behalf of that person

421
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,839
and what not you can enable the camera

422
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,920
silently you can check the whatsapp

423
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,759
messages

424
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,399
everything instagram messages okay

425
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,880
so it was not just for one spyware and

426
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,199
couple of i mean i'm just not i'm not

427
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,519
going to show you the 50s 5s in the

428
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,120
stock but i'm going to show you two or

429
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,600
three but more or like they have you

430
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,920
know one of the way is like how to get

431
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,560
infect how to infect the target phone

432
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,000
and

433
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,839
and they had some different different

434
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,759
ways and techniques to interfere

435
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,120
but once it infect more or less

436
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,880
most of the spywares had the you know

437
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,920
similar uh dashboards like to control

438
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
those devices

439
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,320
uh again one of the this was android

440
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,839
auto name and you can see the call

441
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,320
frequency uh like uh everything like

442
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,759
records around remote control

443
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,120
call history

444
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,360
text message logs right

445
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,759
uh whatsapp messages

446
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,600
everything i mean the calendar also like

447
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,679
what are the different meetings um and i

448
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,319
i'm sure that this is could be

449
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,280
uh

450
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
one of the way of industrial espionage

451
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,359
uh on checking things on the uh your

452
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,760
opponents

453
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,319
conversion threads uh apps installed on

454
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,799
the device we can also uninstall those

455
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,559
apps for example if some antivirus

456
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,640
softwares are installed uh we can

457
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,240
actually also

458
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,120
uh uninstall those apps screen time

459
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,280
right so basically we can

460
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,760
study everything about that person

461
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,320
without knowing uh

462
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,480
then how how it's happening

463
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,320
if you see in case of iphone if the

464
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,799
phone is rooted in in syria there are

465
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,039
hooks like if you can go to the once

466
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,720
your phone is jailbroken you have the

467
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,600
syria and then you can install the hooks

468
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,679
again in that hooks using hooks also you

469
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,520
can check what is that application is

470
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,760
doing i mean we can easily

471
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,360
use those hooks and attach to the

472
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,200
applications and then also we can check

473
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,160
the application activity in the uh ios

474
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,039
of

475
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,440
our iphones

476
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,280
uh the photo gallery

477
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,480
of course you can download all the

478
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,240
photos you can clean the photos from the

479
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,320
target system uh you can keep the

480
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,240
passcode so i mean we found very very

481
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,160
creative ways um

482
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,000
on how this uh

483
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,440
this fibers uh are designed okay

484
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,840
and again the keylogger also you can do

485
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,120
you can also type the message on

486
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,280
someone's behalf you can record almost

487
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,200
all the calls right

488
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,679
uh you can record the surrounding

489
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,440
and you can also export the data you can

490
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,400
import it so some other device right

491
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
i mean pretty much

492
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
you can do everything and you know how

493
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,480
much it costs like if you see the cost

494
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,840
of this

495
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,039
these

496
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,600
these softwares or spywares i would say

497
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,679
this is really really nice i mean anyone

498
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,039
can just

499
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,640
go and

500
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,160
use this and it's it's really scary

501
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,120
um

502
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,799
yeah again

503
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,679
one of the uh one of these spiders also

504
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,799
right

505
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,919
i mean similar dashboards to have them

506
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,039
uh

507
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,799
all the messages and many of these

508
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,280
fibers you know what they advertise

509
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,600
themselves as they are the

510
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,720
uh the child monitoring softwares or

511
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
something like you know it it can help

512
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,400
you to protect trail but i didn't see

513
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,960
that it actually verifies that

514
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,360
i mean

515
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,520
nobody checks that if you're using for

516
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
child or if you're using for

517
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,679
some espionage

518
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,919
purpose right

519
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,799
and yeah you can of course uh download

520
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,640
the photos uh

521
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,880
most of the subscribers also give the

522
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,080
messages or from instagram tinder

523
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,120
uh facebook twitter i mean they have the

524
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,320
access to

525
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,960
almost all the apps on the phone and i

526
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,200
just as i said come on control you can

527
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,880
turn on the bluetooth you can turn on

528
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,760
the location you can turn off the wi-fi

529
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,840
uh keel recorder

530
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,320
uh i mean what not

531
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,799
so and this is a comparison okay uh we

532
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,000
checked with many antivirus softwares uh

533
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,640
i mean um and we checked it's as i said

534
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,120
the research is still in the progress um

535
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,280
uh you can say just uh

536
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,799
some of the part uh which is about uh to

537
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,640
happen and many of the spyware doesn't

538
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,200
require root access because they use uh

539
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,120
exclusive access permissions on the

540
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,000
phone but it just you need a

541
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
couple of minutes and couple of

542
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,880
survivors were smart enough they were

543
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,799
they exploited a couple of zero-day

544
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,200
vulnerabilities to get them into the

545
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,440
approved list of the apps right

546
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,960
uh as you can see uh i i just presented

547
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,080
the uh comparison of five spywares and

548
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,320
you can say that

549
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,360
uh as of now whatever i checked on it's

550
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,480
mostly uh for the android and for

551
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,200
research for the ios is also in progress

552
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,600
and you can see that couple of uh

553
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,440
antivirus we are not able to reject

554
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,159
certain piece of uh

555
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,200
piece of

556
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,159
these

557
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,440
spywares

558
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,440
uh there are also other servers which

559
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,080
i'm working on which are completely

560
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,919
you can say um

561
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,159
i mean they were launched

562
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,240
they would they were not detected by

563
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,039
most of these five antivirus softwares

564
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,880
uh which are available for the phones

565
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,559
okay

566
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,559
which i might present in the upcoming

567
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,360
talks so yeah that was i mean uh that

568
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,200
that is bit uh

569
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,840
uh you can say this is one of the uh

570
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,679
very growing industry

571
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,760
and a bit lost so they are making lots

572
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,320
of easy to infect mostly they advertise

573
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,559
themselves as a child monitoring but

574
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,960
nobody cares if you are using it for

575
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,120
child and if you're using for you know

576
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
for uh spirit purpose

577
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,640
uh right

578
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,960
so yeah these were the uh references for

579
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,320
my talk i think yeah almost uh

580
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,640
done with the uh timing so these are the

581
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,880
references uh citizen lab uh this sort

582
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,960
of canada is uh they are doing a lot of

583
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,000
research

584
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,919
in this mostly uh

585
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,039
with the

586
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,520
journalists like the phones whose

587
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,919
generalist phones which are being hacked

588
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:14,799
or

589
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,159
even into the uh the politicians right

590
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:18,880
so

591
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
they have very good resources and these

592
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,080
are the a couple of resources i used

593
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,440
uh thank you for uh everyone for uh

606
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,799
well

607
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,559
yes let's give people a couple of

608
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,640
minutes thanks swarov let's give them a

609
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,080
couple of minutes

610
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,679
uh if you want to come up with some

611
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,400
questions um i just have one

612
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,799
curiosity when you show the dashboards

613
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,799
like of the spywares were you trying to

614
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,120
spywares like on your mobile like on

615
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,320
your network or this is something

616
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,039
outside from some you know lab in the

617
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,440
internet or something

618
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,159
no so basically we uh i have purchased

619
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,840
like three four phones like the brand

620
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,000
new phones and we have created this lab

621
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,240
i have given this to my phone and we are

622
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,440
to my friends

623
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,600
and we are basically experimenting this

624
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,320
like

625
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,480
it's all the i mean we're not trying on

626
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,919
the people but

627
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,919
uh it's all the brand new phones we are

628
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,520
acting that we are a normal people who

629
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,840
clicks on the whatsapp youtube links and

630
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,320
stuff like that yeah that's cool that's

631
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,360
cool

632
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,679
yeah so yeah i don't see there is any

633
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,200
questions so far

634
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
so if you have any question if you want

635
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,360
perhaps you know later you can write in

636
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,840
the channel the second familiar slack

637
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,320
channel and you know i'm sure screw up

638
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,720
and he will be there to answer

639
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,240
so again thank you very much again
