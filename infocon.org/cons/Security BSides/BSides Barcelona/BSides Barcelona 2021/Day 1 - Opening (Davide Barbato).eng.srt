00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,640
before before talking about uh today's

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,840
um

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,439
this year's edition let's have a little

21
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,000
bit a look of what this ideas and its

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,439
history

23
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,360
for uh

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,439
for the ones of you would don't know

25
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,400
about security design that has been that

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,280
was it is actually a

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,240
framework for creating events that

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,119
actually have been mostly used to create

29
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,960
security conferences

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,200
uh and you know that basically it's a

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,119
framework for local communities of

32
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,560
security cybersecurity enthusiasts to

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,680
um

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,159
to build and run these events and the

35
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,720
goal is to create um

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,520
these kind of like an intimate um

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,600
familiar atmosphere that foster

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
collaboration and where you know the

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,000
conversation or for the next big thing

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,040
happened

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,600
and and specifically you know what the

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,000
community needs and you know what's

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,960
trending about cyber security um

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,719
in in the industry and in the local

45
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,560
communities as well

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,560
it all started in 2011 and 2009

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,318
when several

48
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,480
speakers didn't uh get um into the black

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,319
i didn't get accepted black card in las

50
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,560
vegas back then because they weren't

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,760
basically

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
slots available

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,760
for them and therefore they decided to

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,879
create like a parallel side

55
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,840
conference which is now called besides

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,160
las vegas

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,200
the history behind besides barcelona

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,440
it's uh it's a little bit different uh

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,200
we also start as a spin-off of uh the

60
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,000
local barcelona cyber security community

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,200
um i think it's been like four years

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,319
kind of more or less uh and so we we did

63
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,720
several talks workshops you know beers

64
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,040
we gathered around the city and in the

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,760
community was you know quite engaged and

66
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,560
and and committed to keep going and and

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,959
you know create contents and so we

68
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,040
decided to uh

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,319
you know build uh a security conference

70
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,040
we had a chat with few with some of the

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,159
original founders of beside and you know

72
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,480
they gave us the idea to you know create

73
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,560
the conference as a beside one using

74
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,319
that framework and we did so in 2019

75
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,120
when we had our first

76
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
edition it was in person here in

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
barcelona and it featured

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
one day it was just one day the whole

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,879
day it was one track there were nine

80
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,879
speakers and 280 participants including

81
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,120
volunteers uh you know organizers

82
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,400
sponsored attendees

83
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,560
these are the people who made this

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,680
possible uh again they uh worked

85
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,000
trendlessly in the past a few months to

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,959
make sure that this edition was uh as

87
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,840
rich and threatening as possible um so

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
big shout out to them they made an

89
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,439
incredible job

90
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,159
and you can find them in slack with the

91
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,200
you know the beside little page next to

92
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,760
their name

93

114
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,440
communication um we have a channel for

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,240
each track and then we have the general

116
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,280
and the hallway channels um we're gonna

117
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,720
use for that if you need to reach out

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
directly to us uh to the volunteers if

119
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,960
