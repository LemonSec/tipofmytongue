that's been an incredible effort you

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,960
know to make this happen it's been

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,318
challenging for us as well you know this

50
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,080
was a virtual conference that we never

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,560
done before so we came you know from the

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,920
experience of doing an on-site

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,560
conference or i mean there is you know

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,160
different challenges that you have to

55
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,840
address right you know what they need to

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,760
say yeah it's a completely different

57
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,920
conference so we try to make it close

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,680
you know to you uh that's why you know

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,599
we came with the other swag

60
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,840
i think you know the um the the virtual

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,680
experience right it might not be exactly

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
the same as an on-site one so that's

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,360
something to keep in mind right um

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,440
well you know i'm gonna take the time to

65
