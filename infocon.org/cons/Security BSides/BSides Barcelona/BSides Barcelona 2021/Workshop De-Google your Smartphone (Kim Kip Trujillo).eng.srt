00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,399
smartphone since january of 20 that's

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,079

or is it january 2020 2021 yeah i've

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,480
been

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,719
living with it for a long time oh i just

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,719
got so i'm in a public space i have to

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,160
wear this they're making me wear it

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,000
well

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,680
okay so i look like this now

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,320
so um

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,400
i have quite a bit of experience living

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,720
with my d google smartphone

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,479
so

33
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,000
yeah

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,680
uh yeah i even wrote a blog post about

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
it it's linked right here i'll share it

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
with you all at the very end if you want

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,520
to see the slides or pdf of the slides

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,479
uh is a google's life viable

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,880
i argue it is

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,159
though you will have to

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,360
accept

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,280
a few trade-offs

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,600
because the world we live in today

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,399
is geared towards

45
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,560
the assumption that you have a google

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,840
smartphone

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,560
so to give you an example i

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,000
bought a package from amazon just two

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,240
days ago

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
and

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,439
i chose an amazon locker to pick it up

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,759
and my assumption my fullest assumption

53
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,320
was that they would email me a qr code

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,399
or something to unlock

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,598
the locker

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,120
but no they integrated with a google api

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
to disclose my location

58
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,000
and my bluetooth hardware so that way it

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,720
could pair to the locker to unlock it

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,120
so when i took my degree phone to unlock

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
the locker it didn't work right like

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,239
that

63
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,680
amazingly

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,560
like challenging feature to achieve like

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,879
it's amazon they make it available

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,959
for everyone but if you have a degoogled

67
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,840
phone some very specific features like

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,800
that

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,920
you're gonna have to learn to live

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,840
without which is fine i meant it i got

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,200
my package

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,519
uh i used another phone to do it i

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,959
cheated

74
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,280
but um i do live with this phone every

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,640
day so it's very viable indeed in my

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,120
opinion

77
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,360
so

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
i gotta warn you now

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,360
not every phone

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
is supported

81
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,959
okay

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,599
on the lineage os website

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,319
they have a long list of devices that

84
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,680
they're willing to release software for

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,319
and unless your phone is on that list

86
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,200
your life is going to be

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,879
um your life is going to be hard with

88
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,560
what i'm saying is if your phone isn't

89
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
on that list if it is on that list it's

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
pretty it's pretty seamless you just

91
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,440
follow the instructions

92
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,319
so

93
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,159
with that i gotta warn you again not

94
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,239
every phone is unlocked

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,480
carriers when i say carriers i mean

96
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
cellular carriers like

97
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,239
verizon at t at least in america here we

98
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,319
have vodafone and a company called

99
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,440
orange which is pretty neat

100
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,799
um they

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,879
regulate

102
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,200
um what you can and cannot do with your

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,439
phone and so do the carriers that sell

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,040
the phones

105
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,120
and carriers have a rationale they want

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,439
to make sure that you fully paid off

107
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,000
your device

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
before

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
you are allowed to

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
um do things with it because they don't

111
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,920
want you like jumping carriers like you

112
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,720
know finance a phone and then just leave

113
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,760
so

114
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,560
you gotta unlock the bootloader

115
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,959
and um finally if you are following

116
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
along i'm not seeing if there is anyone

117
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
following along or not but you gotta

118
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
remember to back up your phone because

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,320
we are reinstalling firmware today

120
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,479
so it's going to erase

121
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,639
absolutely everything it's you're

122
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,160
starting clean slate and that's what

123
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,840
this is all about

124
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,320
we're not de-googling

125
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,360
by just removing google software it's

126
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,840
well beyond that now it's too difficult

127
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,000
to just do it piecemeal

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,840
lineage os started from the ground up

129
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,600
they took

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,479
um

131
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,479
android

132
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,759
which by the way

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,919
android um

134
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,520
if the goal here today is de-googling

135
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
we've already kind of failed a little

136
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,759
bit

137
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,120
because it is android and android is uh

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,360
was originally published by google but

139
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
we're kind of glossing over that because

140
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
the real thing that offends us the real

141
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,440
privacy invasive thing is all the

142
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,560
supporting services that are installed

143
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,960
on top of android

144
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,680
so android by itself is

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,600
is very lightweight and very

146
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
non-intrusive

147
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,479
but the google services are not so much

148
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,919
and actually

149
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,039
oh yeah i forgot to add the outline

150
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,960
oh well

151
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,039
so what is lineage os i just got into

152
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,000
this

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,639
um it's very easy to do google is what

154
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,199
it is in a nutshell um you follow the

155
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,479
instructions

156
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,280
and you get regular updates very fast

157
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
updates

158
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
um a lot faster than any carrier i've

159
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,759
ever had it's almost weekly

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,520
so

161
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,919
yeah and what you're giving up is this

162
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,919
right here the google

163
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,919
mobile services and i'm going to go

164
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,759
ahead and just click that just to see

165
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,160
just to show you so the google mobile

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
services

167
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,400
are all these apps so gmail google maps

168
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,039
youtube google drive google play you

169
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,199
won't have

170
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,880
an app store

171
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,560
right away i'll show you how to install

172
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,520
an app store it'll be fine

173
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,199
but that's what you're giving up when

174
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,039
you install lineage os like all these

175
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,440
apps don't come pre-installed

176
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,800
and that's a good thing in my opinion

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,039
oh so

178
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,440
oh yeah so lineage os is actually based

179
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
on something called cyanogenmod which

180
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
went under

181
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
uh several years back it's the same

182
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,160
thing it's just renamed it's a fork of

183
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,080
that project

184
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,319
so i'm gonna try to get back into here i

185
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,720
accidentally foolishly exited out of my

186
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,400
presenters mode

187
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,160
so i'm gonna go ahead and represent that

188
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,250
there we go

189
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,280
[Music]

190
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,319
all right

191
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,560
warnings what you're signing up for when

192
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,960
you unlock the bootloader

193
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,440
you're going to get a bootloader warning

194
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,759
it's kind of scary looking

195
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,800
relax what this means is

196
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,319
is that google can no longer guarantee

197
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,919
the software that's installed on the

198
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:24,800
phone

199
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,360
is the same as as they shipped it to you

200
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,120
this is actually a security feature this

201
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,880
isn't google trying to control your life

202
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,479
this is actually that bootloader warning

203
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,039
is kind of a good thing because they're

204
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,120
preventing people from manipulating

205
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
android and giving you something with

206
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
spyware on it

207
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,040
so

208
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,880
[Music]

209
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,479
google can no longer guarantee the

210
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,919
software on the phone

211
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,720
but you can because you changed it you

212
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,400
installed it so when you get this

213
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,479
warning you can kind of be proud of it

214
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,879
like you know i did that

215
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,000
and finally um what i mentioned earlier

216
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,759
not all apps will work get used to

217
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,960
seeing this message for a lot of apps

218
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
uh it won't run without google play

219
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,639
services which you can try to install

220
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,039
there are communities of people

221
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,120
that try to get google play services

222
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,400
working

223
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,280
on lineage os

224
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
it's kind of hit or miss and i don't

225
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,639
recommend it but it is something you can

226
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,400
do

227
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,759
so these are the tools you're going to

228
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,720
need you need a computer any computer

229
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,039
running any operating system

230
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,599
you need a usb cable to connect the

231
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,680
phone to the computer

232
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,479
and you need the phone

233
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,159
all right

234
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,640
you're gonna need to know a little bit

235
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
just a little bit

236
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,279
of command line

237
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,839
so really quickly here

238
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,800
uh

239
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,760
let's see if i can grab one

240
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,279
i'm going to open up a terminal i'm

241
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,839
going to bring it up

242
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,440
there see if we can see this and

243
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,200
the commands at the same time

244
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,959
oh zoom in

245
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,680
there we go it's a little bigger

246
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,279
a little bigger a little better so this

247
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,880
is the terminal this is what it looks

248
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,640
like i'm sure you heard of it we don't

249
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
see your terminal we're only seeing your

250
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,320
browser

251
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,480
really okay

252
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,399
excuse me thank you for pointing that

253
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,200
out i'm going to start a new share

254
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,920
and i'm going to share the whole desktop

255
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,880
this time like a good presenter

256
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,000
yes how's that it should be snapping in

257
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,240
where you can see yay

258
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,440
thank you

259
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,839
excellent so this is the terminal

260
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,560
uh so you're gonna need to know uh the

261
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,480
cd command

262
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
and actually the ls command is kind of

263
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,560
helpful which stands for list your

264
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,279
listing directories

265
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,839
uh and

266
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,240
with that you can use cd to change into

267
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,000
a directory so i'm going to pick

268
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,480
the steam directory

269
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,320
and now i'm in the steam directory yay

270
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
and i can list that and it has stuff in

271
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,279
it

272
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,519
if the terminal is cluttered i like to

273
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,279
recommend a clear command clear

274
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,040
and that just makes it

275
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
nice looking you know so if you're like

276
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
lost in all the texts like you can type

277
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,720
that command and everything's kind of

278
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,880
okay again

279
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,800
and finally

280
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,040
the tab completion is going to be very

281
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,800
important because it's going to save you

282
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
a lot of typing because some of these

283
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,560
downloads that you're handling are quite

284
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
long in the name

285
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,519
so

286
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,760
if you for example type l and you hit

287
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,040
tab

288
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,480
it's supposed to um whoa

289
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,920
uh ls

290
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,279
and then l yeah it completes names for

291
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,200
you so you just hit tab and it completes

292
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,360
names that's all it does

293
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,399
so

294
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,160
don't worry too much about this we'll

295
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,839
i'll point out when you can use it when

296
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,440
it's time to use it

297
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
if you're following along i haven't

298
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,200
actually seen anyone post if they're

299
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,560
actually following along with a phone

300
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,640
today so i might just be

301
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
de-googling the phone live

302
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,120
and not stopping for people to catch up

303
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
so

304
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,240
if you have a phone tell me now

305
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,800
otherwise i'm going to go a little fast

306
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,160
so

307
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,839
with

308
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,680
that but i'm gonna hide that away

309
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,760
excellent

310
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,720
and i'm going to present

311
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,079
uh

312
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,120
five

313
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,040
what that does

314
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,839
this is due oh

315
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,520
god that's not what that does at all

316
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,669
[Music]

317
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,640
what is this

318
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,040
i don't want that

319
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,240
all right

320
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
so

321
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,560
these are the tools that you have to

322
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,079
install

323
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,760
you can download them from here they

324
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,519
have different directories for different

325
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,560
types

326
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,200
i am on linux today so i'm going to be

327
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,079
downloading this tool right here

328
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,760
you can see here this is what it looks

329
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,440
like when you're actually running the

330
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,279
tools

331
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,079
um

332
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,639
and finally we're going to cheat today

333
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,639
instead of actually fully installing

334
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,839
them

335
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,279
we're just going to run them right from

336
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,600
the folder because they do work

337
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
without actually installing them you

338
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,720
just download them and run them

339
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,200
the instructions here actually get into

340
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,720
like how to install them in your system

341
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,639
but it's very developer oriented so we

342
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,360
just kind of skip that

343
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,800
so i'm going to go ahead and download

346
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,399
desktop under a new folder titled

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
and

352
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,839
i'm going to go and go to that folder

353
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,600
i'm going to unzip

354
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,920
that little guy

355
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,360
cool

356
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,760
and now i'm going to go ahead

357
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,880
and start using those tools

358
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,240
so if you had a phone and you're going

359
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,680
to follow along

360
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
this is what i would have you do

361
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,399
i would have you go to the wiki

362
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,360
and check to see if your phone

363
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
is supported this is where you go for

364
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,120
that

365
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,880
so

366
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,399
yeah if you want to do it go ahead give

367
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,120
it a shot wiki.lineageos.org

[Music]

369
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
and um

370
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,120
i'm going to give people a chance to do

371
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,160
that and i am going to get into

372
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,240
that tools directory and i'm going to do

373
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,880
that by changing directory to home

374
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,720
but you can use the little tilde thing

375
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,040
or you can just type cd but i'm going to

376
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,560
go home then a cd into my desktop

377
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,120
android folder i just use tab completion

378
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,320
there

379
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,839
i'm going to list that folder i'm going

380
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,360
to cd into

381
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
platform tools i'm going to do that by

382
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,440
typing p and then tab

383
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,040
enter

384
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,600
i'm going to list that directory

385
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,199
and it has

386
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,560
a platform tools folder it's very deep

387
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,560
i don't know why they did that

388
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,600
so cd change directory into platform

389
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,480
tools very nice and this is looking

390
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,760
cluttered so i'm going to clear

391
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,010
[Music]

392
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,360
and i'm going to see what's in this

393
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
directory right now

394
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,680
there's a bunch of stuff

395
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,279
i don't know what all this stuff does

396
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,839
but that's okay you don't have to know

397
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,959
what you need to do is type the adb

398
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,800
command

399
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,320
and you're going to dot slash so we're

400
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
going to run it

401
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,399
and then a d b

402
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,079
and i'm going to hit enter and look at

403
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,519
that it ran it put out a bunch of

404
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,839
garbage onto the screen that is cool

405
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,320
so now i'm gonna do adb

406
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,040
don't forget the dot slash adb

407
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,800
list

408
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,800
devices

409
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,279
oh is it devices list

410
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,880
it's one of them yeah there we go

411
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,800
and it came back blank so i'm going to

412
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,560
clear and run that again

413
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,720
i'm going to hit the up arrow

414
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,199
then i'm going to do adb devices

415
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,399
and it's showing no devices are attached

416
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,360
so

417
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,720
i'll attach a device and i'm going to

418
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,079
change your view so you're no longer

419
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,199
going to see me so i'm going to wave

420
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,399
goodbye

421
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,760
and i'm going to move the webcam can you

422
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,400
all see my webcam by the way

423

[Music]

424
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,639
it's going to be important

425
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,000
um i do see you yes but it looks like

426
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,839
people can put that uh

427
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,680
wherever they want so yes i think

428
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,120
everyone alright

429
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,680
so if you can see my webcam um i'm gonna

430
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,519
turn it off for just a second because

431
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,199
it's gonna get kinda i'm gonna move it

[Music]

433
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,279
okay

434
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,440
starting the video again

435
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,560
this time you see my tabletop and you

436
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,160
see my phone i hope i can't see my phone

437
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,639
i don't know how to see it but i'm

438
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,120
assuming you can

439
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,199
yes we see in the

440
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,560
different screen

441
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
excellent

442
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,320
so i'm going to go ahead and plug it in

443
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
to plug into the computer

444
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
i'm going to unlock it with my super

445
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,720
fancy fingerprint

446
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,360
and yeah it's connected

447
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,600
so in order to get adb to see the phone

448
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,440
you have to enable

449
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,320
um

450
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,800
usb debugging and in order to enable usb

451
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,560
debugging you have to enable developer

452
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,759
mode

453
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,560
it's going to be down here in

454
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,519
i believe about phone

455
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,920
if you tap on the

456
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,320
build number

457
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,759
several times

458
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,360
you'd have to tap it seven times and

459
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
once you do that

460
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,480
it enables developer mode

461
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,639
okay so one person

462
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,120
oh it's christian has an old xiaomi me

463

that's cool well give it a shot let me

465
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,720

466
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,839
so yeah build number unlock android

467
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,240
developer tools android developer tools

468
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,880
live in a system at least on my phone it

469
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,000

[Music]

476
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,400
until i see something that says usb on

477
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,919
it

478
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,000
and i'm going to enable it

479
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
yup

480
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,039
i'm going to get that warning

481
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,880
intended for development purposes only

482
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,520
you gotta get it gotta just hit okay

483
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,280
cool and right away

484
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,919
i know it's working because

485
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,799
i just got an rsa key

486
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,600
this is my computer requesting control

487
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,440
over my phone right now

488
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,200
i actually like to leave that box

489
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,600
unchecked because of this

490
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,679
because i like to get the confirmation

491
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,360
first the permission asking it's always

492
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,840
good when i ask permission right

493
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,480
and second and more importantly it gives

494
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,240
me some kind of visual cue that it's

495
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,919
actually gonna connect

496
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,000
so i hit allow here

497
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,280
and now i go back to my computer

498
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,000
and i go into that terminal the up arrow

499
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,960
and i list adb devices oh my god a

500
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
device is connected

501
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
amazing

502
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,720
so

503
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,240
now we've gotten this far i'm going to

504
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,720
go ahead and open the guide

505

go over there it is the oneplus 6t

507
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,520
they call it the fajita

508
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
which is cool

509
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,799
and this page has a lot of things in it

510
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,039

be the installation guide

512
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,919
yes

513
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,520
so

514
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,679
now you have the installation guide and

515
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,440
actually by the way that page has some

516
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,760
special boot modes and things

517
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,120
um

518
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,440
so just some key combinations you

519
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,039
generally won't need these but it's kind

520
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,640
of nice to have it tells you how to take

521
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,960
control over your phone

522
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,720
uh so we're going to go to the

523
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,440
installation guide

524
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,360
and

525
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,039
we are going to read these instructions

526
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,039
i've already read them and if you were

527
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,880
following along i would actually pause

528
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,400
for five minutes and i would make you

529
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,600
read them

530
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
because if you skip any of these

531
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,440
instructions it's you're gonna have a

532
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,120
bad time

533
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,320
um

534
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,799
so read them

535
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,880
so make sure your computer is adb and

536
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
fastboot

537
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,600
that's gonna that's one we already did

538
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
because i just downloaded the tools here

539
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,760
so that's fine

540
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,360
and yeah here here's the thing that

541
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,039
tells you to read them at least once

542
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,799
before actually following them to avoid

543
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,000
any problems due to any missed steps

544
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,240
this big red box here make sure it's

545
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,000
running android 11 so i'm going to go

546
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
back to my phone and i'm going to look

547
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,799
at it

548
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,080
and i'm going to see is it android

549
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,120
version

550
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,679
android version 11. i am fine

551
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,039
i am ready for this and you'll see it's

552
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,480
already lineage os that's how i know

553
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,600
this is going to go well today because

554
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,440
i've already googled this phone once

555
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,000
so

556
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
[Music]

557
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,440
make sure it's on android 11 firmware it

558
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,940
is on android 11.

559
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,320
[Music]

560
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,840
we're going to unlock the bootloader

561
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,559
so

562
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,880
you take this command and because we are

563
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,120
cheating we are cheating with adb you

564
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,280
have to type dot slash

565
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,480
adb

566
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,159
so remember that

567
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,400
because i didn't install it i have to be

568
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,880
in the directory where it is so if i

569
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,480
list

570
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,120
you'll actually see the command adb in

571
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,200
there it's a file

572
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,320
it's an executable file

573
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,280
so dot slash adb

574
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,480
space reboot space bootloader

575
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,280
and if you watch my screen on the phone

576
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,880
you watch the phone as soon as i hit

577
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,640
enter this phone's going to reboot into

578
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,840
the bootloader

579
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,520
oh my god

580
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,840
what just

581
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,039
i already told you what happened you

582
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,250
should know

583
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,840
[Music]

584
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,360
there it goes

585
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,840
fastboot mode

586
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,550
cool

587
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,799
[Music]

588
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,840
now

589
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
we're going to make sure that we still

590
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,039
have control over this phone right now

591
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,679
and we can't use adb to do it

592
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,720
we have to use fastboot command

593
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,679
so

594
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,440
i'm going to type the command that they

595
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
tell me to

596
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,400
we can skip this step because we're

597
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,960
already there we're already in fastboot

598
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,420
mode

599
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,799
[Music]

600
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,919
we're gonna run this command by typing

601
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,760
dot slash because we didn't install it

602
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,679
we're just running it

603
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,240
fast and i can just tab complete that

604
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,760
pass boot devices

605
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,200
and look at that

606
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,919
it's detected if it weren't detected

607
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,039
you wouldn't see that um

608
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,799
that string right there

609
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,640
so and actually i can disconnect it

610
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,360
right now i can unplug it from the phone

611
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,760
and you'll see that it disappears

612
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,240
but when you plug it back in

613
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,840
it's immediate

614
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,679
you get it back so

615
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,320
don't be afraid

616
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,120
all right and finally the command that

617
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,400
they're telling us to run next

618
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,080
is going to be

619
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,760
dot slash fast boot

620
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,240
oem

621
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,039
unlock and this is the place where i

622
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,880
anticipate a lot of you are going to get

623
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,240
stuck on

624
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,840
because each cell phone provider

625
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,919
has a different way of unlocking the

626
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,840
phone

627
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,840
when it comes to actually providing the

628
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,919
key to the phone it's usually the same

629
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,760
they send you like a string

630
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,559
that you have to type into this terminal

631
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,080
you know you have to do like a special

632
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,360
key

633
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,080
and um you type it and it unlocks it but

634
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,480
you can only get this key from the

635
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,320
people that sold you the phone assuming

636
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,080
it's unlocked assuming it's locked if

637
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,840
you bought an unlocked phone

638
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,280
then you don't really have to worry

639
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,600
about this but this is a command to use

640
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,520
to unlock the phone

641
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,360
and as you can see here

642
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,400
i bought an unlocked phone

643
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,559
so the task failed but it failed

644
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,240
successfully

645
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,080
failed remote device already unlocked

646
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,559
hooray

647
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,120
so if the device doesn't automatically

648
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,799
reboot reboot it it should now be

649
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,000
unlocked

650
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,640
so i would reboot it but um

651
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,720
it's already unlocked

652
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,830
so

653
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,120
[Music]

654
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
we're going to download the custom

655
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,799
recovery

656
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,200
i'm going to do that from lineage

657
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,960
recovery i'm just going to click the

658
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,799
things that give me i'm not like going

659
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,960
anywhere special it says download a

660
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,880
custom recovery you can download it from

661
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,480
this right here click it

662
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,679
and you'll see this menu here

663
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,440
this menu is kind of confusing in my

664
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,720
opinion so i'd recommend paying

665
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,799
attention to this next bit

666
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,159
um these ones on the left are actual

667
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,640
full operating systems

668
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,200
these ones on the right are the recovery

669
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,799
images

670
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,840
the ones on the top are the newest

671
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,080
and you want the newest

672
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,279
so

673
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,960
click the one on the right that's on the

674
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,279
top

675
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,440
we're going to save this file in the

676
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,279
android folder

677
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,880
i'm going to go to the desktop where i

678
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,760
saved it and i'm going to go all the way

679
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,640
into that directory

680
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,400
platform tools

681
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,600
and yeah this is where i'm going to

682
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,799
leave it

683
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,760
so you'll notice i select that directory

684
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,600
because that's where i am in the

685
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,880
terminal

686
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,039
so i want this path

687
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,279
to be the same as this path

688
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,880
which it is

689
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,000
so

690
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,919
i'm going to leave that name alone

691
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,840
and i'm going to hit save in this

692
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,600
directory which is the same as this

693
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,158
directory

694
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,520
and it's going to take a little bit of

695
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,440
time we're going to wait until that

696
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,890
downloads

697
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,079
[Music]

698
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,880
and actually while i'm at it i'm gonna

699
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,360
go ahead and kick off the

700
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,200
the download for this one once this one

701
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,799
finishes because it's kind of big so if

702
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,039
you have slow internet at home

703
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,039
i recommend starting this download as

704
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,360
well as soon as possible

705
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,600
um it's not too big it's only 500 megs

706
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,760
but in my particular scenario i'm going

707
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,039
to do it now because my connection is

708
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,279
kind of slow

709
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,559
so

710
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,760
yeah

711
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,360
and we can even check on that download

712
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,880
to make sure the directories are the

713
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,559
same by going into the terminal just

714
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,080
typing ls

715
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,679
i should see

716
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,200
some files

717
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,799
appearing here so i know i got the

718
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,919
directory right because they're in here

719
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,200
next to

720
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,360
this adb command

721
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
that's going to save you a lot of time a

722
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,480
lot of headache if you save these two

723
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,799
files next to each other

724
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,799
your life is easy

725
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,480
so

726
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,030
definitely do that

727
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,200
[Music]

728
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,960
uh let's see what else can i do to stall

729
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,159
for time while that downloads

730
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,520
it's my next slide oh yeah this is how

731
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,039
you enable developer options

732
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,320
what else

733
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,640
live demo oh yeah so

734
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,760
live demo that's it that's all i got

735
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,799

751
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,760
uh giveaways for besides that you can

752
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,799

754
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,720
course from

755
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,799
applied network defense and we've got a

756
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,919
bunch of

757
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,399
vouchers for pentester lab so and we

758
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,320
also have like some discount codes for

759
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,640
other stuff so if you go there there are

760
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,080
some pin commands uh so pin messages so

761
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,600
you can check that out if you if you'd

762
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,559
like to

763
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,000
have a chance to win one of those

764
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,600
well definitely check that out i will

765
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
i'm not sure if i'm allowed but

766
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,720
anyway my file download is ready

767
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,360
that's exciting thank you for that

768
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,559
uh uh what do i do now let's see

769
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,480
it says connect the device to your pc by

770
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,679
usb

771
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,399
because you've already done that

772
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,320
on the computer type the command adb

773
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,960
reboot bootloader i can actually skip

774
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,399
this step because i didn't restart the

775
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,320
phone so this is the one only time i'm

776
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,439
going to tell you to skip the step

777
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
if your phone is already unlocked if

778
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,159
it's not unlocked then you need this

779
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,360
step so

780
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,039
in my particular case

781
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,410
i can skip it

782
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,919
[Music]

783
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,720
now i'm going to go into fastboot mode

784
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,919
dot slash

785
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,919
fast boot mode

786
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,320
and devices

787
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,760
and i'm gonna see it's connected

788
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,480
excellent so we have positive control

789
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,250
over this phone right now

790
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,320
[Music]

791
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,200
and

792
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,960
i'm gonna go ahead and flash new

793
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,279
firmware onto this phone

794
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,799
the firmware i just downloaded in fact

795
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,360
so to do that dot slash

796
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,900
fast boot

797
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,640

798
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,120
flash

799
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,799
boot

800
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,799
and then that special file name that i

801
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,080
downloaded

802
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,480
which um you can see it up here ignore

803
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,080
the part file now that the download is

804
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,399
finished the part file's gone

805
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,919
this is the file

806
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,720
the only file that will be there

807
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,559
i'm going to type the l

808
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,080
i n for lineage and i'm going to hit tab

809
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,520
and it's going to type all that stuff

810
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,039
for me

811
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,279
and then i hit enter

812
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,200
and it's going to flash that firmware to

813
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,200
the phone and it says okay on the right

814
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,000
and it said it only took

815
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,520
2.039 seconds it's very exacting

816
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,200
apparently

817
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,399
so i just flash firmware onto this phone

818
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,559
if you just followed along um pat

819
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,159
yourself on the back

820
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,840
because um

821
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,279
you're kind of a developer now

822
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,000

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,640
so the firmware you just flashed gives

854
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,080
you this

855
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,960
it's called the lineage os recovery this

856
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,200
is the fancy recovery software

857
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,480
and what's kind of cool about this

858
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,559
actually is it is touchable like this

859
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,480
interface it they actually put enough

860
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,960
love and care into it to make it

861
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,080
finger interactive

862
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,440
so with the

863
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,080
preinstall instructions

864
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,519
i'm going to read this real quick to

865
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,120
make sure i don't break anything

866
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,000
sideload the copy partitions.zip package

867
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,120
by doing the following so this brick is

868
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,679
kind of intimidating

869
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,399
i just read all of this up to here so to

870
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,679
do this side load the copy

871
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,880
partitions.zip package by doing the

872
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,799
following

873
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,770
download it from here

874
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,559
[Music]

875
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,000
yeah

876
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,279
it's a different file host but um

877
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,679
that's what you get i guess when you

878
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,200
download lineage os you do have to

879
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,159
download from a third party

880
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,120
i'm gonna go ahead and download it let's

881
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,679
see if i can get a little bit closer to

882
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,919
my region

883
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,919
i'm gonna save that file

884
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,159
in the platform tools folder

885
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,840
save it

886
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,240
and that wasn't too bad

887
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,000
and i'm also going to go ahead and kick

888
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,679
off that download like i said i would

889
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,399
because it's a lot bigger

890
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,000
and we're going to let that run while i

891
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,559
do this

892
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,000
all right

893
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,480
download the copy partitions file did

894
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,360
that sideload the zip package on the

895
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,960
device select apply update

896
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,519
apply update

897
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,480
and then apply from adb to begin side

898
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,000
load

899
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,600
it's now in adb side load mode

900
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,440
active slot b

901
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,840
cool

902
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,919
the copy part so it has a warning here

903
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,000
i feel like it should be in red because

904
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,480
it is a security warning

905
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,440
lenny and joe s the publisher

906
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,679
is telling you

907
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,440
that it was created by a developer

908
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,200
but it isn't signed with the official

909
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,919
lineage os key therefore the lineage os

910
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,240
recovery software

911
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,640
is going to complain about it it's going

912
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,279
to say signature verification failed

913
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,960
but

914
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,799
they're telling you to click continue so

915
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,799
i'm reading these instructions on the

916
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,640
wiki.lineageos.org

917
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,159
website

918
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,320
and i'm going to make sure i'm actually

919
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,240
viewing these instructions from a um

920
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,760
a good source so i'm going to view their

921
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,679
certificate real quick just to make sure

922
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,960
i trust this domain

923
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,518
and lookie.lineageos.org

924
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,960
so it is ssl encrypted and it's under

925
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,290
the lineage os dot org domain

926
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,560
[Music]

927
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,520
so

928
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,879
if i go to that domain

929
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,599
are these also people i trust

930
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,969
yeah i think so

931
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:30,399
[Music]

932
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,879
that missing owner field is a bit

933
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,560
funny but they're just using let's

934
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,879
encrypt certificates so

935
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,520
it's kind of you know entry-level tls

936
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,440
certificate but it's there

937
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,199
and i trust these people

938
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,560
so i'm going to take this advice today

939
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,300
and bypass the security warning

940
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,520
[Music]

941
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,839
so

942
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,040
i'm going to run the command they tell

943
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,960
me to run which is this command i'm

944
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,880
going to highlight here

945
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,560
i'm going to go to the terminal i'm

946
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,000
going to clear it because it's cluttered

947
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,839
[Music]

948
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,640
and i'm going to type dot slash because

949
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,560
we didn't install adb

950
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,200
adb

951
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,839
side load

952
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,200
copy

953
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,960
and then from there i can just hit tab

954
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,880
copy

955
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,320
hmm why didn't i tab complete it

956
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,119
dash partitions there we go

957
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,440
it needed the dash so copy dash and

958
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,400
that's enough to make it distinct

959
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,920
so i hit tab and it auto completed that

960
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,520
and i'm going to go ahead and execute

961
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,040
the command on the computer and when i

962
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,800
do you're going to see a lot of stuff

963
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,119
happen on the phone on the webcam over

964
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,520
here okay

965
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,599
and hit enter

966
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,160
and it's serving a file

967
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,400
no there it goes

968
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,800
so you got some text down here and you

969
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,720
got the signature verification failed

970
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,480
install anyway they warned us about that

971
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,320
so we're going to accept it

972
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,280
yes

973
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,640
and it's going to install things

974
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,200
very nice

975
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:26,720
[Music]

976
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,620
um

977
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:37,049
[Music]

978
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,079
[Music]

979
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,540
cool it looks like it just finished

980
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,040
[Music]

981
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,280
now reboot to recovery by typing

982
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,720
advanced

983
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,520
and then reboot to recovery

984
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,520
so to get to advanced we're going to go

985
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,839
back

986
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,480
and then

987
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,040
advanced

988
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,480
reboot

989
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,359
to recovery

990
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,839
excellent

991
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,880
there's that ominous bootloader warning

992
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,790
be proud of it i am

993
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,240
[Music]

994
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,880
so now i'm in a bit of a pickle as far

995
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,880
as the presentation is concerned because

996
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,040
i have to download the linux

997
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,119
lineage os installation package

998
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,480
and

999
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,400
i already started it and it says it's

1000
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,880
got 22 minutes left

1001
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,160
which is a long time to wait to download

1002
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,200
file

1003
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,880
i was hoping

1004
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,480
when i tested this

1005
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,079
during my practice session the internet

1006
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,119
was a little bit faster than this

1007
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,560
today it's not so fast

1008
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,280
so it's it's creeping down it's got 16

1009
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,200
minutes on the clock

1010
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,359
but um that's a lot of time

1011
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,640
to ask my um

1012
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,720
to ask my audience to wait which i was

1013
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
prepared to do if people were following

1014
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,320
along

1015
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,240
but in this case uh

1016
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,400
yeah i don't have any tv magic that i

1017
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,640
can pull today

1018
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,400
oh gosh yeah we think we can do a 15

1019
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,760
minutes break

1020
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,720
early and then we can continue

1021
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,640
okay

1022
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,480
that sounds like an excellent plan so

1023
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,599
sorry everyone if i had um thought about

1024
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,520
this particular problem ahead of time i

1025
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,200
guess this is kind of the

1026
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,079
what i sign up for i guess when i do

1027
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,599
this live

1028
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,040
um

1029
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,520
yeah i'm used to fiber internet at home

1030
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,720
and

1031
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,520
i have it all to myself

1032
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,240
so yeah we'll go ahead and take a break

1033
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,839
and um

1034
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,839
yeah get a coffee get chips um

1035
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,880
if you leave that's fine i forgive you

1036
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,839
and

1037
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,000
yeah all

1038
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
speak up when it's finished downloading

1039
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,040
and we'll continue from there

1040
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:23,659
[Music]

1041
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,760
okay

1042
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,400
it's downloaded everybody

1043
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,079
come back

1044
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,160
come back to me

1045
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,598
i'll show you the next step

1046
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,799
we are continuing

1047
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,720
so

1048
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,320
we're in the first step

1049
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,400
of installing

1050
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,160
lineage os

1051
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,880
from recovery

1052
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,200
[Music]

1053
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,400
to help us all

1054
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,230
focus i'm going to turn off the music

1055
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,040
[Music]

1056
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,280
and we'll keep it low

1057
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,900
i think it feels nice

1058
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,030
[Music]

1059
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,160
they're telling you if you wanted to

1060
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,640
sneak in some google apps because you

1061
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,680
can't live without them personally i

1062
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,560
miss google maps

1063
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,920
everything else i can live without but

1064
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,560
google maps was one that i kind of wish

1065
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,359
i still had

1066
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,720
so

1067
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,400
if we're not already into recovery

1068
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,440
they're telling you to reboot into

1069
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,599
recovery we left it

1070
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,079
in recovery it's over here

1071
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,119
so

1072
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,480
we're going to factory reset this phone

1073
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,560
then format data factory reset

1074
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,560
it's going to delete everything

1075
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,440
so

1076
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,920
be ready for that i did plan ahead on

1077
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,119
this part and i did back up my phone

1078
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,400
so here we go delete everything factory

1079
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,079
reset

1080
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,960
and then format data factory reset

1081
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,440
do you want

1082
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,920
to format user data that means all the

1083
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,000
files you care about so if you care

1084
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,720
about these files click cancel

1085
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,560
i don't care about my files so i'm going

1086
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,599
to format data

1087
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,150
it's going to erase all my stuff

1088
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,360
[Music]

1089
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,359
and then when we're done we're gonna

1090
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,480
return to step four

1091
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,720
all right there it is data bike complete

1092
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,319
so we get to return to the main menu

1093
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,880
and we're going to sideload

1094
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,319
the big

1095
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,079
android file we just waited to download

1096
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,839
so on the device select apply update

1097
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,000
then apply from adb just like we did for

1098
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,160
recovery

1099
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,960
apply from adb

1100
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,000
and now i get to apply the update from

1101
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,119
my computer

1102
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,079
so i'm going to go into the terminal now

1103
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,720
i'm already in the folder where the edb

1104
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,880
command exists and i can confirm that by

1105
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,760
just listing the directories

1106
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,480
i think yeah it should be here there it

1107
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,480
is right there

1108
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,160
cool

1109
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,200
so dot slash

1110
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,440
edb

1111
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,720
side load

1112
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,640
and then the file name now what's the

1113
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,800
file name

1114
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,480
well i can cheat i can go here

1115
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,050
lineage dash 18

1116
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:41,280
[Music]

1117
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,520
is what i think i'll need to make this

1118
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,520
file unique enough for the next part

1119
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,359
which is tab completion so i'm going to

1120
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,560
hit tab

1121
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,319
and it's going to complete that for me

1122
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,800
and look it's stopped

1123
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,160
so apparently the recovery i downloaded

1124
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,280
is

1125
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,440
named similarly enough

1126
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,680
to the recovery

1127
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,680
so the file name is the same all the way

1128
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,920
up to here so it stopped and it's now

1129
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,839
kind of asking me

1130
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,680
do you want

1131
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,079
to um do you want the recovery so you

1132
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,240
type r or do you want the nightly signed

1133
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,599
zip

1134
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,599
so i want the nightly signed zip so i'm

1135
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,560
going to type n and then tab

1136
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,440
and i'm ending with a dot zip

1137
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,280
which is what they're telling me here

1138
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,000
it's going to be a filename.zip

1139
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,400
cool

1140
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,000
so the next part i'm going to read this

1141
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,760
ahead of time

1142
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,160
the process succeeds the output will

1143
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,520
stop at 47

1144
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,599
i'm going to say that again it will stop

1145
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,040
at 47

1146
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,200
which is misleading because it's kind of

1147
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,440
scary like you get a progress bar and

1148
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,319
you expect it to go to 100 right

1149
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,200
on my phone now

1150
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,760
oh yeah look at that good eye

1151
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,240
uh so to get to the front of this

1152
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,480
command and bash i'm gonna type control

1153
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,000
a

1154
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,560
and then right

1155
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,599
thank you thank you very much um joe

1156
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:10,560
j-o-e-t-joe

1157
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,880
a db is the command i need thank you

1158
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,640
thank you thank you

1159
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,839
now i'm going to go to the end of the

1160
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,680
line i was going to press some

1161
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,640
end

1162
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,480
all right

1163
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,359
cool

1164
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,839
so success in some cases it will report

1165
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,960
adb failed to read command no error

1166
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,359
which is also fine so

1167
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,960
just because you're going to see if you

1168
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,240
see an error message here doesn't

1169
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,319
necessarily mean something bad happened

1170
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,319
so be prepared for that

1171
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,760
i'm going to go and hit enter and we're

1172
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,200
going to watch on the phone just to kind

1173
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,078
of see what it does

1174
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,960
click in hit enter

1175
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,520
and there goes it is now serving files

1176
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,240
to my phone and those files are being

1177
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,540
um acknowledged by the phone

1178
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,680
[Music]

1179
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,119
and we're just going to watch that

1180
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,240
progress bar tick up fortunately it is a

1181
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,960
lot faster than the download

1182
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,880
so this will probably take about a

1183
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,440
minute or two

1184
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,599
and um if you do actually get to this

1185
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,960
point again

1186
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,319
pat yourself on the back

1187
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,319
because you're flashing firmware right

1188
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,400
now

1189
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,440
if you get here you're flashing firmware

1190
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,440
which is kind of

1191
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
impressive

1192
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,599
at least in my opinion the more i i feel

1193
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,040
everyone should know how to do this

1194
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,960
and the reason i feel that is because

1195
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,880
google would like you to believe that

1196
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,560
you can't do this

1197
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,240
that you don't have control over your

1198
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,280
phone and that is disposable

1199
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,359
and um i'm here to tell you today that

1200
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,560
um

1201
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,720
your phone is a computer

1202
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,640
it is

1203
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,880
just like your laptop or your desktop

1204
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,720
computer it has a screen keyboard

1205
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,480
inputs and outputs

1206
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,720
it has a bootloader

1207
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,440
and it runs an operating system

1208
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,240
instead of windows or mac os

1209
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,119
it runs android in this case this

1210
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,520
particular flavor of android is called

1211
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,319
lineage os

1212
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,960
it has a cpu

1213
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,920
the cpu on a phone like this is actually

1214
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,560
something called arm architecture

1215
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,000
which is kind of like

1216
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,480
intel for on windows computers and

1217
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,520
nowadays apple makes their own silicon

1218
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,000
and funny thing about that apple silicon

1219
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,119
is actually arm as well

1220
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,359
when apple licensed their chips they

1221
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,760
bought the blueprints from arm

1222
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,359
so fun fact your apple device is

1223
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,720
actually quite similar to this phone

1224
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,160
right here

1225
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,560
yeah yeah only mobile but still they

1226
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,550
license arm it's it's cool

1227
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,920
[Music]

1228
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,440
uh

1229
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,119
anyway where are we

1230
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,720
total transfer

1231
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,280
100x

1232
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,880
that sounds good right

1233
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,520
it's an installing update step two of

1234
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,680
two it looks like it's done let's see

1235
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,000
what the instructions say

1236
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
it's telling me here this is your

1237
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,960
opportunity to install some extra

1238
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,480
software

1239
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,520
onto

1240
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,480
uh the phone so

1241
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,319
this would be your opportunity to

1242
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,119
download software that is kind of um

1243
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,720
kind of shady

1244
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,559
if i'm honest there is one package that

1245
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,720
allows you to um

1246
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,119
to spoof a google signature

1247
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,160
so that way you can get some um special

1248
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,240
google services back on the phone

1249
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,839
i don't recommend it but it's called

1250
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,760
micro g

1251
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,319
so if you want this lineage os phone to

1252
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,480
be a bit more googly you can install

1253
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,559
micro g but this is the time you have to

1254
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:55,520
do it

1255
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,000
once you proceed from this step

1256
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,520
you can't get a full installation of

1257
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,200
micro g and you'll have to do all of

1258
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,359
this again so

1259
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,440
um just kind of you know pin that away

1260
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,040
in the back of your mind in case you get

1261
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,839
really into this

1262
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,680
so yeah and it's telling you if you

1263
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,200
sideload any apps it's going to complain

1264
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,720
with that signature signature

1265
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,640
verification failed again

1266
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,319
[Music]

1267
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,160
so yeah and yeah if you want google apps

1268
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,599
in your phone which i don't understand

1269
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,200
why you would if you're going through

1270
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,119
all the trouble of installing a d

1271
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,040
google's android i don't see why you

1272
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,640
would want these

1273
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,240
but you can do it you can put them back

1274
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,559
all right so we're on step seven once

1275
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,079
you've installed everything click the

1276
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,280
back arrow and then reboot system now so

1277
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,760
i'm going to do that

1278
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,800
reboot system now

1279
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,640
bootloader warning that's never going to

1280
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,920
go away

1281
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,240
uh you can try you can look into

1282
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,760
actually getting this bootloader message

1283
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,800
gone and re-locking the bootloader

1284
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,280
but to my understanding

1285
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,240
you as a developer and you are developer

1286
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,839
now in my opinion

1287
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,160
you as a developer cannot lock that

1288
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,200
bootloader because only the oems

1289
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,280
have the keys to do it

1290
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,119
i might be wrong on this

1291
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,040
you might be able to hack it closed your

1292
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,160
own way but um just know that if you try

1293
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,760
to lock the bootloader you're kind of

1294
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,520
playing with fire

1295
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,520
because um you might you might lock

1296
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,119
yourself out with no way back in so

1297
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,720
just um

1298
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,800
just take care

1299
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,160
and um

1300
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,359
yeah

1301
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,000
we're actually done we're at the bottom

1302
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,480
that was it we we installed lineage os

1303
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,760
today but

1304
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,839
we're not done with the presentation

1305
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,160
because i want to show you the software

1306
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,920
you're going to need

1307
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,319
because

1308
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,960
it's not complete

1309
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,240
so i'm just going to leave it like this

1310
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,799
if you don't mind

1311
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:01,279
lineage doesn't come with an app store

1312
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,160
so i'm going to set my time i guess

1313
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,920
and actually i'm going to take the phone

1314
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,119
off the screen for a minute because i

1315
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,880
just realized i don't have a sim card in

1316
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,880
here but i do have one handy i just have

1317
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,040
to put it in

1318
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,920
so um bear with me one moment

1319
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,599
[Music]

1320
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,599
give this phone a connection to the

1321
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,790
internet

1322
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:33,410
[Music]

1323
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,119
[Applause]

1324
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,079
there's my sim card putting the sim card

1325
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,520
the phone

1326
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,839
okay

1327
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,200
i love how you all here in spain

1328
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,319
actually put sim pins on your sim cards

1329
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,040
i think that's really neat

1330
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,440
okay

1331
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,839
where am i

1332
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,000
i am gmt

1333
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,359
minus two i believe

1334
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,800
where the plus two

1335
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
what's my time zone there it is gmt plus

1336
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,559
two cool

1337
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,319
10 one that looks right that looks right

1338
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,359
next

1339
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,440
and you'll notice just by um i hope

1340
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,040
you're all looking at my webcam by the

1341
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,240
way

1342
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,200
because that's what i'm doing i'm

1343
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,760
playing with the phone right now

1344
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,839
so you'll notice it's a lot like setting

1345
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,160
up a regular android phone that all of

1346
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,559
these things are kind of the same

1347
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,079
except

1348
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,440
um

1349
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,680
you don't get google

1350
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,720
standing in front of the door telling

1351
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,119
you you have to agree to all these terms

1352
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,359
and conditions before you're allowed to

1353
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,599
use your own phone

1354
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:44,960
here it just

1355
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,240
enables features and lets you in

1356
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,800
which i love and appreciate

1357
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,200
so i just enabled cellular data and now

1358
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,040
i'm going to go ahead and hit

1359
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,480
next

1360
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,079
it's asking if i want to enable location

1361
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,160
services i actually like lineage os so

1362
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,079
i'm going to leave that on

1363
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,559
i usually turn it off with google

1364
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,240
and i'm going to help lineage os i'm

1365
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,680
actually going to give them my logs

1366
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,240
because i love lineage os i love their

1367
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,119
developers i love everything about them

1368
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,559
i appreciate that they went through all

1369
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,400
the trouble to make this

1370
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,640
as painless as it can get and it

1371
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,040
actually could get more painless but

1372
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,280
this is manageable i i'm prepared to

1373
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,880
live like this

1374
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,079
if you ask me if i want to set up a

1375
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,920
fingerprint i'm going to skip that right

1376
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,440
now

1377
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,480
and

1378
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,280
if i protect it i can set a pin and

1379
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,640
encrypt it and all that good stuff i'm

1380
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,720
going to skip for now

1381
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,240
and i'll restore my data later so i'm

1382
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,400
just going to hit start

1383
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,079
and there it is

1384
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,480
lineage os

1385
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,960
and all its lovely glory here's all the

1386
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,880
apps you get

1387
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,280
um web browser it's not firefox or

1388
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,200
anything it's just called web browser i

1389
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,520
don't know what it is

1390
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,960
uh and yeah you'll notice in here

1391
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,200
there's no app store

1392
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,599
there's no google play they even removed

1393
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,040
f droid

1394
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,359
so we have to go get one

1395
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,000
so here's where you get it

1396
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,800
fdroid.org

1397
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,280
and ooh look at that it went to google

1398
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,400
as its default search provider gross

1399
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,319
they should fix that in the next release

1400
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,480
duckduckgo thank you very much

1401
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,280
f dash droid

1402

[Music]

1403
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,010
don't work

1404
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:36,960
[Music]

1405
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,160
and that'll probably get me there

1406
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:44,559
yep there is a google map like app i'll

1407
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,880
show you what it is

1408
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,240
uh

1409
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,000
first i'm gonna download an app store

1410
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,680
because i need an app store to show it

1411
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,800
to you

1412
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
so i'm gonna go ahead and allow

1413
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,480
i'm installing f droid right now i'm

1414
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,640
going to download it

1415
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,200
when it's finished downloading

1416
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,119
i'll install it and i'll install it like

1417
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,200
you do install software on a regular

1418
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,559
computer

1419
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,079
i'm going to browse down here i'm going

1420
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,480
to click that apk

1421
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,400
it's going to give me a security warning

1422
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,319
this phone is not allowed to install

1423
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,480
unknown apps from the source

1424
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,280
and actually this phone is like it's

1425
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,880
it's set up very securely because you

1426
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,119
can't install any software aside from

1427
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,520
side loading once it's booted

1428
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,520
like they've got no way in

1429
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,040
so you actually have to go to settings

1430
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,800
like it tells you to and just click the

1431
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,720
thing that's telling you to click

1432
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,040
which is to allow me to install software

1433
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,799
from the browser

1434
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,640
which i need to do

1435
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,920
to install

1436
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,760
f droid which is an app store

1437
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,880
welcome to f droid

1438
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,319
i personally recommend you install a lot

1439
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,280
of software out of here as much as you

1440
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,319
can

1441
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,920
because this software

1442
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,440
is free

1443
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,599
not just free is in zero cost i mean

1444
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,359
free is in free is in freedom

1445
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,280
the software is almost always open

1446
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,480
source

1447
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,200
and it's very respectful of your privacy

1448
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,200
and if it's not 100 respectful of your

1449
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,319
privacy f droid will tell you

1450
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,690
right on the front page of that app

1451
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,240
[Music]

1452
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,839
um and now that i've just said that i'm

1453
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:22,400
going to tell you how to find um aurora

1454
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,319
store

1455
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,319
where all the apps you want are going to

1456
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,400
live

1457
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,640
so if you want to install like snapchat

1458
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,119
or facebook or something

1459
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,760
you're not going to find it in f droid

1460
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,280
it just doesn't exist in there

1461
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,240
they do have facebook alternatives

1462
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,760
though

1463
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,720
in my

1464
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,960
personal opinion i like frost for

1465
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,720
facebook they do call it an anti feature

1466
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,280
because it's not 100 privacy respectful

1467
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,880
but when you're dealing with facebook

1468
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,760
that's just kind of what you sign up for

1469
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,319
but frost for facebook is really good

1470
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,960
it's a respectful alternative oh yeah so

1471
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,960
i have to enable this one to install

1472
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,119
software as well so f droid is an app

1473
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,880
store it's reasonable to allow it to

1474
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,119
install software

1475
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,559
i'm going to install frost because i

1476
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,480
like frost actually

1477
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,839
i'm going to go back and i'm going to

1478
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:21,359
find the aurora store

1479
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,890
a u r o r a

1480

[Music]

1481
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,799
install

1482
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,190
takes just a moment

1483
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,760
[Music]

1484
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,839
and this is really neat

1485
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,680
i don't know

1486
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,440
much about them and i do want to

1487
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,280
understand a little bit more about how

1488
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,599
they're operating

1489
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:44,640
because

1490
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,680
i'm not

1491
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,280
i'm not sure how they get away with it

1492
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,200
frankly but

1493
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,200
uh it's basically a copy of the google

1494
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,480
play store

1495
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,839
but it's not served by google

1496
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:56,640
so

1497
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,640
after reading agree just in terms at

1498
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,920
some point i am going to read these

1499
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,000
because i do want to know more about

1500
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,559
this store

1501
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:05,359
and

1502
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,520
yeah i'm going to set it up next i'm

1503
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,559
just going to accept the defaults and

1504
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,640
i'm going to read them

1505
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,640
next sounds good

1506
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,480
i like this color

1507
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,920
next

1508
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,760
i have to grant three permissions that's

1509
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,680

why are you stuck

1523
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,359
[Music]

1524
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:49,440
there we go cool

1525
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,000
so you can choose to log in with google

1526
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,720
or

1527
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,760
you can go anonymous mode you can just

1528
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,920
get into the play store

1529
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,079
without signing in

1530
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,440
imagine that

1531
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,240
just

1532
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,799
downloading software

1533
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,280
and then installing it

1534
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,880
what enough concept

1535
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,359
um

1536
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,119
speaking of just downloading software

1537
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,559
and installing it that's actually my

1538
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,839
next slide

1539
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,359
um

1540
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,520
personal safety

1541
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,599
you're operating outside

1542
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,920
the walled garden of google all right

1543
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,000
when you use a google phone you're

1544
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,319
trusting google to protect you

1545
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,280
and

1546
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,960
they want your business

1547
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,280
so they protect you really really

1548
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,680
aggressively

1549
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,119
since we've abandoned google you

1550
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,559
the user

1551
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,880
are now accountable

1552
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,520
for your own online safety

1553
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,680
if anything should happen to your phone

1554
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,599
if your data is stolen

1555
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,280
you can't run and complain to google

1556
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,119
i'm not saying you're any more or less

1557
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,079
safe

1558
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:03,599
per se if you

1559
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,400
behave like a reasonable person

1560
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,359
you're gonna be fine but

1561
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,319
i still recommend you install something

1562
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:15,520
to protect yourself

1563
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,520
i use sofas

1564
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,759

1565
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,100

[Music]

1567
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,559
and the reason i use sophos intercept x

1568
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,640
is because it's free

1569
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,240
they don't charge any money

1570
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,880
so that's kind of nice

1571
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,440
uh it looks like it's still downloading

1572
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,240
um some repos

1573
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,640
so it's not showing up just yet but it

1574
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,319
will i believe in it

1575
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,070

1587
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,640
like

1588
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,040
i install it immediately it's the first

1589
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,000
thing i do whenever i

1590
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,920
re-google my phone i

1591
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,079
install this app

1592
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,839
it scans your apps every time you

1593
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,720
install something and if it recognizes a

1594
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,720
low reputation app

1595
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,520
or

1596
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,480
something

1597

malicious looking it will notify you and

1598
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,200
it will prompt you to remove it

1599
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,240
so

1600
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,160
it's nice it's gonna accept and continue

1601

micro g

1628
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:45,119
um someone asked if there is a google

1629
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,119
map like alternative and there is i'm

1630
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,480
gonna go and go to the aurora store and

i'm gonna show you what that is right

now the google map alternative i use is

01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,839
called here

1634
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,240
we

1635
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,370
go

01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:04,569
[Music]

1637
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,400
yep they have a beta and a regular

1638
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,880
version they're both pretty good

1639
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,400
um

1640
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,039
i like stable software so

1641
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:16,400
i'm going to install a regular version

1642
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,480
and i'm going to level with you right

1643
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,200
now it's no google

1644
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,079
it doesn't have street view

1645
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,000
and it doesn't have the most up-to-date

1646
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,240
hours for businesses so it's not the

1647
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,720
best directory listing

1648
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,720
so

[Music]

1650
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,720
yeah it is pretty good with metro though

1651
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,880
i i do get around here in barcelona

1652
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,620
really well

[Music]

1654
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,880
and you know it's all thanks to this app

1655
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,079
and um when i want to actually use

1656
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,160
google maps

1657
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,880
i like to um

1658
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,640
actually set it up

1659
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,440
i um i pin it to my home page i actually

1660
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,680
have both google maps and here we go and

1661
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,160
i use them both because

1662
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,160
i'm still dependent on the business

1663
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,680
listings

1664
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,480
for

1665
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,559
google maps

1666
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,640
so

1667
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,079
yep there's some full disclosure for you

1668
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,039
finally micro g i do need to bring up

1669
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,160
micro g

1670
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,799
because it's

1671
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,960
it has some pluses and minuses that you

1672
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,480
need to be aware of

1673
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,920
at some point you're going to run into a

1674
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,160
feature that isn't going to work without

1675
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,920
some kind of google play services and

1676
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,960
it's going to be a feature you will miss

1677
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,039
so

1678
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,000
if you want to go there you can go there

oh actually yeah you can't even download

1681
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,880
it from the f droid store you actually

1682
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,559
have to download it from their website

1683
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:53,119
that's right i forgot

1684
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,359
uh i'm going to open a web browser

1685
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:57,599

01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,799
is the official publisher of this app

1692
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,359
there are some copycats

1693
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:18,960
and

1694
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,240
honestly it's

1695
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,359
they're all kind of shady

1696
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,920
but at least in my opinion it's the fact

1697
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,920
that they have a spoop signature and

1698
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,160
they're encouraging the use of it in my

1699
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,920
opinion is kind of stepping over the

1700
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,599
line

1701
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:36,480
but

1702
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,480
yeah this is where you go to download it

1703
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,200
you install a repo into f droid i'm just

1704
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,880
going to tap on the address they give

1705
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,839
you fingerprint signing key all of that

1706
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,119
if you open this

1707
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,480
on your

1708
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,039
computer you can just scan that qr code

1709
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,200
and it will install the repo for you

1710
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,799
which is the same as just clicking this

1711
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,319
link

1712
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,960
it's going to open it in f droid i

1713
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,119
believe

1714
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,480
open

1715
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,480
at least i was hoping it would

1716
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,760
address

1717
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,720
afraid archive

1718
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,039
yeah i'm going to install firefox real

1719
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,720
quick because this built-in browser

1720
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,359
isn't actually good enough for me

1721
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,280
so yeah the default lineage os

1722
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,240
experience is very pared down it's as

1723
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,160
google free as it gets and as free as it

1724
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,000
gets but

1725
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,160
my the world i live in demands a little

1726
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,280
bit more of me so i use a more fully

1727
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,000
featured browser like firefox which also

1728
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,400
happens to respect my privacy

1729
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,359
i'm gonna let that install this progress

1730

link an external app button and it got

1764
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:02,000
it to pre-populate all of this

1765
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,039
ah what a fuss

1766
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,720
it's okay it's worth it

1767
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,640
and

1768
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,880
excellent now it's going to pull down

1769
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,520
that repo i believe

1770
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,600
or not

1771
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,599
[Music]

1772
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,280
i'm going to force it to update this

1773
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,520
repositories

1774
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,119
cool and now i'm going to search for

1775
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,810
micro g in the f droid store

1776
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:28,799
[Music]

1777
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,440
there it is micro g services core

1778
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,400
re-implementation of google play

1779
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,559
services

1780
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,960
um

1781
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,599
yeah and it kind of spoofs google play

1782
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,039
services

1783
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,359
kind of puts them back

1784
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:48,400
and i actually do use this i don't

1785
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,400
really recommend doing it unless you

1786
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,640
have to

1787
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,640
but

1788
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,839
i need notifications

1789
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:01,520
push notifications are served

1790
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:05,599
by a service called firebase

1791
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:06,559
um

1792
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,400
i really don't know too much about it

1793
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,200
but what i do understand is that push

1794
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,680
notifications originate

1795
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,200
from the web

1796
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,560
and they are served to your phone

1797
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,120
how does firebase know what phone you

1798
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,198
have well

1799
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,000
google issues you a special token it's

1800
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,600
like a key

1801
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,000
and it's registered

1802
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,319
with firebase so your key

1803
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,640
to get your notifications is registered

1804
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,399
firebase so anytime

1805
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,399
an application wants to publish a

1806
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:40,560
notification to you they uniquely

1807
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,238
identify you with your registered token

1808
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:47,759
so i'm going to install it

1809
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,600
and yeah we're going to open it

1810
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,040
this is where you would add a google

1811
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,040
account if you had one

1812
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,040
and the thing you really want is um

1813
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,040
i believe it's this one google device

1814
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,279
registration

1815
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,640
and that's yeah that's the key the

1816
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,960
unique identifier micro g strips

1817
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,040
identifying bits other than your google

1818
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,319
account name from registration data

1819
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,600
and you want to enable this

1820
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,920
google device registration if you want

1821
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,679
push notification to show up on your

1822
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:24,238
phone so things like discord or slack

1823
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:26,319
you need you need to do this in order

1824
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:27,920
for those notifications to make it to

1825
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,839
you

1826
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:30,560
so

1827
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,120
[Music]

1828
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,520

1829
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,199

1830
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,679
you all have what you need

1831
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,198

1832
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,600
take off from here

1833
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,600
you have an app store you have a web

1834
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,719
browser you actually have two app stores

1835
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,000
so um

1836
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,040

01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,280
all right

1861
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,360
so this is the url

1862
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,360
myaccount.google.com

1863
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,920
you need to set up something called an

1864
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,080
application password

1865
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,640
and the reason you need to do that

1866
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,960
is because

1867
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,000
the free webmail app that i use doesn't

1868
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,760
support oauth

1869
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,600
some of them do if you're willing to

1870
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,600
spend some money

1871
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,920
you can actually get

1872
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,400
mail apps you can even install gmail i

1873
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,520
think

1874
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,400
but um i like to use from the f droid

1875
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:28,239
store because i'm a weirdo okay

1876
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,040
uh

1877
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,440
fair

1878
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,600
mail there it is fair email fully

1879
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,800
featured email client

1880
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,400
and

1881
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,520
they do support oauth but the one served

1882
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,760
up by f droid

1883
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,560
isn't licensed to have oauth

1884
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,120
so it doesn't support oauth unless you

1885
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,040
pay fair mail

1886
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,880
and get the fully featured one which in

1887
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,560
my personal opinion is probably actually

1888
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,800
a really good thing to do

1889
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,719
because it saves you all the setup of

1890
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,960
having to do things to your google

1891
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,880
account

1892
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,520
but you don't have to pay money

1893
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,960
i'll show you how to get away with it

1894
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,880
without paying money

1895
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,840
so it's fair and open source focuses on

1896
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,679
privacy and security and you're going to

1897
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,440
get like private and security every time

1898
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,280
you download an app from f droid it's

1899
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,400
just

1900
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,040
kind of their mantra if you will

1901
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,159
i'm going to agree to those terms

1902
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,840
because i really like them

1903
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,239
and i'm going to add an account

1904
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,000
and it's going to be yeah and again

1905
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,719
normally gmail oauth

1906
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,719
it does it only works in official

1907
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:35,040
versions only because android chats the

1908
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,360
signature okay so yeah all walk doesn't

1909
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,800
work

1910
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,080
but that's okay

1911
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,120
because i'm going to go to other

1912
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,560
provider

1913
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,480
and i'm going to set it up another way

1914
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,159
so i give it a name

1915
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:49,040
can beginning name email address

1916
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,080
kim at

1917
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,759
kim's domain

1918
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,520
dot com

1919
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,040
and in this case it's actually gonna be

1920
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,040
gmail.com

1921
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:05,440
[Music]

1922
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,360
and for the password you have to go to

1923
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,239
the

1924
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:14,320
security tab i believe

1925
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,600
where is it

1926
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,159
data in privacy yes security tab so on

1927
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,920
my screen

1928
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,520
i have to

1929
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,480
create an app password

1930
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,400
so i go in here to app passwords

1931
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,199
i uh authenticate

1932
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,239
this is all ssl so

1933
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:39,199
i select an app

1934
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,040
give it a name i like to name it what it

1935
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,199
is going to at least the device so

1936
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,120
6t

1937
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,960
uh

1938
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,810
now yeah

1939
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:51,679
[Music]

1940
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,840
and i generate and if i do that it will

1941
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,719
show me a password that i can type into

1942
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:58,000
this box

1943
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,480
which lets me in

1944
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,159
the password

1945
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:05,440
in my opinion is a lot less secure

1946
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,159
it is at least a one

1947
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,080
a password that only serves a single

1948
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,520
purpose so on that front

1949
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,880
it's

1950
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,239
it's a bit

1951
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:18,800
more focused but ultimately i don't

1952
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,280
really like app passwords and i don't

1953
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,760
like using them

1954
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,440
that is how i operate for the time being

1955
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,360
um i implore all of you if

1956
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,440
if you follow in these footsteps if you

1957
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,920
decide that you want an android phone

1958
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,840
that's de-googled

1959
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,400
i implore you to go out search find

1960
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,320
an application a mail application that

1961
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,880
supports oauth because olaf

1962
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,600
is actually a stronger

1963
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,920
method of authentication and the app

1964
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,400
passwords should really not be used

1965
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,000
unless you have to but

1966
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,920
you can do it this way you absolutely

1967
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,760
can

1968
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,840
[Music]

1969
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,640
so

1970
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,600
yeah

1971
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,199
any other

1972
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:10,199
questions

1973
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:14,779
[Music]

1974
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,679
what can i share about lineage of less

1975
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:25,760
stability

1976
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,520
i

1977
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,600
i personally in the last year

1978
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,800
i have found it to be completely stable

1979
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,120
i have not had a single issue and mind

1980
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,960
you i install

1981
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,280
every update they send me

1982
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,440
when i see an update they push their ota

1983
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,640
updates on

1984
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,400
it's either weekly or bi-weekly i don't

1985
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,239
know when i see one i just install it i

1986
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:51,600
don't think twice i don't read the

1987
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,360
change logs

1988
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,400
i i just install it and it's been

1989
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,159
incredibly stable and trustworthy

1990
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,640
of course

1991
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,840
i'm using this phone

1992
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,520
so take that with a grain of salt if

1993
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,199
your phone

1994
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:10,159
is

1995
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:12,239
supported by a developer who probably

1996
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,159
doesn't care as much then maybe it's

1997
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:15,840
less stable

1998
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,280
i don't know

1999
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,040
but i can tell you

2000
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,600
in my personal experience on the oneplus

2001
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,199
6t fajita

2002
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,879
it's incredibly stable

2003
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,800
i have not had

2004
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,120
any problems

2005
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,360
you know outside of the usual

2006
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,759
i don't have google type problems

2007
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,080
which is kind of a nice way to live i'm

2008
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,120
i'm kind of proud of it i own it

2009
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,040
uh

2010
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,480
it's a lifestyle choice and

2011
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,840
if you do

2012
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,679
choose to live like this

2013
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,000
i do recommend

2014
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,600
going out and getting a second phone

2015
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,159
use that new phone purchase to buy a

2016
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,480
phone that's supported

2017
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,520
and then keep your old phone

2018
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,360
and the reason i say that is sometimes

2019
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,199
you run into situations where you have

2020
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:14,400
to have to have to have google

2021
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,480
and you must use it

2022
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,159
and in those situations you can pull

2023
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:19,280
that phone

2024
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,600
out of your back pocket or off your desk

2025
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,440
or whatever

2026
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,320
and

2027
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,880
you have you can turn it on just use it

2028
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,320
for that purpose and then turn it off so

2029
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,640
you can kind of at least

2030
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,280
compartmentalize

2031
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,360
the areas of your life

2032
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,799
where google is required

2033
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,320
sorry i got a bit ranty there did that

2034
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:46,320

2035
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,440

[Music]

2039
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,280
all right

2040
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,970
well

2042
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,719
i guess that's uh

2043
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:16,880
i guess that's the end of my uh my

2044
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,060

[Music]

2046
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,000
um

2047
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,480
this question is more what it feels like

2048
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,560
to possess your own data it's quite

2049
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:27,920
satisfying

2050
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,960
i

2051
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,840
i have a nas a network attached storage

2052
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,360
appliance

2053
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,400
um

2054
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,520
where i house all of my data

2055
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,800
at some point i'm actually going to set

2056
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,480
up a personal cloud i'm

2057
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,640
i i like to pick and choose where i

2058
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,960
trust cloud technologies and having my

2059
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,199
entire personal file system connected to

2060
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:51,120
the internet does kind of make me a bit

2061
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,719
nervous

2062
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:56,159
so i'm still devising a way to maybe

2063
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:59,360
have a separate just on cloud private

2064
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,400
nas

2065
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,159
solution

2066
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:03,280
but um

2067
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,239
it's very satisfying to um to not be

2068
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,560
constantly leaking

2069
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,600
as much information to google

2070
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,000
um you can't really escape google

2071
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,840
because

2072
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,880
if you have any presence at all

2073
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:19,679
um

2074
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,280
on the internet

2075
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,080
you're

2076
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,320
you're public you're exposed right so

2077
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:27,040
anything anyone sees during those public

2078
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,280
exposed times

2079
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,360
are candidate for being logged and

2080
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,040
recorded

2081
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,640
so

2082
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,800
google being the advertising company

2083
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,560
that they are are very interested in

2084
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,560
profiling you

2085
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,159
and they want to know as much about you

2086
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:44,960
as they can possibly take from you

2087
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,159
so

2088
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:48,640
google knows things about you and

2089
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,159
there's nothing you can do to get away

2090
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:51,760
from that

2091
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,000
except fight back

2092
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,280
you can stop

2093
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,080
willingly giving them things

2094
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,320
if they if they get something about you

2095
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,480
they have to take it from you

2096
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,520
that's my take on the matter

2097
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,480
so

2098
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,239
i like to fight back i liked it i like

2099
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:10,400
to use the software

2100
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,638
um

2101
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:14,960
it's

2102
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,280
makes me feel good

2103
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,920
bubbly inside even when even when things

2104
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,920
don't work even when i even when i can't

2105
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,520
unlock

2106
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,800
my amazon locker

2107
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,560
i still feel good because it's a

2108
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,840
reminder that i made it

2109
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,199
amount of time before i ran into a

2110
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:37,360
feature that i need

2111
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,520
that requires google and that's that was

2112
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,040
like months

2113
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,000
where i just operated without google and

2114
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,920
then suddenly this thing came up and i i

2115
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,760
don't carry my google phone anymore

2116
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,120
because of that

2117
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,120
i never need it

2118
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,040
except when i go pick up packages from

2119
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,639
amazon

2120
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:56,800
so

2121
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,920
yeah sorry but i seem distracted i'm

2122
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,440
enrolling a fingerprint right now

2123
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,639
i'm following my um instructions that

2124
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:11,760
bit warden is giving me

2125
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,590
so yeah

2126
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:15,040
[Music]

2127
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,639
were there any other times where i

2128
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:19,199
needed google services

2129
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:21,440
uh

2130
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,480
let me think back here

2131
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:31,120
i'm sure there are

2132
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,840
uh offhand

2133
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,320
i can't really think of them

2134
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,440
but

2135
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,600
again i've been working

2136
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,520
i've been de-googled i've been using

2137
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,360
lineage os

2138
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,040
for well over a year now

2139
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,120
[Music]

2140
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,559
or at least it feels that um

2141
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,199
so all of the challenges that i've

2142
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:57,199
overcome are kind of behind me i found

2143
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,159
alternatives to google services

2144
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:03,199
and just started using those

2145
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:04,719
so

2146
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,880
yes there have been other times where

2147
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,800
i've needed google services uh the

2148
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,040
google maps store is actually like um

2149
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,960
sorry google maps

2150
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,760
is the one that i still miss very very

2151
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,120
deeply

2152
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,679
and that's why i use their web version

2153
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,199
because it's actually pretty good on the

2154
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,239
web

2155
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:24,080
it's not the best you don't get turn by

2156
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,920
turn directions

2157
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,960
but

2158
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,679
if you go to maps.google.com

2159
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:34,199
[Music]

2160
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,120
you can actually pin

2161
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,520
google maps to um oh yeah same you have

2162
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,639
to

2163
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,480
you have to agree they got me guys they

2164
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,400
got me i'm accepting their terms because

2165
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,440
i like google maps

2166
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,719
but you see

2167
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:51,040
it was a choice i let them in

2168
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,239
it wasn't uh it wasn't a blockade

2169
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:56,000
telling me you're not allowed to have

2170
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,400
your phone unless you click this yes

2171
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,239
button it was me

2172
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:03,360
deciding i made an active choice right

2173
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,280
then

2174
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,480
to accept

2175
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,800
google services

2176
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,800
so i can have google maps

2177
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,260
so

2178
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:12,560
[Music]

2179
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,400
yeah i'm going to

2180
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,800
oh yeah here it is install and when it

2181
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,480
says install what that really means is

2182
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,679
put a shortcut on my desktop

2183
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:23,840
so now yeah i sort of have google maps

2184
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,360
on my phone now

2185
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,080
which is just a web browser that does

2186
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,600
one and one thing only which is go to

2187
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,199
google maps

2188
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:34,480
but it's not bad

2189
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,639
oh yeah yeah i use youtube on the web as

2190
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:37,840
well

2191
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,280
i um

2192
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,719
i still log in

2193
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,239
i still log into youtube i like the

2194
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:43,840
recommendations and i like the lack of

2195
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,960
ads

2196
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,880
i used to use an ad blocker on youtube

2197
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:48,719
but they're it's kind of a cat and mouse

2198
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,239
game where every time a new ad blocker

2199
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:53,760
comes out google has to you know kill it

2200
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,199
so

2201
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:58,080
i i personally like to sign in

2202
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,199
to i sign in through firefox

2203
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,360
and i let firefox

2204
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,360
fight the battle for me as far as

2205
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,679
maintaining my digital privacy

2206
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:10,880
and firefox also has containers

2207
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,900
which allow you to at least jail

2208
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:15,520
[Music]

2209
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,920
you can put a jail around different apps

2210
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,239
i have a container for facebook

2211
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:22,480
i have a container for school

2212
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,460
and i have a container for um

2213
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:27,560
[Music]

2214
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,000
well i guess that's really it but and i

2215
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,360
actually don't see containers in the web

2216
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,960
version so i only do it on the desktop

2217
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,960
version i guess but the point is i i go

2218
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,840
to the firefox for everything

2219
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,400
they're the ones i i um decide to trust

2220
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,280
i never install chrome

2221
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:45,780
so

2222
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,920
[Music]

2223
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,239
yeah

2224
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:54,600
any other questions

2225
01:24:54,600 --> 01:25:01,199
[Music]

2226
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:05,040
which chat app do i recommend

2227
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,600
that's a good one

2228
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,239
uh i use them all actually so um

2229
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,560
the one that's nearest and dearest to my

2230
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,080
heart

2231
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:16,960
is

2232
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,679
signal

2233
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:22,679
s-i-g-n-a-l

2234
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,679
i don't know if they're in here

2235
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:29,840
i think you can actually download signal

2236
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,080
directly don't quote me on that

2237
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,280
[Music]

2238
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,280
but

2239
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:40,640
[Music]

2240
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,080
let's see yeah signal home

2241
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:45,679
download let's see if they'll just serve

2242
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:48,480
me a download

2243
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,120
now it goes to the google play store

2244
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,400
yeah get used to not seeing that

2245
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,360
yep

2246
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,199
yep

2247
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,120
so the other one is telegram

2248
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,400
i like telegram as well

2249
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,199
and i don't see them in here either i

2250
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:09,040
always check f droid to see if the app i

2251
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,040
want is in here first and oh look oh my

2252
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,080
god

2253
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,560
telegrams in here

2254
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,660
i forgot they have a floss version

2255
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:18,639
[Music]

2256
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:19,760
yes

2257
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,360
look at that it even gets love it was

2258
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,600
updated three weeks ago they actually

2259
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,440
update telegram so all right so i

2260
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,840
revised my prior statement i no longer

2261
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,400
love signal i love telegram now

2262
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,570
because they publish on android

2263
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:34,000
[Music]

2264
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,600
i love apps that are published on f

2265
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,360
droid because they don't come with any

2266
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,120
strings

2267
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,080
they generally don't come with ads

2268
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,440
and

2269
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,719
it's

2270
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:46,560
it's just better it's a better way to

2271
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,400
live they're not constantly after your

2272
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,239
money

2273
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:52,480
it's just software that belongs to the

2274
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,400
community

2275
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,480
and you use it

2276
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,360
so

2277
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,000
telegram is the one i now love the most

2278
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,679
but again i use them all whenever i

2279
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:04,960
don't see it in f droid i go to aurora

2280
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,400
and i can tell you right now one of the

2281
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,840
first things i'm going to need is

2282
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,480
discord

2283
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,560
and yeah i

2284
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,800
i use discord i like it a lot because

2285
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,719
all my friends are there i don't know

2286
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:18,480
how much they respect my privacy but i

2287
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,719
know i love my friends

2288
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:23,199
so i download and use discord and i

2289
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:25,120
don't notice any differences when using

2290
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,120
this app

2291
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,360
uh problem for me with the chrome

2292
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,199
wallets extension

2293
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:32,080
oh

2294
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,600
yeah

2295
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,920
are they arriving in brave i don't i

2296
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,679
don't actually use a digital wallet on

2297
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,840
my phone so i have absolutely zero

2298
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,159
experience with that

2299
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,000
i don't see why it technically couldn't

2300
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,360
work

2301
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:49,040
but if it's a google exclusive service

2302
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,800
i would almost expect it to not work

2303
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,960
unless a browser

2304
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,360
can provide that functionality

2305
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,400
entirely which i'm kind of doubtful

2306
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,400
if i'm honest i wouldn't get my hopes up

2307
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,960
about having a digital wallet

2308
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,440
but try it i mean there's nothing wrong

2309
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,280
with trying

2310
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:08,960
see if it works and if it works that's a

2311
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,440
victory and if it doesn't um maybe

2312
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,480
politely ask somebody

2313
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,719
if they're willing to show you how to

2314
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,880
make it work and we'll see if anyone

2315
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:22,000
else oh speaking of asking people

2316
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,280
um

2317
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,920
asteroid i'm sorry not f droid lineage

2318
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:28,639
has community people and they actually

2319
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:31,920
have at the bottom of every instructions

2320
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,080
is a get existence right if you get

2321
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,040
stuck

2322
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,880
ask our subreddit

2323
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,520
or they have a chat

2324
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,480
the subreddit's pretty good

2325
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,360
you can ask questions on their subreddit

2326
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,040
and

2327
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:54,159
i don't know what libra is

2328
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:58,320
i'm sure it's nice but yeah

2329
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,760
so yeah crypto wallets are principally

2330
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:02,880

2331
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,639
