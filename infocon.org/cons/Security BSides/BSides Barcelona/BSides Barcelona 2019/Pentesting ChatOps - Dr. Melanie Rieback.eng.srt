1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:09,950
so thank you for coming uh what I'm

2
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:12,170
going to present today is a updated

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,440
version actually of a presentation that

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:18,470
I also gave previously at besides in Las

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,420
Vegas so I'm going to be talking today

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,869
of course about penetration testing but

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:27,770
also about chat ops who here knows what

8
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:29,869
chat Ops is raise your hands okay about

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,550
half the people good well you'll know

10
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:34,489
what it is by the time this presentation

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:38,469
is finished so see how do I actually

12
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:42,379
change the slide yeah oh that works

13
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:48,139
great so we're gonna start with the

14
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:49,789
question what is chat ops so chat ups is

15
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:52,850
a concept that I

16
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:55,549
well mostly gratuitous to retort ously

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:58,280
stole from the company github so we all

18
00:00:55,549 --> 00:01:02,089
know and love github of course they

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,400
created a chat bot called Hugh bot so

20
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:05,900
who here has ever used to you but raise

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,540
your hand okay

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,580
smaller number of hands so Hugh bot is

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,740
an open source project and it's a chat

24
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:17,179
bot it's basically very similar to like

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,919
an old school IRC but yeah so except for

26
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,130
the fact that it tends to run in more

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,990
modern chat rooms so I'm sure most of

28
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,580
you here probably use slack or something

29
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,669
similar raise your hand if you use

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,800
something similar to slack okay so at

31
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,250
radically open security we use a

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,940
open-source self hosted version of slack

33
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,550
called

34
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:41,120
rocket jet here has ever heard of rocket

35
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:44,509
jet yeah alright I highly recommend it

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,700
by the way uh you know I don't really

37
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,140
trust slack you know it's probably only

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,900
a matter of time before they're acquired

39
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,690
by some Google Facebook whatever you

40
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,780
know and of course there is no cloud

41
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:59,270
there only is other people's computers

42
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,159
so yeah so and especially when you're

43
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,690
dealing with customers pen test data I

44
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,210
can tell you that I don't trust that

45
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,530
kind of stuff to select cloud and to be

46
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,208
quite honest I don't think you should

47
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,629
either

48
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:14,629
but that being said um so we use rocket

49
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:16,750
jet and this is basically a screenshot

50
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:18,790
sorry it's a little bit fuzzy

51
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,299
with the projector but this is a

52
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:26,260
screenshot of what our chat room looks

53
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:27,519
like with with rocket Jets and yeah can

54
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,060
you guys make this a little sharper by

55
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:34,239
any chance no it is what it is okay if

56
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:37,180
you were able to read this text what you

57
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,849
would see is that I typed in a command

58
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,299
called Ross pot hug me

59
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:45,518
okay so Ross pot is the name of our chat

60
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:49,060
bot so raw spot for a radically open

61
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,000
security okay and pug me okay so this is

62
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,440
an example of one command that we can do

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,370
using our chat bot

64
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,629
so these trap commands essentially are

65
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,340
providing any number of different

66
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:02,950
commands that you can carry out as a

67
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,359
penetration tester pug me of course it's

68
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,510
like one of the most useless commands

69
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:12,160
that exists you type in Ross but pug me

70
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,599
and you get back a pug yeah I mean not

71
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,250
really useful but definitely you know

72
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,480
firfer sort of like cultural development

73
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,640
of your company in this kind of stuff is

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,790
great at one point in time I think we

75
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,440
installed the cards against humanity'

76
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:28,930
but anyway so yeah so there's a whole

77
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,389
lot of far more useful commands that we

78
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,160
also can do via the chat bot and

79
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:35,230
essentially what you're doing with chat

80
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,319
ups is you are actually turning your

81
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:40,599
chat room into a kind of command line I

82
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,208
mean kind of like a UNIX command line so

83
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,858
it's like making the chat your command

84
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:47,980
and control center for your entire

85
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:51,190
pentesting operations and that is a

86
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:54,160
super powerful thing which then brings

87
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,290
us into the actual description of

88
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,510
pentesting chat ops and again my

89
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:02,290
apologies for I have never seen the

90
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:04,239
quality this horrible ever but I'll have

91
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,340
to explain basically what's on here so

92
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,590
if you were able to read this what you

93
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,739
would see as you would see that I am

94
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:15,190
compiling a PDF of a penetration test

95
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:18,880
report so you know reporting it's a

96
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,469
necessary evil developers hate it pen

97
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,050
testers hate it pretty much everybody

98
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,729
hates it and like every pen testing

99
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,580
company in the universe we have

100
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:29,409
developed a framework to essentially

101
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,599
automate all of the most boring bits

102
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:34,259
away

103
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:38,009
so it is worth mentioning that we have

104
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,449
open sourced our entire framework for

105
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:42,209
everything I'm describing today by the

106
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:45,539
way and not only have we open sourced it

107
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:47,939
but we have made it an a wasp project so

108
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:53,188
if you google it or DuckDuckGo it or

109
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:56,639
whatnot look for a wasp pen text so this

110
00:04:53,189 --> 00:05:00,689
is the system that I'm talking about so

111
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,469
but what we do is that the core of it

112
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:07,189
really is a pen test documentation

113
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:10,498
automation framework so we're taking xml

114
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:13,529
templates and compiling them using XSLT

115
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:14,550
stylesheets into pretty PDFs which then

116
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,930
of course we can deliver to our

117
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,080
customers and hopefully they're gonna

118
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:23,039
they're gonna love oh the way that we do

119
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:28,409
it is basically I use raw spot I use our

120
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:31,889
chat bot to be able to actually execute

121
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:35,729
the command to compile the report so if

122
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:37,409
you were able to see this actually I

123
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:38,938
think in this example is a little fuzzy

124
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:39,990
i I can't read it either but it looks

125
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:44,069
like we're actually compiling a

126
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:47,240
quotation not not a report but I believe

127
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:52,229
that it says a raw spot quickscope off

128
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,509
dot well basically customer name and so

129
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:55,919
what happens is first we fill in so for

130
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:57,899
we're creating quotations for our

131
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,659
customers we fill in an A for s worth of

132
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:02,819
XML then we do this quick scope and then

133
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:05,669
that expands the a for s worth of XML

134
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:07,169
into a longer XML file containing all

135
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,969
the boilerplate you know and all the

136
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:13,079
stuff that we would need the next

137
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:17,759
command that I'm doing via the chat bot

138
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:21,959
is I am saying raw spots build quote and

139
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,519
again oh ffs - customer name Oh ffs yeah

140
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,740
I apologize were a Dutch company the

141
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,589
Dutch word for quotation is feta we

142
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:31,889
never really got that out of out of our

143
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:33,659
system but but basically that's sort of

144
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:36,389
the the naming scheme we use internally

145
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:39,479
for distinguishing quotations from pen

146
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:42,269
tests pen test reports nonetheless this

147
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:44,289
build commands at that point is invoking

148
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:46,680
the entire back end tool

149
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,810
that then is taking that XML file

150
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,340
compiling it using the style sheets and

151
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,010
then essentially spitting out a

152
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,690
clickable link to a PDF file and again

153
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,390
sorry it's not readable but what you can

154
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,580
see is that blue line that's kind of

155
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:03,789
fuzzy there that actually is a clickable

156
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:07,690
URL to the PDF file now the really nice

157
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:11,440
thing is everybody in this chatroom can

158
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:13,510
essentially see you know that PDF link

159
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,880
that was just clicked out that was just

160
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,430
spit out by the chat bot so basically

161
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,710
you know a command invoked by one member

162
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,380
of our pen testing staff also can be

163
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,169
viewed by everybody else who happens to

164
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,090
be in that chat room so now is a good

165
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:31,240
time to mention that at radically open

166
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:34,419
security we have a really unusual way of

167
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:39,280
pen testing that we call peek over our

168
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:41,140
shoulder so what this is I in the past

169
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,330
have rails a little bit against the lack

170
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:47,560
of openness and transparency in the pen

171
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:50,890
testing process usually perpetrated by

172
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,260
big commercial companies so I come up

173
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,240
with a new workflow for pen testing that

174
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,980
really tried to involve the customer

175
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,410
more and to optimize for knowledge

176
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:02,410
transfer so what we do at radically open

177
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:05,820
security is we actually invite the

178
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:08,530
customers to join us in the chat rooms

179
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:11,920
so this is actually really quite kind of

180
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:14,849
interesting because while we radically

181
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,830
open security we happen to be a 100%

182
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:21,190
online company ok

183
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,840
so all of my staff works remotely I have

184
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,670
a critical mass of staff and the

185
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,380
Netherlands of course because we started

186
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:29,800
in Amsterdam but I've also got a lot of

187
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:32,409
German hackers for example CCC of course

188
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,200
but we've also got penetration testers

189
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,569
in Australia we've also got pen testers

190
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,360
in India we've also got pen testers in

191
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:43,030
Latin America I just hired recently some

192
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,060
people in South Africa so I mean when we

193
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:50,370
say we are a global team we really are a

194
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:53,619
global team however this actually has

195
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,720
advantages and what this means is that

196
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,460
all of the communication of all of my

197
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,160
team members happens

198
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:05,710
this chat room so essentially the chat

199
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:10,600
room is our office but then what we do

200
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:13,720
is we invite customers to join us in our

201
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,730
chat rooms so what that means is it's

202
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,700
basically inviting the customers into

203
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,850
our office so then during the course of

204
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:25,180
an engagement the customers can overhear

205
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,740
every single conversation that our

206
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,920
penetration testers are having

207
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,620
throughout the course of an engagement

208
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,569
needless to say they love this the other

209
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,360
thing also is when we're making use of

210
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,610
chat ops commands via the chat bot they

211
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,790
can also see this too so if one of my

212
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,760
penetration testers uses the raw spot

213
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,640
builds command and we get a PDF link for

214
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,339
a pen test report spit out the customer

215
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,529
can immediately click on it so this is

216
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:56,020
really powerful so what it does is it

217
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:58,570
really assists with making a very tight

218
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:01,149
and fast feedback loop with your

219
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:07,330
customers which of course has a number

220
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:09,490
of really great advantages so yeah

221
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,610
so pen text itself I mean you can

222
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,550
basically find bits of it in gitlab are

223
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:18,640
sorry in github also more recently we

224
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:21,699
have also put a lot of our chat pod code

225
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,589
into gitlab this has also been because

226
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,420
we've been integrating it with git lab

227
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,100
CI because we're actually in the middle

228
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,529
right now of doing a big DevOps

229
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,930
refactoring on our code to try and make

230
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:33,850
it easier to deploy with

231
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,189
containerization and everything but

232
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,630
there's documentation if you were able

233
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,910
to read this you would see that this is

234
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,250
what the an example of what an XML

235
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,779
template looks like it then compiles via

236
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,060
the chat bot into something that looks

237
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:48,400
like a bug standard pen test report

238
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,050
pretty much but of course because this

239
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,910
is open source you can basically take

240
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,709
this adopt it yourself

241
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,529
steal it that's what open source is for

242
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:58,270
replace the logo replace the company

243
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:00,700
name and you two can use it for

244
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:05,980
generating your own pen test reports

245
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,990
automatically um oh man this is hard to

246
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,640
read so

247
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:15,410
oh this looks like the same slide as

248
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:19,260
before all right so we internally use

249
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:21,780
gitlab this so we kind of have a bit of

250
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,680
a trifecta of software that we tend to

251
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:30,300
use within radically open security so we

252
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:34,140
have a rocket jet we have get lab and

253
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:38,939
then we also have well basically all the

254
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:41,580
bits with the with a chat bot we used to

255
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,680
use can board for project management

256
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,110
purposes but at a certain point actually

257
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,900
phased it out because well people didn't

258
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,400
like clicking sorry like cultural quirk

259
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,590
of my company nobody wants to take their

260
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,470
hands off the keyboard but you get that

261
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:57,120
with hackers button like okay so we're

262
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,250
doing the majority of that actually if

263
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,640
you have a command line now as well but

264
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:05,360
this is an example of how the structure

265
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,340
of the pen test report looks in gitlab

266
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,450
the workflow that we have actually is

267
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:14,730
that the pen testers document the

268
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:19,260
findings but also the the notes in get

269
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:23,520
lab so we use get lab issues so every

270
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:25,860
time a penetration tester updates an

271
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,300
issue in get lab for example saying you

272
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,460
know we just tried this and this and

273
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,339
this or otherwise if they are pushing

274
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,500
for example let's say they ran some scan

275
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,080
and they're pushing the the file with

276
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,340
the scan results into the repository

277
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:42,270
every single time this get lab

278
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:45,540
repository is updated the chat bot spits

279
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:49,079
out a update in the chat room that says

280
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,790
this pen tester just did this at this

281
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,150
timestamp click here for more

282
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,250
information this is also really nice for

283
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,770
the customers you know because what it

284
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,180
is is actually without any extra work on

285
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,430
the pen testers part we're actually

286
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,689
giving the customer a kind of

287
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:09,120
blow-by-blow update on exactly what our

288
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,520
pen testers are doing at any moment in

289
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,210
time and again like a well-informed

290
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,710
customer tends to be a happy customer

291
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,720
there's other really nice things by the

292
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:21,460
way about including your customers in

293
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,580
the process in this way shape and form

294
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:28,610
you know for the purposes of crystal box

295
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,040
pen testing but this is super efficient

296
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,720
because essentially a lot of people tend

297
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,910
to ask the question yeah that isn't

298
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,190
having the customer in your chat room

299
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,719
annoying like aren't they always asking

300
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,040
questions and getting in your way and

301
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,560
you know requiring too much explanation

302
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,390
yeah I get this question a lot but the

303
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,670
truth of the matter is it's actually

304
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:49,160
annoying for us not having an active

305
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,260
customer there and the reason why is

306
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,860
because basically the customer is an

307
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,839
Oracle for us so anytime we have

308
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,510
questions like for example what does

309
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,850
this function do or you know why is this

310
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,650
code path like this or you know we just

311
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,050
did something did it create a file on

312
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,029
your server can you check or are you

313
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,959
using a complex password here so you

314
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:10,910
know we want to know if it's worth

315
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,339
running the password crack or hummus you

316
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,170
know having the customer there actually

317
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:17,029
is really really nice you know other

318
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,349
things like can you reboot the server or

319
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:21,140
we're having problems getting this to

320
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:23,570
compile and basically what we do is we

321
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:27,170
invite the customer to invite actually

322
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,850
as many developers sidman's and devops

323
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,990
folks basically anybody involved with

324
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,060
the product or service that we're

325
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,570
testing to actually join us in the

326
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,369
chatroom

327
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,740
to sort of you know join the party for

328
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,910
us it doesn't even matter so for us it's

329
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,390
kind of like you know the more the

330
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,230
merrier

331
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:44,569
there is OPSEC of course who which I'll

332
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,000
get to a bit later but but nonetheless

333
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,890
for us I mean operationally speaking

334
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,210
it's not more difficult for us having 10

335
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,670
people in the chat room than it is

336
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:56,120
having two people another thing that it

337
00:14:52,670 --> 00:15:00,050
also enables us to do is allow the

338
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:03,280
customers even sometimes to invite their

339
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,750
vendors to join us surprisingly enough

340
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,949
and this would sound like a really odd

341
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,060
thing like why would you want the

342
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,500
vendors in your chatting room while

343
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,390
you're doing a pen test but if it turns

344
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,490
out actually that the vendor is involved

345
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,100
with either hosting or building whatever

346
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,779
the thing is that you're testing it

347
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,339
actually is super useful because again

348
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:21,620
it's like a second set of Oracle's that

349
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:23,330
you have in the chat room on top of this

350
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,310
it actually helps to improve the

351
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,839
relationship between the customer and

352
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,130
the vendor strangely enough because

353
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,650
they're kind of working together and

354
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,900
collaborating on this and also from the

355
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,740
point of view of a pen test company this

356
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,600
is also beneficial because

357
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,120
I have to say sometimes those those

358
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,710
vendors who got invited to work with a

359
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,780
peek over our shoulder actually became

360
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,400
direct customers of ours later just

361
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,930
because they saw what we were doing and

362
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,699
like the workflow so much that they

363
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,620
decided they wanted to try us so for

364
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,990
their own pen test next time so there's

365
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:57,510
a whole lot of win really and doing

366
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:59,790
things this way so what you have here is

367
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,160
a it's a screenshot from a github

368
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,719
repository of another open-source tool

369
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,770
that we built that was called the

370
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,840
passive scanning tool so this was a tool

371
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:14,250
that we had built as an assignment for

372
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:18,030
si DN which is the company that owns the

373
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,620
dot ml TLD and I'm allowed to talk about

374
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,020
this because we the report is published

375
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:26,190
but we wrote essentially a tool that

376
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:29,040
took the output of showed on and scans

377
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:33,150
not i/o and I think one other thing and

378
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,370
basically bundles all of these both the

379
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,650
output together and just spin it out in

380
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,020
a concise way so we could do passive

381
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,970
scanning so this tool also has been open

382
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,699
sourced but the interesting part about

383
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:48,150
this is this tool then also can be

384
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,500
integrated into the chat bot so this is

385
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,060
actually really nice because you can

386
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,470
actually start taking a lot of the

387
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,569
different kinds of tools that you use

388
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:57,840
frequently and then starting to slowly

389
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:02,580
integrate that you know into this kind

390
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:04,560
of like single command line so you know

391
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,730
what other kinds of things actually can

392
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:10,260
we do using the chat bot so another

393
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:13,260
formula that we really really enjoy

394
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:18,869
doing with our customers is what we call

395
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:21,810
a red blue pen test so what we do is we

396
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:24,089
take a group of developers so software

397
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:27,089
developers system administrators and

398
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:29,909
DevOps folks okay so let's say we have a

399
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:33,389
dozen of them what we do is we gamify

400
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:35,610
their pen test and we actually split

401
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,950
them into two teams so we'll have say

402
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:40,199
either a red team and a blue team of say

403
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,840
six and six people or we can also do it

404
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:48,270
with a red team and red team what then

405
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:52,860
happens is these two teams compete

406
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:54,690
on hacking their own stuff and what we

407
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,689
have done is we have actually created

408
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,610
our own scoreboard application so that

409
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,320
at the end of every day of this kind of

410
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,330
you know CTF competition where they're

411
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,159
hacking their own products then you can

412
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,870
see for example and sorry again this is

413
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,480
fuzzy but right here I typed in a

414
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:11,310
command called good job blue and then

415
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,700
Ross spot then at that point says

416
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:16,470
incremented blue 24 points and then that

417
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,890
spits out some motivational image which

418
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,660
of course geeks love but I mean it

419
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,030
really allows us you know in the same

420
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,920
integrated command line to be able to

421
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,780
put actually all kinds of applications

422
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,290
you know that you might need for all

423
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:34,170
different kinds of assignments with our

424
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:36,090
customers so this this all is is really

425
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:38,760
super cool the nice thing by the way

426
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,040
about the red blue pen tests is it

427
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,020
really takes the developers out of their

428
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,139
usual position of developing for you

429
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,480
know a few days to a week and they're

430
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,600
really looking at their own stuff from

431
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,520
the eyes of an attacker the number one

432
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,139
comments that we get after doing red

433
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:01,220
blue pen tests is and I quote I will

434
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:09,600
never look at code the same way again

435
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:11,760
and this is why we do it so what other

436
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,889
kinds of things actually can we

437
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,230
integrate into this single unified

438
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:19,140
command line well it turns out there's a

439
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,690
lot of different things I mean start by

440
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:25,830
thinking about scanning tools like take

441
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:29,970
an map for example and map is handy in

442
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:32,970
the sense that it allows us to get

443
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,380
output from the tool in XML format that

444
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,330
actually is a really easy for a well

445
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,850
easy one for us because if we're then

446
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:41,189
using XML for our pen test reports

447
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,780
themselves then integrating bits of XML

448
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,210
directly from our scanning tools

449
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,530
actually helps us you know to make

450
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,560
things quite a bit faster and quite a

451
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:52,950
bit more efficient so this this much we

452
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:56,190
already have integrated into into raw

453
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:59,460
spot other scanning tools that possibly

454
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,960
could be integrated while still right

455
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,029
now we're still using it by hand but we

456
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,119
could is

457
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:06,979
essentially things like w3 AF sequel map

458
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,408
essentially any kinds of scanning tools

459
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:13,759
that you might run on some kind of

460
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:15,889
infrastructure Hydra so a brute-forcing

461
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,559
yeah I mean this is another thing also

462
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:22,758
that we can invoke via the command line

463
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:26,119
and why not reconnaissance so things

464
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:28,099
like who is google has a passive

465
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,809
scanning tool I told you about before

466
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:32,090
I mean we've also got DuckDuckGo

467
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:34,879
implemented in that I think at one point

468
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:36,619
we put can I google that for you in

469
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:40,699
there anyway

470
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:43,189
other things like hash cracking now this

471
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,440
is super cool what we've done is we have

472
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,690
actually built some rainbow tables and

473
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,639
put the rainbow tables on our back-end

474
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:55,009
server the nice thing is we can actually

475
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:57,289
invoke a hash cracker that makes use of

476
00:20:55,009 --> 00:21:01,639
these rainbow tables and we can invoke

477
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:04,190
this via the chat how cool is that

478
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:07,609
but another really nice thing about this

479
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:09,950
is because we're using a web front-end

480
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:12,019
for this basically it means that I can

481
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,330
use this full set of hacking tools that

482
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:15,979
we have available

483
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:18,710
essentially with any kind of device that

484
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:21,830
has a web browser so what that means is

485
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,269
if for example I'm sitting in a bus you

486
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,029
know traveling to some godforsaken

487
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:27,889
corner of the country that I live in

488
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:30,440
what I can do is I can actually take out

489
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:32,508
my cell phone and I can actually launch

490
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,969
you know I can basically crack

491
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:41,119
somebody's password using rainbow tables

492
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:43,159
from my cell phone how cool is that you

493
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,949
know and it actually really helps I mean

494
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:48,200
for for being efficient because I mean

495
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:50,450
of course there's auth but there has to

496
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,589
be there's multiple layers of off you

497
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,710
know and this is another thing that we

498
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:57,619
that we take seriously and we have to

499
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:59,299
but what it does mean is basically you

500
00:21:57,619 --> 00:22:00,799
know it makes it allows you to be really

501
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,929
flexible with the form factors of the

502
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,729
device that you're using another nice

503
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:07,519
thing also is that it makes system

504
00:22:04,729 --> 00:22:10,399
administration of the tool set really

505
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,739
really easy because basically there is a

506
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:15,120
single server that is running the

507
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:19,950
necessary tools that we need

508
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:22,080
Ross pot and then um let's say you you

509
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,570
hire a new pen tester and you have to

510
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,159
onboard this new staff member so with

511
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:30,510
most companies you know on day one you

512
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,360
know the first thing is always you know

513
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:34,710
issuing new laptops and you know trying

514
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,459
to get all the accounts set up and

515
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,020
things like that

516
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,030
well for us it's actually far easier

517
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,360
because all we really have to do is

518
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,580
arrange that they have off you know

519
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:48,419
basically to be able to get in and at

520
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:50,820
that point everything is set up right so

521
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:56,130
it actually makes onboarding new folks

522
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:58,830
super easy you know similarly also with

523
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,990
customers again I'm talking about off

524
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,580
quite a lot but but do keep in mind that

525
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,350
because a lot of these commands are

526
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:08,250
there and a lot of these commands are

527
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:10,980
powerful we also have basically access

528
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:13,559
control lists that control which user

529
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,960
accounts are actually able to do which

530
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,629
commands because of course we don't want

531
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,480
our customers running you know hash

532
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,460
cracking tools you know via our command

533
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,040
line and trust me like a lot of

534
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,480
customers that we onboard I mean the

535
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,850
first thing that they do is they try and

536
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,580
hack us or they try and doing do doing

537
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,469
something that they they're not supposed

538
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,120
to do which is great because if it's if

539
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,530
they succeed that'd probably be happy to

540
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,270
give them a discount on their pen test

541
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:45,260
so that is to be encouraged but yeah so

542
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:48,540
uh so that that is quite interesting

543
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:50,520
another thing also is with spearfishing

544
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,800
so this is something else that we can do

545
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:59,220
using chat ups that I think is really

546
00:23:52,800 --> 00:24:00,780
quite unique so if we have a spear fit

547
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,940
well not spear fishing but a general

548
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,980
purpose fishing assignment we have

549
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,450
actually built a tool kit that by the

550
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:12,030
way we have also open sourced and with H

551
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,890
one particular chat chat bot command

552
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,470
what we can do is we can actually take

553
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:19,620
either a you know like a mailing list

554
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:22,230
like a text file or a web page we can

555
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,239
actually scrape it and then we can

556
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,510
instrument those links automatically to

557
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:31,530
basically point to our web server

558
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:34,590
and then from there we use the slack API

559
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,450
to basically take the hits on our on our

560
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,149
web server and then inject that

561
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:41,580
basically in to our chat so that the

562
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:44,220
Hugh bot then can basically say this

563
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:48,120
email address just clicked on this

564
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,520
pretext name at this timestamp and that

565
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,830
is super cool because again we invite

566
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,900
the customers to be in our chat room so

567
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:57,360
what happens is we you know we can have

568
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,130
like multiple security officers from a

569
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,760
particular customer sitting on our chat

570
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:05,070
room and they can sit there and watch

571
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:09,810
while their own stuff is getting fished

572
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:12,750
in real time you know and we can also do

573
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:16,379
exactly the same with for example web

574
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:18,990
forms so if we create let's say a fake

575
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:20,970
I don't know Windows 365 login and we're

576
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,100
basically just trying to collect the

577
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:26,670
names and passwords that people are

578
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,169
silly enough to fill in the security

579
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,330
officers can actually sit there and

580
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:32,280
watch while people are filling things in

581
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,460
and sometimes actually this is really

582
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,080
quite entertaining there was one

583
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,060
particular time where we were doing a

584
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,060
phishing assignment for a hosting

585
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,889
provider and at a certain point one of

586
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,080
the software developers from the hosting

587
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,880
provider figured out that the domain

588
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,419
name we were using wasn't exactly right

589
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,460
so at a certain point he started playing

590
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,990
with the form so we started like you

591
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,390
know seeing in the chat room you know

592
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,940
sort of strange things happening so at a

593
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:04,520
certain point it's just sort of like

594
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:07,350
username you know nice try assholes

595
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,060
password whatever you know and and and

596
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,120
my personal favorite was he I think it

597
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:18,120
was username woohoo password sequel

598
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:20,010
injection so you know this was actually

599
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,419
really entertaining to watch I mean of

600
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:23,040
course that begs the question was this

601
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:27,330
guy in a sandbox environment while he

602
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,560
was doing this but still you know at

603
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,199
which point the security officers were

604
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,770
just like man lunchtime but thanks for

605
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,510
the good entertainment so yes so this

606
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:39,270
stuff is really cool so the nice thing

607
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:41,400
again with chat ops is not just that you

608
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,080
know it centralizes all the tools

609
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,450
that you're using but it actually allows

610
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,129
you to kind of innovate new experiences

611
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:52,680
you know that your customers can have

612
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:56,370
which is I think pretty cool so uh you

613
00:26:52,680 --> 00:27:00,630
know also for internal stuff we also

614
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:03,090
have hooks into our chat system so you

615
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:06,510
know like every company in the universe

616
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:08,129
we have project management I mean you

617
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,890
know by now we're actually quite a large

618
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,340
company you know I've got about 40 staff

619
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:15,660
members we've had about 80 customers I

620
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,459
now is a good time to mention that we

621
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:21,570
actually are a preferred supplier for

622
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:23,310
Google also for Mozilla in the Maas

623
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,889
program if you guys know we do a lot of

624
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,929
open-source audits for that open tech

625
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,710
fund but also you know banks insurance

626
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:33,200
companies hosting providers telcos etc

627
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:36,240
but that's not the point the point is

628
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,770
because we have so much going on we have

629
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,160
project management tools that we need

630
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:42,629
for managing that the problem with

631
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,370
project management tools is if you

632
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,290
expect the pen testers to actually do

633
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,629
anything good luck with that

634
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,980
I mean pen testers are lazy so if you

635
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,560
basically say you know when you're done

636
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,840
could you please you know move the you

637
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,760
know item on the canned board you know

638
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,080
from this to done I mean if you ask your

639
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,050
pen testers to do it they just want to

640
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,929
do it because that's pen testers but

641
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:06,570
instead what you can do is you can try

642
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:09,540
and get them to update stuff sort of by

643
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:14,399
side effect so we use this particular

644
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:17,070
chat command that is called Ross pot

645
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,220
ship it so who here knows what the ship

646
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:23,370
at squirrel is raise your hand one

647
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,500
person okay two people okay so basically

648
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:28,979
this is another one of these incredibly

649
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:31,740
useless commands that the Hugh bot makes

650
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,470
available you what you do is you put in

651
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:37,830
the chat command ship it basically

652
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:39,720
anywhere in your in your chat you know

653
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,020
and then you submit it and then it spits

654
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,640
a squirrel like a picture of a squirrel

655
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,200
so it's kind of useless but but it's

656
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,460
like really cute squirrels and sometimes

657
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,840
they're wearing armor and sometimes

658
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,730
they're on boats and like you know has

659
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,639
any way maybe they sometimes they're in

660
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,720
a tree but geeks like this you know

661
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,820
because as

662
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,530
if you're shipping say a pen test report

663
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,299
or a quotation I mean it's nice to have

664
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:02,399
some kind of little ritual for being

665
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,658
able to celebrate victories right you

666
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,909
know that that's good for the morale of

667
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:09,480
your company but we've rigged it as such

668
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:12,090
that when people type in raw spot

669
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,130
ship it and they get the squirrel it

670
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:17,549
automatically takes that can board item

671
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:19,440
and it moves it to done see that's

672
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:21,900
that's a way to get like lazy pen

673
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,210
testers to do stuff so just to kind of

674
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:28,080
make it fun so you know so this is

675
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:31,350
actually really nice we've also got our

676
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:35,100
own support desk software that we've

677
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:37,678
developed ourselves called get notes so

678
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,658
again we tend not to use drag and drop

679
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,120
too much within the company just because

680
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,020
our you know we've tried it trust me

681
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,879
we've tried to learn a different

682
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,049
open-source software packages we throw a

683
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,880
lot of things against the wall to see

684
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:48,840
what sticks and anything where people

685
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,320
have to take their hands off the

686
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,299
keyboard almost never sticks so

687
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,460
basically we came up with our own

688
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:59,100
support desk software that works

689
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:03,390
entirely via the chat so what happens is

690
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:05,010
we have magic email addresses that tend

691
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:07,770
to be you know some things like you know

692
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:10,470
a project name slash well customer name

693
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:14,820
slash project name at magical email

694
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:17,280
address and then what happens is that so

695
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,799
the chat bot at that point spits out an

696
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,350
announcement of when new emails arrived

697
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:25,230
that contained that magical email

698
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:29,370
address so what happens is the copy of

699
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:31,559
that email is automatically put into the

700
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,719
git lab repository that corresponds to

701
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:36,120
that particular assignment and then Hugh

702
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,820
bot says you know an email with from

703
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,530
this sender with this subject name just

704
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,110
arrived at this timestamp please click

705
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:46,049
here to see it this is actually really

706
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:49,020
handy because sometimes we work with

707
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:51,750
customers on multiple projects and their

708
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,150
security officers want us to keep them

709
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:57,059
abreast of the correspondence that we're

710
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:58,799
having with our project teams so what's

711
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:01,080
really nice about this as as long as

712
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,110
this magical email address is being see

713
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,820
seed or bc seed then again automatically

714
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:07,870
we're going to get these announcements

715
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:11,950
in the channel so as long as the

716
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:13,959
security officers are basically in in

717
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,910
those channels you know that that are

718
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,559
involved with their own company and to

719
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:19,750
be honest we've also written scripts to

720
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:21,760
automatically add you know these

721
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,160
security officers to every new chat room

722
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,290
that is created that is for their

723
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,730
particular company that basically we can

724
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,500
keep them completely abreast on the

725
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,320
correspondence that's happening without

726
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,840
a single bit of extra work this is

727
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,360
really nice so again this is sort of the

728
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,760
power of what you can do with with chat

729
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:44,559
ops we've also got another command

730
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:47,080
that's called raw spot charge so okay as

731
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,570
a consultancy company the bane of like

732
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,460
every security consultant is declaring

733
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:54,070
their hours you know everybody hates

734
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,970
this we've tried to make it as painless

735
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:57,820
as possible

736
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,950
so what we do is we created this command

737
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,470
called raw spot charge so a particular

738
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:05,320
pen tester can just say raw spot charge

739
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:07,330
n you know for the number of hours and

740
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,540
then a really brief one-line description

741
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,649
of what they just did then raw spot says

742
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,200
you know thank you

743
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:17,260
name of pen tester you had just charged

744
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:22,120
n hours with this description you now

745
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:25,690
have you know em - n hours less left in

746
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,610
this pen test that that is like you know

747
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,290
this percent of the pen test and then

748
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,540
like a progress bar you know showing

749
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:35,200
like the percent that's left in the pen

750
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:37,090
test now that is super handy because it

751
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,860
actually allows us in the course of the

752
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,750
pen test as people are declaring their

753
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,219
hours to actually see how much time is

754
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,170
remaining and of course one of the

755
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,120
challenges of working on pen tests is of

756
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:48,100
course scoping and while you're doing

757
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,290
the work trying to stay within the scope

758
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,120
and this is actually really nice and

759
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:54,190
also from the point of view of the

760
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,939
customers they also really like this way

761
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,210
of doing it

762
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,429
because it gives them transparency into

763
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:02,530
seeing exactly where their money is

764
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:05,590
going because you know in security

765
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:07,720
consultancy time is money so if they can

766
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,889
see exactly where the time is going then

767
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,250
they know exactly what they're paying

768
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,230
for

769
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,809
so customers really really appreciate

770
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:15,790
this kind of transparency another thing

771
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:18,160
that's really nice about it is let's say

772
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:19,960
you scoped wrong you know that happens

773
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,230
sometimes you know we've gotten better

774
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,600
with scoping but we still make

775
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,360
some errors sometimes what it means is

776
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,939
if there is a scoping error the

777
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,350
customers can see it coming from like

778
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:36,290
two miles away so what that means is

779
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:38,389
around the 50% point of the test you can

780
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:40,549
then say well you know dear customer

781
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:42,890
we've just reached the 50% point of this

782
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:44,960
pen test you know we've done XYZ that

783
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:47,240
you know was in our quotation but you

784
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,559
know there's still a BC left to left to

785
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,049
do we don't think it's gonna fit into

786
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,290
the remaining time so dear customer can

787
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:56,270
you please help us to prioritize so we

788
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:58,370
can make sure that out of a and a B and

789
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:00,860
C that you can help us select which of

790
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,689
these things are most important you know

791
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:05,689
and then the rest can get put in as

792
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:07,970
future work now customers really like

793
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,879
this because a it eliminates the

794
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:13,070
surprise factor you know and one of the

795
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,069
easiest ways to upset your customers is

796
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:17,510
to have well unpleasant surprises you

797
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,460
know and and really the more openness

798
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,020
and transparency you have the more they

799
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,440
see these kinds of unpleasant surprises

800
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:26,389
coming so this is actually really

801
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,030
practical and useful for expectation

802
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:31,129
management they also it also gives the

803
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,480
customer some knobs to turn you know on

804
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:34,129
making some decisions about what to

805
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,080
prioritize and this is another thing

806
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:38,989
that tends to make customer is really

807
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,929
quite happy so you know other things

808
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:43,908
that we have integrated into our chat

809
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:49,730
system are things like role based access

810
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:52,760
control so we do have particular teams

811
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:56,659
and particular roles so our company is

812
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,520
managed in a decentralized fashion we

813
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:00,890
use a system that is somewhat similar to

814
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,480
Halak recei I don't know if any of you

815
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,160
guys are familiar with holacracy but

816
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,650
it's a kind of decentralized management

817
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,990
methodology that tends to work with

818
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:13,609
roles and circles anyway so the circles

819
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,759
that we would have you know in the holo

820
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:18,380
kratom you of decentralized management

821
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,170
translate into roles in our our back

822
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:23,420
system so you know that's basically how

823
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:25,730
it's handled so and of course we create

824
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,400
Tiger teams for individual assignments

825
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:31,369
but there's also larger more perpetual

826
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,140
teams that are you know for example like

827
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:35,060
the pentester team and the

828
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,920
project management team and the IT and

829
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,619
infrastructure team so and this all

830
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,570
translates into our back and this also

831
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:43,369
is how we stop you know customers from

832
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:44,900
being able to wear run scans against

833
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:49,400
their competitors or something using our

834
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:51,710
infra so other things error logs so

835
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,530
what's really nice is we can actually

836
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:57,260
we've got a chatroom that tails the

837
00:35:54,530 --> 00:36:00,110
error logs we've also got a another

838
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,240
chatroom that tails debug logs on things

839
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:04,340
and what this means is that it allows

840
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,740
people on our infrared team to be able

841
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,990
to debug stuff without needing shell on

842
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,270
the server

843
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:14,810
yeh you know so this kind of thing is

844
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:17,990
also really quite handy of course with

845
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:20,150
all these check commands well it's a lot

846
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:24,200
to keep straight in your head so we also

847
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:25,610
built a sort of a help menu system so

848
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,080
that our pen testers if they want to

849
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:29,150
know what commands are available you

850
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,860
know a little bit like UNIX man pages to

851
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:33,500
sort of help them through you know

852
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,150
knowing what commands you do want them

853
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,670
and what the syntax is so we've also a

854
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:39,830
built a system for that you know and

855
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,660
then ultimately sort of I think the sky

856
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,790
is the limit with what you can do with

857
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,950
these chat pods you know there is

858
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:48,710
research at some point that I would be

859
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:50,569
sort of curious in doing and there are

860
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:53,960
questions like for example you know

861
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:56,900
could you use could you create AI chat

862
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:00,470
BOTS you know and could these AI chat

863
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:01,700
BOTS perhap help with things like you

864
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,220
know answering frequently asked

865
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,169
questions for people or you know helping

866
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,879
you know like if you're onboarding new

867
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,850
staff members you know that kind of

868
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,140
thing possibly so you know this is the

869
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,400
kind of thing I mean I don't want to

870
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,140
pump a whole lot of money into this

871
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,780
research you know because it's not

872
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:20,180
operational of course from a company

873
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,970
perspective but I think this is this

874
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:25,009
kind of stuff is very interesting like

875
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,990
projects like masters theses projects

876
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:30,950
for AI students and things like that so

877
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:34,609
so that's pretty cool yeah and other

878
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:37,790
things like can we use AI chat BOTS for

879
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:40,310
for example satisfaction surveys and of

880
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:42,320
course satisfaction surveys in general

881
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:44,060
are really incredibly annoying you know

882
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,170
I tend to get them you know via email

883
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:49,920
and I almost always ignore them

884
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:53,970
but the nice thing is using chat ups you

885
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,730
can sort of mix the routine and kind of

886
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:59,310
like method methodological miss you know

887
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:01,380
of having a bot with the actual human

888
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:03,390
touch of having humans there so for

889
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,430
example if you were to use a chat bot to

890
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:08,220
say hey customer you know aren't you

891
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:10,740
satisfied with you know with whatever

892
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,660
service you just got you know and then

893
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,910
basically one through five or something

894
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,319
like that if it turns out then that the

895
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,240
customer gave you a one because they're

896
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,010
really not that happy instead of you

897
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,959
know the chat bot or you know just

898
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,970
basically keeping that and they're only

899
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,800
interfacing with a machine you're gonna

900
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,799
have live humans in the channel so if

901
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,240
you see a response that surprises you

902
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,250
and that requires more clarification

903
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,229
than an actual human can sit there and

904
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,120
ask questions you know as opposed to

905
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,220
their interfacing with a automated

906
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:41,009
system you know you perhaps could also

907
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:43,799
use a similar system for things like

908
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:45,420
also you know satisfaction surveys for

909
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,220
the stuff that you work with like are

910
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,010
you happy you know I mean this kind of

911
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,779
stuff is also useful to be fair we

912
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:54,120
haven't implemented this yet I mean this

913
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:57,090
is future work but I mean this is what I

914
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:59,310
see as being some of the promise of AI

915
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:00,840
chat BOTS I'm sure there's more that you

916
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,549
can do with this you know the sky's the

917
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,160
limit but this is research and I think

918
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,540
the more of us adopt this workflow you

919
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,950
know the more innovate innovations we

920
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,420
make and hopefully we can then open

921
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:14,359
source all the innovations that we

922
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:18,510
create so it turns out actually that our

923
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:20,400
workflow is quite innovative actually my

924
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:25,140
company is also quite innovative we have

925
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,270
a bit of a strange business model we're

926
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,640
also a social enterprise which is worth

927
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:31,980
saying and I set up radically open

928
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,560
security also as a non-profit company

929
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,820
this requires more exploitation and to

930
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,640
be honest that's a whole different talk

931
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,960
that I'm not going to give today but we

932
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,109
have won a whole bunch of awards

933
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,470
actually for our company and for the way

934
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:49,650
that we work including this open and

935
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:51,270
transparent workflow so the Dutch

936
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:53,160
Chamber of Commerce called radically

937
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:57,000
open security the fiftieth most

938
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,940
innovative SME in the Netherlands you

939
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,530
know also we

940
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,000
yeah have been involved with other our

941
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:07,349
pen testers one of them won the pony

942
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,920
award at blackhat for his research also

943
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:14,640
we created a knitted kit project which

944
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,559
was basically a non profit completely

945
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,569
open-source tour and opened VPN router

946
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,799
for journalists and activists that we

947
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:21,839
built together with Free Press unlimited

948
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:24,140
so that won some awards from the AI sock

949
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:30,630
and from the Internet freedom festival

950
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:33,029
and also I won an award from CIO

951
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:36,990
magazine calling me the most innovative

952
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:40,109
IT leader and the Netherlands so anyway

953
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:43,348
it's not about me but it's I think more

954
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:45,660
rather about the ideas so you know I

955
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:48,299
believe that what we're doing right now

956
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:51,180
with with chat ups I mean this is really

957
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:54,180
kind of a new innovation with

958
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,669
penetration testing it's also I believe

959
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,680
an innovation that can also assist you

960
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,349
guys and help you all raise the bar to

961
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,359
do more open and transparent pen testing

962
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:06,539
which I think ultimately will help you

963
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,578
guys to also improve the relations with

964
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:11,190
your own customers and also allow you to

965
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:13,529
have better pen testing services I think

966
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:16,559
also this chat UPS is not only useful

967
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:18,589
for pen testing I know actually hosting

968
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:23,609
providers believe it or not who have

969
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:25,950
dump trials with our pen text system and

970
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:27,930
also had really good feedback from their

971
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:30,750
customers you know for using hosting

972
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:33,538
services with chat ups and believe it or

973
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:35,250
not we even got approached by one of the

974
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:37,319
Dutch ministries talking about if they

975
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,690
can use chat ups in a pilot for open

976
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:41,880
government so I think that there's

977
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,260
actually a whole lot of really cool and

978
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,109
different stuff that we can do with chat

979
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,920
ups you know and it's just up to us to

980
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:53,250
sort of explore the space and and try it

981
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:56,430
anyway I am out of time so I think I'm

982
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:58,349
gonna wrap it up here so I'm happy to

983
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,040
take any questions at this point thank

984
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:09,210
you very very much

985
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:09,210
[Applause]

986
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,839
[Music]

987
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:22,509
sounds like the chatbox can do a lot of

988
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,270
things and so it must have permissions

989
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:27,520
all over your system apart from your

990
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:28,630
access control list so you mentioned is

991
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,960
there anything else that you have to do

992
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:35,380
to make this safe yes good question so

993
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,599
indeed it is allowing the chat BOTS to

994
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,549
do a whole lot of stuff and indeed we

995
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,799
have been thinking quite critically

996
00:42:39,549 --> 00:42:44,288
about the actual backend architecture of

997
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:45,700
this system so I mentioned before that

998
00:42:44,289 --> 00:42:48,700
we're in the middle right now of this

999
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:51,819
big DevOps refactoring and a whole lot

1000
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,230
of that involves containerization so in

1001
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:56,140
the refactoring that we're doing right

1002
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:58,900
now we're busy actually trying to create

1003
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:02,770
an individualized container basically

1004
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:04,599
for each customer and ultimately an

1005
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:08,650
individualized container for each

1006
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:10,510
assignment so basically if all of this

1007
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:13,390
is then running in its own virtual

1008
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:14,920
machine basically if there is a breach

1009
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:17,589
of some kind then it would actually only

1010
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,170
give access then to the to the VM that

1011
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:22,990
you know this particular assignment is

1012
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:25,690
is running in so yes we've thought of

1013
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:28,919
this and this is a basically another way

1014
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:32,980
that we're trying to isolate things

1015
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:35,980
there are still of course ways that you

1016
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:38,859
would need to federate this stuff I mean

1017
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:40,930
especially authentication wise so I mean

1018
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:42,520
this is definitely a work in progress on

1019
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:44,980
our side but this is definitely why

1020
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,450
we're going the DevOps route you know

1021
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:50,049
with a lot of this stuff because really

1022
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:52,750
what we want is we want to create these

1023
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:55,299
containers and then when an assignment

1024
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:56,799
is over we want to destroy them again

1025
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:59,589
you know and this is sort of another

1026
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:00,940
OPSEC thing what I really want I'm not

1027
00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:02,619
going to say that it's happening as much

1028
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:05,920
as I want it but this is the direction I

1029
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:07,779
want to move in is that once we deliver

1030
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,029
an assignment for a customer what I

1031
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:11,619
won't want to do is we've we already

1032
00:44:10,029 --> 00:44:14,450
have a Ross bot command that can take

1033
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:16,220
the rocket chat transcript and then

1034
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,750
make a text file of that and then check

1035
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,270
that into the correspondent gitlab

1036
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:21,710
repository what I then want to do is we

1037
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,200
can basically get a tarball

1038
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:26,390
of that gitlab repository and then what

1039
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,460
I can do is I can give that to the

1040
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:31,359
customer and then I can say dear

1041
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:34,550
customer I don't want this on my server

1042
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,799
take this tar ball and if you keep it

1043
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,660
you're responsible for it you know I

1044
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,670
don't want it you know but but you take

1045
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,859
the star ball and if you ever want us to

1046
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:44,930
do a retest then you can basically give

1047
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:47,720
us that tar ball back later and then we

1048
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:49,669
can reconstitute the container basically

1049
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,078
using the tar ball and then at that

1050
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:53,690
point then we have what we need to be

1051
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:55,099
able to offer you retests and things

1052
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,560
like that in the future so that's

1053
00:44:55,099 --> 00:45:00,290
basically another sort of OPSEC thing

1054
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:02,779
that we're doing we also of course do

1055
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:04,609
regular regular pen testing on our own

1056
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,990
infrastructure and I can't tell you I'm

1057
00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:08,390
probably not even allowed to tell you

1058
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:10,790
how many zero days we've found in raqqa

1059
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:12,290
chat and the associated software what I

1060
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:14,540
can say though is actually they've been

1061
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:16,759
quite responsive and quick about fixing

1062
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,560
them once we've reported them and in

1063
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,060
fact they became so enthusiastic with

1064
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,680
our reporting them that raqqa chat

1065
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,750
eventually just hired us as their

1066
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,299
security vendor so we could just pen

1067
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,750
test for them directly so that's pretty

1068
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,770
cool

1069
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:34,040
also you know is the security of this

1070
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:35,420
perfect no of course not I mean but you

1071
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,880
know we're dealing with complex software

1072
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:40,640
here I mean also web-based software so

1073
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,290
you know we're like any other company in

1074
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,868
the universe we to of course are also

1075
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:46,730
making trade-offs

1076
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:48,530
OPSEC wise you know it's a constant

1077
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:50,720
process we're constantly trying to

1078
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:53,180
refactor and raise the bar but you know

1079
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,980
like any other system I mean I obviously

1080
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:58,990
can't pretend that it's perfect I there

1081
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:00,589
because well no software is so thank you

1082
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:06,740
any more questions

1083
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:10,339
oh those very interesting thank you I

1084
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:13,669
have two questions actually so first is

1085
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:16,310
I can see the value of having people

1086
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:19,069
from the company that's being contested

1087
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:21,400
and from having a lot of those people to

1088
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:24,950
answer your question and stuff like this

1089
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,200
but you know like the answering and

1090
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,980
checking things for you obviously takes

1091
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,980
time

1092
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:35,000
not saying this is a waste of time but

1093
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:37,850
how do you deal with that do do is there

1094
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,920
in contract some kind of an appointment

1095
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:42,680
of people who are supposed to help you

1096
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,980
or you are just hoping that people will

1097
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:48,080
be helpful yeah good good question so

1098
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,280
the question is do all customers

1099
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,720
actually want to take advantage of the

1100
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,030
peek over our shoulder given that it

1101
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,368
might be time-consuming so the answer is

1102
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:57,050
no not all customers want it and they're

1103
00:46:55,369 --> 00:46:59,000
not required to do it either so

1104
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:00,859
basically it is a free additional

1105
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,140
service that we provide in the course of

1106
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:04,730
our normal pen testing if they want to

1107
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,529
take advantage of it we're super

1108
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:09,290
appreciative and we definitely incurred

1109
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,880
hit if they say we don't care we're not

1110
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:12,859
interested we just want to report in a

1111
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,960
black box you can completely you know

1112
00:47:12,859 --> 00:47:16,940
take this off our hands we don't want to

1113
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,470
see it we can do that for them too I

1114
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,540
mean it's not our preferred way of

1115
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:24,529
working but some customers are like that

1116
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:28,850
so yeah we can't accommodate that if

1117
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:30,800
need be so okay so another question or

1118
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:33,520
why don't the biggest problem in my

1119
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:38,690
opinion wave wave with chat ups is

1120
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:41,330
signal to noise ratio so I think that

1121
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:44,810
what you're doing being open is very

1122
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:48,380
helpful but not necessarily at the time

1123
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:51,200
it's happening didn't you have problems

1124
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:53,270
I mean what I mean is it's nice to go

1125
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,939
back in the history and see what was

1126
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:59,000
being done during the pen test but I

1127
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:01,580
don't need to know that right now I mean

1128
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,020
maybe sometimes I do but usually I don't

1129
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:05,450
even know that pen tester at this

1130
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:08,509
particular moment is doing something so

1131
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:12,169
don't you have problems with with having

1132
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:16,700
too much notifications and stuff yeah

1133
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:18,800
good question so uh I mean most slack

1134
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:21,799
like systems do you have a problem with

1135
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,050
what I would call chat dust I mean you

1136
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,580
basically you know if it's a very chatty

1137
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,320
room and there's people in there that

1138
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:29,420
are quite chatty than indeed you know

1139
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:33,530
the room can fill up with some useless

1140
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:35,900
stuff to be quite honest in most of our

1141
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:37,460
actual penetration test channels it

1142
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,400
tends to not be that to not be that

1143
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,460
chatty just because we have other

1144
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,080
channels in our

1145
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,660
company that are chattier I mean like

1146
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,130
we've got for example Ross off topic you

1147
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,899
know that's like our water-cooler so if

1148
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:50,700
people want to post idiotic memes that's

1149
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,560
where they go you know I mean we've also

1150
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,210
got Ross ethics you know which is

1151
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,799
another channel for discussing ethical

1152
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:57,900
concerns around certain kinds of jobs

1153
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,060
and you know anyway there's a lot of

1154
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,530
different also Ross pentesters which is

1155
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,810
kind of like the area just for the pen

1156
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:05,099
testers to ask each other questions

1157
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:08,490
about assignments and things like that

1158
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:10,560
so typically you know we do have an

1159
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:12,839
explosion of chat rooms that for sure

1160
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,250
but the only people that are actually in

1161
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:16,500
that chat room are the people that need

1162
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,730
to be in the chat room so the majority

1163
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,410
of the people actually who are on our

1164
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:21,270
system don't even get access to that

1165
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:23,399
much which means that there isn't quite

1166
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:25,950
so much to read which means that they're

1167
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,680
not the ones typically who have the chat

1168
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:31,589
dust problems however we are really

1169
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,970
careful to make it clear to people that

1170
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:34,680
what you write in the chat is not

1171
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,029
documentation because it just Scrolls

1172
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,859
away and you're never gonna find it

1173
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:39,780
again so anything that you would might

1174
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:41,549
need to reference later or that actually

1175
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,410
you know needs to be documented that

1176
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:45,599
needs to be done and get lub you know

1177
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:46,980
because anything in raqqa chat that's

1178
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,650
just completely worthless it's gonna be

1179
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:52,530
gone like you know after a day or two in

1180
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:55,260
terms of the customers you know are they

1181
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:58,980
overwhelmed you know by all of this not

1182
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:01,050
typically I mean the thing is we can

1183
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,330
actually do like with chat with slack

1184
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:05,580
like systems notifications for

1185
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:10,140
individual people so for example I can

1186
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:12,089
do you know at sign a user name and if

1187
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:14,190
that person is not actively logged into

1188
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:16,170
the chat at that moment they'll actually

1189
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:17,609
receive an email saying that you know

1190
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:19,859
somebody on the system sent you a

1191
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:21,060
message please login to to see what it

1192
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:23,279
is

1193
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,930
this actually then notifies people of

1194
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,640
actually when they need to be logged in

1195
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:28,710
which means that they actually don't

1196
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,660
need to be logged in I mean the nice

1197
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:33,240
thing about a slack like environment is

1198
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:35,759
that it keeps a backlog of the chat so

1199
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:38,310
basically what you have is synchronous

1200
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,500
and asynchronous communication at the

1201
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:42,420
same time which basically means that

1202
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,640
people can do other things that they

1203
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:46,710
need to do they can like go to meetings

1204
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,690
or they can sleep or they can you know

1205
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,280
whatever just be distracted and busy

1206
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:52,800
with other things and because this

1207
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,030
backlog is maintained when they log in

1208
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,980
again that then enables them to catch

1209
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:59,140
on the backlog if they want to you know

1210
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:01,420
and then you know be able to continue

1211
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,950
basically where they left off this is

1212
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:04,750
also by the way really useful for

1213
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:06,009
coordinating people across multiple time

1214
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,110
zones because I mentioned also

1215
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:09,790
previously that we have people in

1216
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,980
Australia but we also have people in

1217
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:13,690
Europe and we've other places and of

1218
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,240
course there's the whole time zone thing

1219
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:18,370
you know and sometimes I do have you

1220
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,350
know one European pentester partnered

1221
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:22,569
with one Australian pentester and then

1222
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:24,400
the customer is well probably in Europe

1223
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:26,440
but you know but sometimes they're in

1224
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,050
the u.s. I mean you know sometimes we

1225
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,960
have that um in that particular case

1226
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:34,330
then also the asynchronous nature of the

1227
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,460
chat also really works in our favor with

1228
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:38,620
that one so nobody has to be logged in

1229
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:40,630
all the time and nobody misses anything

1230
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,279
you know hypothetically speaking if the

1231
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,780
chat backlog were that overwhelming

1232
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,960
people can just say I'm not gonna read

1233
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,120
it

1234
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,850
just let you know give me a total to

1235
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:50,920
long didn't read you know but that's

1236
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:52,560
basically how we handle things and for

1237
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,460
the most part I think it's pretty doable

1238
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,810
anyway thank you I think I'm out of time

1239
00:51:54,460 --> 00:52:00,989
so thank you again

1240
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:00,989
[Applause]
