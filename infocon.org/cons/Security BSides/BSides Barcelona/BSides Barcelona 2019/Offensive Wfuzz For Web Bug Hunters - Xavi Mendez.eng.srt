00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:20,290
and the main developer of the way you

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:23,800
fast and busy pal security engineer the

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:30,280
sky scanner and we have open positions

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:32,168
so if you like in the box security cloud

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:36,640
security please let me know after the

10
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:38,108
talk yeah please when you buy us guys

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,530
kind of light please click on the

12

we don't get money so yeah I'm going to

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:53,769
talk to about when you first so welcome

15
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:55,269
to offences doll you fast for we're

16
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:57,879
hunters

17
00:00:55,269 --> 00:01:00,399
I don't know how I end up with 50 slides

18
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:04,420
so I think I'm gonna miss skip some

19
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:09,520
examples and I'm gonna go fast no videos

20
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:12,159
and let's see how it goes so a bit of

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,929
history the value of ice has been around

22
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:21,729
for for ages and first versions were

23
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:25,390
developed like in 2006 by some

24
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:28,179
colleagues at s21 sick buying well back

25
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:32,369
in Sant Cugat and it was maintained for

26
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:35,920
several years and until 2011 so I took

27
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:38,530
over while I was doing pen testing in

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,359
London and since then

29
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,579
well I took some breaks in the middle

30
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:48,750
but since then I've been like committing

31
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:50,949
new features to the tool until now and

32
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,859
well what is the value files I don't

33
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:58,390
know if anyone else w5 raise your hand

34
00:01:53,859 --> 00:02:01,630
you know all you want to well ok so it's

35
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:05,140
basically I work faster so what it does

36
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:09,460
is replaces the fast keyword but by the

37
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:11,110
way know that you supply and what is

38
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,890
we're facing we're facing basically is

39
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:17,890
like fast and not bad

40
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:22,720
we'll try to know what is unknown value

41
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:30,549
by sending a lot of different values

42
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:33,760
basically okay so what is w first used

43
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:36,190
for so if you look in the internet it's

44
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,989
going to be compared well mainly for

45
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,660
content discovery and it's gonna be

46
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:44,670
compared with dear be the bastard go

47
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:48,430
Buster or do search also barbed intruder

48
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:51,579
what also as a side note there B was

49
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,980
also called by Rahman pin wala back in

50
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:58,750
less than one six and also I think in

51
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:01,119
2005 or something like that also is

52
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,350
quite all and dear pastor is I think

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,390
hasn't been like any new update since

54
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,430
2009 or something like that so it's

55
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:15,519
surprisingly people is still using all

56
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:18,300
these all tools for this okay so it's

57
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,880
the only faster content discovery tool

58
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,170
what is content discovery really so

59
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,200
content discovery is trying to find

60
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:31,299
unknown directories or files in a web

61
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:34,480
server so to do that you basically have

62
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,980
like a huge x-ray and you go through all

63
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,079
the dictionary and try to understand if

64
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,470
if there is a resource that is there in

65
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,510
the web server the success of this

66
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:48,040
technique is based on how good is your

67
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:51,510
victory basically so it is the belief as

68
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:57,130
a Content discovery tool well it is I'm

69
00:03:51,510 --> 00:04:01,630
gonna show an example here and we are

70
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:04,600
using the web app multi demo website of

71
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:08,079
web inspect I think is this one so

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,890
basically it's a fake bank with a bunch

73
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:16,090
of vulnerabilities and I don't know if

74
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:19,479
you see anything from back there and but

75
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:25,479
this how well your first looks like I

76
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:27,030
don't know what anyway so so here we are

77
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,840
looking for

78
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:38,049
directories we have the URL there and

79
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:42,159
how this works okay so you have the URL

80
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:44,199
there and the fast keyword so and then

81
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:47,860
you supply a dictionary in this case

82
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,300
quick fix from checklist and so it all

83
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,620
device is going to go through all of

84
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:55,419
each word of the dictionary and here you

85
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,419
have a table this is the output output

86
00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:00,639
of the device where you have all the

87
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,500
responses and some information like the

88
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,199
code the lines the world and its

89
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,240
characters of the of the content of the

90
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,719
response and this is the payload that we

91
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,639
use and when you are doing when you are

92
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:15,389
using this technique is quite important

93
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,129
to filter the results because otherwise

94
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,750
as I said before the dictionaries are

95
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:22,120
are huge and you are going to end up

96
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:25,270
with a massive output and it's not going

97
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,819
to fit in even in the screen and so

98
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,240
that's why here we are using what we are

99
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:32,860
filtering in the filtering the coast by

100
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,819
404 so we already show in the ones that

101
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,529
are not 404 well if you look here there

102
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:43,440
are some interesting dictionaries like

103
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:48,490
admin backup DB this seems like Tomcat

104
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,830
admin panel so you get the idea and well

105
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,339
after this it's a matter of going

106
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:57,729
through all these results and see what

107
00:05:54,339 --> 00:06:01,180
is there so in this case this is the

108
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:05,878
admin panel and well it is the user and

109
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:08,469
password of data of the bank and what

110
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:12,060
you can imagine what you can do from

111
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:15,400
here but I'm going to go to the next

112
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,830
examples so yeah it's a Content

113
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:23,080
discovery tool but it does many more

114
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:24,818
things than that and well there are

115
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,839
examples in the I'm not going to go

116
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,909
through all the things that you can do

117
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:31,650
but there are other examples in there

118
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:34,569
looks like cookies fuzzy in

119
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:38,219
headers and using other payloads and

120
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:38,219
codeine and so on

121
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:47,110
we're w5 seats really it's like in in

122
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:52,719
them between your fully automatic tool

123
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:56,080
and manual pen testing so you will you

124
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:58,479
would use W fast when you want to know

125
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,058
what data you are sending back and forth

126
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,248
or if you don't just Delta mighty tool

127
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:07,209
that you are losing or if you have an

128
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:09,909
API and you want to send some crafted

129
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:13,449
data or you want to understand what is

130
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:17,169
behind in there is a proxy see the N and

131
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:19,330
so on so here you see what these cells

132
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:21,729
from the documentation see that bands

133
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,800
documentation and key things here is

134
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,330
that it has a filter language we are

135
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,479
going to go for this in the examples and

136
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:32,349
you can utilize the previous results so

137
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:39,308
we can do that like by saving the

138
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:42,938
session well this is my point of view of

139
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:44,469
W fast it seems that some people's

140
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:47,860
agreed so thank you

141
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:49,689
oh nice egg he says that this is like a

142
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,019
swimming Swiss Army knife

143
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:56,159
web security either why these guys doing

144
00:07:53,019 --> 00:08:02,769
with you and when you fast but is happy

145
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:04,599
well some others not I don't know what

146
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:11,229
happens with this guy but it's not happy

147
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:13,899
with the audio fast so I'm gonna go for

148
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:17,378
another example and to see how you can

149
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:20,009
use Bart's session and for that we are

150
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:22,680
going to use the one you're fast payload

151
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:26,559
well you first payload is a command-line

152
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:29,619
tool that allows you to query a session

153
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:33,610
that you have previously store and make

154
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:35,380
queries basically and try to explore the

155
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,849
queries or the HTTP requests and

156
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,849
responses that you have in that session

157
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:46,990
so imagine here that you have what we

158
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:50,680
are going to use this also demo site

159
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:52,149
this one is from magnetics and imagine

160
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,459
that you are doing your web assessment

161
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:59,649
you have your birth session with all the

162
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:03,310
requests and responses here with a burp

163
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:05,589
to store or lives in a file so we can

164
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:09,279
use this file and and and query this

165
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:12,010
file before in the old versions of the

166
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,470
well part you could do this by going to

167
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:17,279
the menu unsafe state and so but now

168
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:21,660
this is gone because the new version has

169
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:24,790
this project management and so on so

170
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:27,819
let's see we can use this and we can use

171
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:36,490
all the requests and response it that

172
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:40,390
that's our store here so okay let's read

173
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,800
from the bar session and I'm gonna zoom

174
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:50,949
here because I don't think you see

175
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:54,670
anything whoa I break it okay

176
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:59,430
I'm gonna gonna zoom yeah so here we are

177
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:03,610
using the bar blog a payload we are

178
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:10,000
saying define to read which is the bar

179
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:12,850
blog that we were say a bar to store and

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,580
you don't see anything more okay this is

181
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:21,300
not working anyway so they could thing

182
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:25,510
about this is that there is like this

183
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:27,880
filtering so here we are telling you on

184
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:31,630
your face payload to show all the

185
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:35,770
requests that have get on post parameter

186
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:38,770
and all the unique requests that have

187
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:42,520
any also get parameter so here you can

188
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,779
see all the requests I have that keep

189
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,510
this in mind because we are going to use

190
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:48,100
it for another example but this is a

191
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,250
simple example that you can use with

192
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:55,000
don't use you with really fast payload

193
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,980
and well you can use these you can use

194
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,230
this for any other feel like I don't

195
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,700
know if you want to understand your

196
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:06,730
application or you want to parse any

197
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:07,960
content or so on okay so in next example

198
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,900
I'm gonna

199
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:16,300
show you how to exploit as a single

200
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:17,470
injection in all the school way so I

201
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:23,280
don't know if you've been doing pen

202
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:27,070
testing like 10 years ago but back then

203
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,650
like trying to find sequel injection was

204
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:33,430
quite easy you only had to put like a

205
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:37,300
quote in every parameter and application

206
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:41,410
gave you like nicely an error say well

207
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:44,699
these are my my sequel error so you knew

208
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:50,100
that there was a sequel injection here

209
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:53,410
but if you want to do this for every

210
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:58,390
page and every parameter you're going to

211
00:11:53,410 --> 00:12:00,219
end up having to do cool or going

212
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,980
through the website and put a quote in

213
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,810
every parameter so it's quite painful so

214
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,620
we are going to do that automatically

215
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:11,229
and we are using the value fast for that

216
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,480
of course so now we have the same query

217
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:16,080
as before so these are the previous

218
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,780
request request that we had before and

219
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:24,820
then we are saying value fast too with

220
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:27,520
any get parameter to append a quote at

221
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:31,090
the end we also using a plug-in that

222
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:34,660
parses their responses and looks for for

223
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:35,820
arrows so here you can see well I don't

224
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,260
know if you can see from behind but

225
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,300
there are all the same requests as

226
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,420
before but there is a quote here and

227
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:50,500
then you can see the sequel the my

228
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:52,870
sequel error so like in 15 seconds 16 we

229
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,360
have gone through all the parameters and

230
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,190
pages of the website and we know where

231
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,370
where is the security action I mean this

232
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,110
is a still example but it's the idea how

233
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:06,190
we can use told you first what what

234
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:09,760
automated stuff okay

235
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:14,910
this example I'm gonna skip it because I

236
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:17,500
don't seem I have enough time okay

237
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,990
so now we are gonna get a little bit

238
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,750
more real and we exploit that we are

239
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,740
gonna exploit my ability

240
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,850
in the white so don't do this at home

241
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:33,139
did you do it

242
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:35,699
don't use your home IP address so I

243
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:40,829
don't know how many of you use conflict

244
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:43,500
confluence at work and so I don't know

245
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:45,628
then maybe so of these 10 how many of

246
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,000
you know that there is there is a remote

247
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:54,959
code execution that was published like

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:57,990
the 20th of March okay half of them go

249
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,479
and run if you don't know it you know it

250
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,879
okay I'm not gonna go for all I know

251
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:08,759
when I read these advisory but you can

252
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:12,990
go to the URL so what is the banality

253
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:18,660
about and basically is a path travel

254
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:20,819
cell that allows you well that makes the

255
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:24,180
widget controller whatever that is

256
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:28,229
with your controller of confluence two

257
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,599
parts a template and they could thing

258
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,569
well here is the parameter of the

259
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,490
template so you can put anything here

260
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:39,240
the good thing is that you can put any

261
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:42,870
remote template and inside the template

262
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,240
you can execute Java code so you end up

263
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:48,709
like executing code in the in the web

264
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:52,199
server well in the confluence server

265
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:56,790
okay so we have this new shiny

266
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:59,459
vulnerability how do we get targets for

267
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,029
what confluent servers to to exploit the

268
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:03,209
mobility

269
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:06,779
I guess everyone knows show then if not

270
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:10,859
is like a web search engine that well

271
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:13,050
you can use to search computers

272
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,709
connected to the Internet here we are

273
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:22,170
using well this is the confluence header

274
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:25,500
says X - confluence and according to

275
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:28,050
chosen there are like 26,000 confluence

276
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,649
servers in the world at least with this

277
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:35,209
query okay so now we have this

278
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:39,990
vulnerability we have this amount of

279
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:43,890
targets and how do we exploit all these

280
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:48,480
service automatically so luckily there

281
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:51,689
is new I really call this payload this

282
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,880
week for for this demo so there is a

283
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:59,160
shell and payload in W fast that you can

284
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:04,140
use so okay let's look for confident

285
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:06,689
service with with this paper so what we

286
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:09,569
are doing here this is the payload and

287
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:14,580
we are telling : to give us all the IPS

288
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:20,960
or host names that we think that that

289
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:25,560
our confluence here there is the path of

290
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:27,960
this well they won't have a path of the

291
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,979
banality that we talked about in the two

292
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:35,280
slides about before we say in some

293
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,530
random post data and because we are like

294
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,300
testing like a bunch of servers we are

295
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:42,180
going we want to go fast so we are not

296
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:45,959
we are going to ignore all the errors

297
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:48,959
and we are having a delay of one second

298
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:51,710
the connection delay by default is like

299
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,720
90 seconds but because we are going like

300
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:58,040
brute force in all this supposedly all

301
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,740
these 26,000 servers we want to go fast

302
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,719
and also what we are following if there

303
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:08,240
is any rhetoric we are following the

304
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:13,579
regulate and we are saving the session

305
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:15,870
okay so well this is the

306
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:21,180
part of the output of the value fast

307
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:25,500
after running this command and well here

308
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:31,100
you see or maybe done I'm gonna tell you

309
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:34,530
so you see connection errors you see 404

310
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,980
405 so basically you see a bunch of

311
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:43,399
responses from different servers you see

312
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:46,700
a genetics Apache and I think that's it

313
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,190
well different verses of hibachi but

314
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,559
there is an interesting thing here

315
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,299
so this is the color of the regulate

316
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:56,660
column and this is the paper that we use

317
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:59,809
so these are the horse names at an IPS

318
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:04,870
that Sheldon gave us and if you look at

319
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:08,899
some of some of these redirects for

320
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:11,689
example this one so here we have this IP

321
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:15,770
we made the query whether I should HTTP

322
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:19,130
request to this IP and nicely the web

323
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:22,960
server is telling us what is reacting as

324
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:25,669
to HTTP conference dot blah blah blah so

325
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,179
nicely in the web server is telling us

326
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:33,559
that it's a confluent server and so keep

327
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:36,200
that in mind because well another thing

328
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,700
I'm not showing because that was only

329
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,169
part of the output but at some point

330
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:44,750
there was an exception and well this is

331
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:46,309
because I'm using a public well API key

332
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,520
that is around the Internet

333
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:52,790
I haven't paid for Shaolin and you

334
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,490
should pay I have my key but for this

335
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:59,299
example I didn't use it I didn't want to

336
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:01,250
lose all my credits but the problem with

337
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:03,740
these key is someone has done the same

338
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:07,610
and there are no it's crazy in that case

339
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:11,540
so but sure then gave us like hundred

340
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:14,178
results instead of the 26,000 the first

341
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:18,080
page which is a hundred results is for

342
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:25,549
free so okay we have hundred conference

343
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:30,580
servers 100 results and as I said we

344
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:34,190
have a bunch of responses and ok as

345
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,889
commented before the ones that we think

346
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:39,350
so I mean we have to exploit this this

347
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:43,370
web service and we want to exploit the

348
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:45,709
confluent servers so which ones do you

349
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:49,668
think are gonna become fluent service so

350
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:51,890
like easy guess I'm gonna go after the

351
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:56,390
wife that says conference in there in

352
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:59,030
the URL in the host name so out of the

353
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:03,200
hundred that we care and we got from

354
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:07,950
Aden out of the 26,000

355
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,750
we have like six or seven here so do you

356
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,610
think we are going to get any anyone

357
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:21,480
that is going to be vulnerable and maybe

358
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:25,258
yes no okay so let's play them and what

359
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,700
we are doing here is well this is the

360
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:29,309
template parameter well this is all the

361
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,940
post data that we are sending is the one

362
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:37,070
that was in the advisory and here we are

363
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:40,919
specifying the template and we are

364
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:46,168
asking for web dot XML which is a

365
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,769
configuration of the web server it's

366
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:48,690
always there

367
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:53,820
so if it's a confluence server it's

368
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:55,799
going to be there and we are going what

369
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,928
we are just in a proxy I don't I didn't

370
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:04,740
want to use my home address basically it

371
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:06,629
and we run these we are storing the

372
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:12,000
session I don't even see the the

373
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:14,549
screenshot from here so yeah we run this

374
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,059
and if you look at this column here this

375
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:20,158
is like the characters of the response

376
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:24,720
and you see that some of them are quite

377
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:26,700
huge like quite big like a hundred what

378
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,100
kind of Keys case or something like that

379
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,970
so I mean it looks promising

380
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:36,689
it looks like the web Docs XML is there

381
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:41,070
and you have to trust me here or maybe

382
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:44,159
not because we only did the request we

383
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:46,980
haven't filtered away which ones are

384
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:50,429
burnable so the filter which was that

385
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:53,070
vulnerable well the web dog XML is start

386
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:54,360
with attack that it says web app and

387
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,668
finish with another attack

388
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:00,449
that's a waiver so we are going through

389
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:05,370
all the responses and look for the ones

390
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:08,190
that have this content so out of there

391
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:11,250
seven we have I think when it is

392
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,669
repeated but we have like four burnable

393
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,669
service

394
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:23,240
what what not that which I'd really hard

395
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,090
I mean we didn't try to resolve the IPS

396
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,190
we then try to get from the certificate

397
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,720
they see the SSL certificate the

398
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,960
hostname or things like that so we did

399
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:37,820
this really quickly and and with a basic

400
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:40,070
Sheldon query but yeah we had like four

401
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,169
potential potential no they are

402
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:46,040
vulnerable and I'm gonna show you here I

403
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:49,760
mean if you don't trust me this is a

404
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:52,940
cool request which is using the same as

405
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:57,500
the one in W fast but instead of getting

406
00:22:52,940 --> 00:23:00,050
the web doc dot XML template we are

407
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:09,140
getting a EDC password so this is the

408
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:10,909
ATC password of this conference okay if

409
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,170
you look at this I mean this is like a

410
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,030
kind of a complex

411
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:20,710
well complex I mean to write this it's

412
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:23,240
kind of painful we have no more time

413
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,970
okay I'm gonna go fast so this is like

414
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,650
the HTTP request I mean to write this is

415
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:32,000
kind of painful

416
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:34,070
so the office has the concept of recipe

417
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,940
so you can done all the command-line

418
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:40,850
options to a file then you share the

419
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,500
file with whoever you want like I don't

420
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:47,860
know if you instead of writing re-pour

421
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:53,570
you send this recipe to your customer or

422
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:56,540
you put it in a exploiting github and

423
00:23:53,570 --> 00:24:00,559
then you use the recite recipe and you

424
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:02,360
choose the file and you you can also use

425
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,190
whatever you one I mean other options

426
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,439
the URL for example for any other server

427
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,940
and this is the same example but using

428
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,160
the recipe and this is the same

429
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,190
confidence server that is we are

430
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:16,720
filtering again it wasn't a recipe and

431
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:19,490
this is the venerable confluence server

432
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,400
well I'm gonna go fast here but there is

433
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:24,380
a library so you want to scrape w fast

434
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,820
you can use this this is like for likes

435
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,879
to do like

436
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:33,019
brute force in all the artists of of

437
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:38,408
this website some ideas if you want to

438
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:41,809
star in web will imbibe bounties this

439
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:44,570
will have with all the domains that are

440
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:47,869
part of a bounty this harvester to do

441
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:50,210
some machine this is photo number to do

442
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:53,029
Crowley in or look at whatever is there

443
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:56,720
and these are one of the well the top

444
00:24:53,029 --> 00:25:01,609
then the nicks of 2018 and of course use

445
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:05,619
the office and that's it and thank you

446
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:05,619
for listening and you have any question

447
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,099
[Applause]
