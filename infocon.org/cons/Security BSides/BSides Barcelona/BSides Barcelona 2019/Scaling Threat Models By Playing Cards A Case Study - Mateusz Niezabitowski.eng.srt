1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:12,200
let's start with a little game or maybe

2
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:14,090
more like a thought exercise let's say

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,750
that you've just been appointed as a

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:19,070
head of security of some product maybe

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,300
that's in the game for you maybe you

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:25,820
have in the past or maybe you are one

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,570
right now then I guess it will be easy

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:32,180
for you but anyway you are responsible

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,999
for security of the product so what

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,149
would you do because I don't think I

11
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:42,199
need to tell anyone here that securing

12
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:45,019
things is not super easy so what would

13
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:49,210
be your first steps what would be your

14
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:52,210
first activities and I leave you with

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:55,339
with this question for a little bit

16
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,030
because probably I need to introduce

17
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:58,789
myself

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:03,649
so I will be talking about Freud

19
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:10,820
modeling and how we did it in my company

20
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:15,200
and we kind of scale it up with cards

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:19,309
actually and I think you understand what

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:26,990
I mean later on my name is Matteo I'm

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:29,900
from Poland and I've been working 19 for

24
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:33,020
about 11 years started a software

25
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,880
developer and around 5 years ago I

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,630
started drifting into application

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,390
security and now I'm working as an

28
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,940
application security engineer at Okada

29
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,180
technology you might have heard of a

30
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:49,610
kind of technology because we do have an

31
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:54,770
office and engineering office here in

32
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:58,880
Barcelona I mostly deal with Java web

33
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:02,380
technologies because that's most of most

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:07,520
of our products are written like that

35
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:11,540
but sometimes a little bit of more

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,180
unusual things I guess and from my

37
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,049
experience you don't really know what

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,700
application security engineer

39
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,660
because it's it means something

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:26,070
different in every company so my job in

41
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:28,650
Aikido is to help our developers to

42
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:35,010
produce secure code and I'll come back

43
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:39,240
to this later on and actually I decided

44
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:43,230
to create this dog with motivation that

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:46,170
can be summed up with a I quote to

46
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,480
somehow famous quote that in theory

47
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:53,030
there's no difference between theory and

48
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,920
practice but it's practice there is and

49
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,620
the problem was that we started doing

50
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,440
threat models in Aikido and it turned

51
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,340
out that the reason a lot of like

52
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,520
practical approaches me I mean there

53
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,920
wasn't a lot of materials to go on to

54
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,700
start and we've been doing quite a lot

55
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:18,000
of trials and errors and I kind of

56
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,640
thought that it would be nice to have

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,980
more information on how to do this in

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,609
real life if you are working in real

59
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:31,709
company so yeah that's why I'm here

60
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:36,330
and like a little thing I also wanted to

61
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:39,570
mention so yeah embrace your new penis

62
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:42,510
I guess because I do not consider myself

63
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:45,299
to be some super expert on threat

64
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:49,109
modeling this is not how you should do

65
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:51,959
this this is how we did it and yeah I'm

66
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:54,470
very open to discussions probably not

67
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,850
right now because that will be hard but

68
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:00,989
afterwards I'll be very happy to discuss

69
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,790
if you think that our ideas are good or

70
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,310
not

71
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:09,200
yeah just I'll be super happy to learn

72
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:12,209
from your experience experiences as well

73
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,600
right so short agenda is first of all

74
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:18,120
I'll try to explain more or less why we

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,019
think threat modeling is important and

76
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,900
why if you do this then there will be

77
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:28,710
I'll describe our process and finally

78
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:31,349
some lessons we have learned so going

79
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:35,619
back to the question from the beginning

80
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:39,159
you are this head of security and the

81
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:41,789
problem in my opinion that's obviously

82
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:45,479
only one problem but the problem is that

83
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:48,219
there is so many fun stuff you can do so

84
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,649
maybe you are super fond about bug

85
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:53,800
bounties and you want to roll and start

86
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:56,439
the program but like in the middle of it

87
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,930
you think but kind of we kind of suck at

88
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,789
deaf Cyclops and maybe we need some

89
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,430
tools to be integrated into pipelines

90
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:05,080
but you haven't even finished and your

91
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:09,309
lies that actually we are not training

92
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,109
developers so they don't actually know

93
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:14,860
how to write security code and so on and

94
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:18,819
so on the problem is if you are working

95
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,889
like this then you are not very much

96
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:24,520
different than Kevin here running around

97
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:27,569
trying to fix everything at once and I

98
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:32,649
don't think that's super optimal way of

99
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:34,689
introducing security so I'm not saying

100
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:37,809
that any of those activities I mentioned

101
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:39,399
before our bat are great but I would

102
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:43,839
suggest that you probably should start

103
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:46,330
with doing a threat model and this is so

104
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,240
you know so you have some kind of a

105
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:54,938
methodical approach to introducing

106
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:57,550
security and I kind of have this like in

107
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:59,769
my head I'm trying to I have this

108
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:05,649
visualization don't be a running

109
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:09,490
headless chicken or from the last reef

110
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:12,249
because and this is like pretty

111
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,949
important information do not Google

112
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:19,059
image search for headless chickens I

113
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:23,709
wanted to have some kind of a nice

114
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:29,529
cartoon picture in here but the results

115
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:33,789
are very disturbing and scene so I used

116
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:36,639
Kevin back then and I recommend you to

117
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:39,550
do not this is kind of still kind of the

118
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:43,449
way I am thinking about this to apply

119
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:47,830
some kind of you know order into your

120
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:50,830
to your initiatives and if you do that

121
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,448
then you'll be able to answer three

122
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,779
questions which in my opinion are very

123
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:58,930
important first of them being why do you

124
00:06:55,779 --> 00:07:01,509
actually want to be secure and if you

125
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,069
think this is strange I'm an application

126
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:06,909
security engineer and I'm asking this

127
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:09,009
question I mean they are paying me to

128
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:11,979
make everything secure so why would they

129
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:13,300
ask this question well I think this is a

130
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:16,659
very important question

131
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,120
because I would say that you don't want

132
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:21,819
to be a zealot Security's a lot if you

133
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,770
want to kind of have like nice

134
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:27,400
relationship with everyone around you in

135
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,120
the company don't do this you shouldn't

136
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,888
be like that

137
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,589
security is important because it's

138
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,419
important because it's a security that's

139
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:38,469
unfortunately arguments a lot of people

140
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:42,219
are making in our community I am afraid

141
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:44,080
and I'd argue that that's not an ideal

142
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:46,629
way and why is that

143
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,479
that's because while security is

144
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:52,120
important and I do know that I don't

145
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:55,419
think it is the most important thing so

146
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,909
if you have a product then the point of

147
00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:04,359
this product is to work to have

148
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:06,669
functionalities so one of my like funny

149
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,069
stories from the university time was

150
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:12,969
when we had this Java programming

151
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:15,310
classes and a friend of mine started you

152
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:18,789
know typing class blah blah and public

153
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:21,219
static void main I then sat down like

154
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:24,990
thinking what to write down right right

155
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:27,939
next right and the teacher was coming

156
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,639
behind his back he looked at his screen

157
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:34,000
and he said well congratulations you

158
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,448
have zero bucks which is true but at the

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,769
same time that wasn't really an

160
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:43,809
interesting program it didn't do

161
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:46,269
anything so it's full abilities just

162
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,609
don't write anything right but that's

163
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:52,839
not the point you've probably heard the

164
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:56,940
joke about the only secure server is the

165
00:08:52,839 --> 00:09:01,230
one that this is very deep on the seabed

166
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,660
well this is generally funny but again

167
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:07,199
this is not true even from the security

168
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:09,120
point of view because if you go back to

169
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:11,089
the basic what are the properties of

170
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,459
secure systems there's confidentiality

171
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:17,819
obviously there's integrity yes but

172
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:22,469
there's also availability and guess

173
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:26,130
which one of those server on the seabed

174
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:30,870
is not having what what property is it

175
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:33,420
not having and product are for users

176
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,220
they need to function if you focus too

177
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,769
much on the security and forget about

178
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,100
users and by the way about developers

179
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:45,509
who need to deliver this product then

180
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:47,759
actually you might hurt security in the

181
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:50,399
end because we all heard about like

182
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,500
workarounds like of anything like the

183
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,690
famous post-it notes with passwords on

184
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,690
the on the screens

185
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:01,939
just because you are requiring to change

186
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:06,120
passwords every every 10 days or so

187
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:08,910
anyway let's say that you know why you

188
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,730
want to be secure but the next question

189
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,130
is what security actually means what is

190
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,860
secure system which is kind of

191
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:20,939
philosophical I know but I will show you

192
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:24,240
two secure systems in next slides these

193
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:27,029
are real life system they are secured

194
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,680
obviously because the locks and nobody

195
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:33,689
says security more than locks right so

196
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,569
this is the first one there's the door

197
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:39,209
gate there's a lock and this is a secure

198
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:44,339
system apparently because you can do

199
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:46,560
this which is funny so I kind of Google

200
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:49,680
another example of this so again you

201
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:56,310
have lock on the door and it works right

202
00:10:49,680 --> 00:11:00,899
so the point is there's not a simple

203
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:03,359
definition of security and if you forget

204
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,819
about this you can do stupid stuff which

205
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,149
will give you no security in the end but

206
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:11,140
will make you spend a lot of time

207
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:18,540
working

208
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:22,230
I guess I mean you need to think about

209
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:25,959
your context about data you're storing

210
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:29,860
about your business model for example a

211
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,750
lot of security people in my opinion

212
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,560
focus too much on confidentiality of

213
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,600
stuff and again I'd argue that for a lot

214
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,770
of companies are very with availability

215
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,840
is even more important I know that for

216
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,760
my company this is the most important

217
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,130
thing that we need to be available this

218
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,980
is ecommerce if you're not available if

219
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:53,080
people are not able to purchase think on

220
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:57,730
your website then you are losing a lot

221
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:00,940
of money all right

222
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,740
and by the way yeah so the examples with

223
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,100
the locks were kind of obvious right

224
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:10,350
very funny ins and so on but it's much

225
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:13,240
easier to missed similar things with

226
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,940
software because with locks everyone

227
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,060
kind of gets it even if you are not a

228
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:22,530
trained security expert with software is

229
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:26,680
it's much harder to spot some problems

230
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:29,680
well finally you do know why you want to

231
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:32,469
be secure you do know what things will

232
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,099
make you secure with all your product

233
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:39,730
secure well that's easy now right just

234
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:43,900
do the thing but have you talked to your

235
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:47,980
product owners recently because their

236
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:50,050
backlogs are pretty full I I think can

237
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,990
you have you talked to your developers

238
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:56,260
from your company because I'm yet to

239
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,210
find the team in no kado that will say

240
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,250
that yeah actually we have nothing to do

241
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:04,020
for next six months let's work on this

242
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:09,340
security thing and the point is that

243
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:11,500
there is a lot of work on development

244
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:15,760
teams and you can't do everything at

245
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,310
once and you can spend like six years or

246
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,300
even months working just on security

247
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,770
because again the security is not the

248
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,390
most important thing you

249
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:31,630
to be delivering a business value at the

250
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:33,220
same time and because because of all of

251
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,880
that you need to prioritize your work

252
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:40,060
you need to work on each on problems on

253
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,150
or actually solutions that will give you

254
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:49,569
the most bang for your box right with

255
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:52,209
low effort a lot of security at yeah

256
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:58,270
this all sounds pretty reasonable I

257
00:13:52,210 --> 00:14:00,160
guess but unfortunately again even

258
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:04,180
though we knew that threat modeling is

259
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,480
important we had some problems with

260
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:11,079
running these initiatives initiative but

261
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:17,050
and I think the important context for

262
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:20,470
this is in the kado up Abzug engineers

263
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:23,620
and any other security engineers are not

264
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,190
responsible for security of a product in

265
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,400
okada

266
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:31,090
the whole responsibility of everything

267
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,709
product related is on teams so it's

268
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:37,090
going to be teams that will be working

269
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:39,850
on fret modeling in the end so yeah that

270
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:44,290
that was kind of a point we were

271
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:48,760
starting with and because of that our

272
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:52,900
approach had to be at least somehow fun

273
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:55,900
engaging I mean if people are bored then

274
00:14:52,900 --> 00:15:01,890
they will try to find every excuse they

275
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:07,230
can to not do this again right so yeah

276
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:09,970
also simple because they can't like the

277
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:13,120
development teams can't spend next month

278
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:16,150
or just like researching threat model

279
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,720
options and learning maybe some tools

280
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:22,329
used for threat modeling and so on we

281
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:27,490
kind of wanted to have a simples rules

282
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:32,020
as possible use white boards and Google

283
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:33,550
sheets not anything more complicated for

284
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,300
this and yeah that's it

285
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:40,359
and finally

286
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:43,449
at least our developers want to have

287
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,400
some sense of accomplishment so if I

288
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:49,480
make them sit for a prolonged amount of

289
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:52,840
time and in the end they feel that you

290
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,060
wasted this time again they won't they

291
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:59,760
won't don't want they will not want to

292
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:05,589
repeat the process again and that's why

293
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:08,650
we've chosen to go with so called by us

294
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:11,080
cornucopia approach actually there are

295
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:13,600
two card games out there one is

296
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,720
elevation of privilege by Microsoft the

297
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,640
other one is called copier by hours I'm

298
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,920
using current copier in this

299
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,439
presentation but we actually in Okada

300
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,380
used both of them they are very similar

301
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,570
and it doesn't really matter which one

302
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:34,150
which one you choose they are both very

303
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:36,880
good so probably you you can try both of

304
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:41,340
them and these are like cards

305
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:44,050
you can play a game with those cards and

306
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:47,440
actually we are starting with even more

307
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:50,290
fun which is drawing this is our step 0

308
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:55,980
it's not like the most important part

309
00:16:50,290 --> 00:17:00,189
but we do want to draw a system diagram

310
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:03,510
it's again not required but it helps you

311
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:08,290
to reason about the security of a system

312
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:13,150
in the future so then you get this card

313
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:15,849
cards you kind of played them and in

314
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:19,270
effect you are collecting threats you

315
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:21,879
are obtaining a list of threats which

316
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:24,520
are applicable to the system but that's

317
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,310
only half of the job because then you

318
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,980
need to assess those threats and that

319
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:33,250
means first of all quantify the risk

320
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:36,940
associated to the frets so what's the

321
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:39,280
impact was the likelihood how serious is

322
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,440
this problem this is very important from

323
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,930
the prioritization point of view because

324
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,910
you need to have this in order to

325
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:51,080
prioritize also assess if you are

326
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:54,530
vulnerable because Fred

327
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,679
can be also matteri already materialized

328
00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:03,710
as vulnerabilities in your system but at

329
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:06,440
the same time maybe it didn't happen yet

330
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:09,620
the so the thread haven't yet

331
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:13,910
materialized but you want to be prepared

332
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:16,300
in case it does in the first case you

333
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:19,790
want to probably fix the vulnerability

334
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,169
in the latter case you will want to

335
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,559
introduce some difference in depth

336
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:26,780
controls to make sure that even if some

337
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,990
foreigner to be vulnerability will occur

338
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,840
in a later on or maybe even if you are

339
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:36,890
attacked then you will be able to defend

340
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:39,350
yourself and then and this is pretty

341
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:43,790
important as well you need to agree on

342
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:46,389
actions so first of all can we accept

343
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:49,760
the risk associated with this threat

344
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,890
because not everything needs to be fixed

345
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,740
and definitely not everything needs to

346
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:57,380
be fixed right now so maybe we can

347
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,679
accept the risk like for a year or

348
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:04,550
something and companies do this all the

349
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:07,820
time this is kind of underlying the

350
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:11,360
foundation of businesses to take some

351
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,970
risks and it depends how much risk are

352
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,409
you willing to take but yeah sometimes

353
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:20,750
it's it's and it's a good thing to do

354
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:23,750
but even threat is pretty serious

355
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:27,470
then how much work are you willing to do

356
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:31,220
in order to fix this because maybe

357
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:33,020
there's some quick fix maybe you will

358
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,990
need to spend a lot of man days

359
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:40,400
preparing a fix and maybe you don't have

360
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:44,300
time for this right now well it depends

361
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:48,679
on the project but you need to actually

362
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:51,500
commit to do something and finally this

363
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,840
is not a part of fret modeling but I

364
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:57,220
thought it's pretty important include

365
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,620
this here as well so threat modeling

366
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,810
will be pointless unless you act in the

367
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,699
end so if you've committed to some

368
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:09,679
actions then do

369
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:12,110
this and introduce those fixes put put

370
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:19,550
some mitigations and things like this

371
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:24,740
right and I'll try to show you how fat

372
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:27,680
modeling mol/s could look like so

373
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:31,030
we'll be picking a card I mean cards are

374
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:35,740
already picked I was cheating I know

375
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:39,470
then I'll try to come up with some

376
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:42,740
threads applicable to tool the

377
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,440
application will be reasoning about we

378
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:48,220
are not going to do risk calculation

379
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,240
because it's kind of out of scope and

380
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:54,470
possibly we will propose some

381
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:58,730
mitigations and and repeat we have like

382
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:02,840
four cards I think but first as I told

383
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:07,460
you you need to draw so I drew a little

384
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:09,760
diagram this is some system let's see

385
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:13,790
some ecommerce system because you have

386
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,940
customer and he wants to put down some

387
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:20,690
orders in your e-commerce website there

388
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:24,770
is a retailer who wants to fulfill some

389
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:27,560
orders and there's also an admin of abdi

390
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:32,330
cloud because everything is in the cloud

391
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:36,379
because it's 2019 I guess so yeah

392
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:39,590
nothing really too complicated and see

393
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:42,020
yeah let's let's say we're doing threat

394
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,929
modeling applying the first card so this

395
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,210
is authentication 4 4 is the rank of the

396
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:50,420
card authentication is the suit and

397
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:55,280
Sebastian can easily identify user names

398
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:58,460
or can enumerate them so obviously I

399
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,330
will be simplifying things a lot and I

400
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,800
won't be going very much in depth but

401
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:07,370
you are talking with your development

402
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,530
team so it's disposable and you are kind

403
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:12,530
of presenting the idea of user

404
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:15,230
enumeration of vulnerability when you

405
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:18,080
know there's a different response when

406
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:22,010
you use wrong username or password

407
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,350
drink login and they are saying they'll

408
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:26,660
actually know about this and know the

409
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:30,610
error response is the same so we are

410
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:33,320
alright how about the password reset

411
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:38,300
this desire action actual conversation I

412
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:40,790
had and they are saying that yeah we

413
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,010
thought about this too so there's the

414
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,980
same message if you do a password we

415
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:49,640
said no matter if the account is present

416
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:52,480
or not but I'm digging deeper alright so

417
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:56,810
what about registration and it's like oh

418
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,300
and yeah it turns out that you can do a

419
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:04,010
user enumeration during registration as

420
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:07,430
well so we would put down a threat fred

421
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:12,350
is account can be enumerated using

422
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:15,890
registration functionality and then we

423
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:18,590
need to come up with solutions with

424
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:22,520
mitigations so one possible mitigation

425
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:24,530
would be obviously to return the same

426
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:28,510
same message no matter if the user

427
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:30,980
exists or not so yeah that could work

428
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:34,610
but the same time we're talking to

429
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:36,620
business and because of reasons business

430
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:40,729
doesn't like it so we need to accept

431
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:42,979
this risk in the end so all right this

432
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:45,890
is not bad I mean user enumeration is

433
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,170
not a huge issue so I think it's worth

434
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:51,020
accepting it this isn't an AI ideal

435
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,780
solution for me as a security guy but I

436
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:56,810
can live with this so let's play another

437
00:23:53,780 --> 00:24:00,440
card and it's session management Jack

438
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:03,460
and Jeff can resend an identical repeat

439
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:07,760
interaction for example HTTP request and

440
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:10,280
it's accepted not rejected so let's

441
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:15,100
focus on those HTTP requests so we are

442
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:18,139
talking about reply attacks right and I

443
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:21,830
informed developers that when we are

444
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:25,520
talking about HTTP then as long as

445
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:28,879
you're using HTTP reply attacks are not

446
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,100
possible but if we're using a plain HTTP

447
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,850
then there is a possibility of reply

448
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,928
attacks

449
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:39,168
and guess what the green lines on the

450
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:42,679
diagram are actually HTTPS and the red

451
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:45,049
ones are HTTP so obviously we already

452
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:48,350
see that there are some places in our

453
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:52,850
system that could be vulnerable to this

454
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:55,760
and well the solution is simple let's

455
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:57,949
just introduce HTTPS but and this is

456
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,440
pretty important what are the dotted

457
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:03,770
lines on the diagram these are so-called

458
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,289
trust bond boundaries so the transit

459
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:08,870
when you are inside trust boundary you

460
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:11,629
are trusting everything that's also

461
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:14,229
within the same class boundary right so

462
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:17,330
for example we have HTTP connection

463
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:20,360
between our fronts and micro services

464
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:23,689
and our back-end micro service well this

465
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:26,840
isn't ideal but since we are inside our

466
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:30,169
trust boundary we decide that we don't

467
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:34,039
want to introduce extra overhead of TLS

468
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:36,980
and we decide to accept this risk in

469
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,750
this case on the other hand there is the

470
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,360
HTTP connection between admin and

471
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:44,600
database and that's actually not ideal

472
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,729
because admin is connecting from outside

473
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,389
the cloud so probably from stuff from

474
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:53,030
someplace like on the Internet

475
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:57,020
so in this case the threat is much

476
00:25:53,030 --> 00:26:00,530
bigger and probably will want to

477
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:02,889
introduce HTTPS in this place so let's

478
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:08,178
say the dev team development team

479
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:11,059
commits to fix this in a week because

480
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:14,600
it's pretty serious at the same time we

481
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:16,940
have back-end microservices talking via

482
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,850
HTTP and crossing fast boundaries with

483
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,950
database so again this is not ideal this

484
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:25,129
these are these components are not

485
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:27,799
within the same trust boundaries but

486
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:30,169
because it's in the cloud then the

487
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:32,590
agreement is that we will fix that but

488
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:37,360
not right now we will introduce defects

489
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:40,639
in like two months or so so next one

490
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,620
cryptography eight-teen can access

491
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,040
stored business data for example

492
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:49,969
passwords because it is not securely and

493
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:53,090
or securely hushed yeah we read out loud

494
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,220
this card and developers are happy to

495
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:57,740
infer me that they are using

496
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:01,400
state-of-the-art joffrey function which

497
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:04,030
is obviously better than chateau so yeah

498
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,860
I now need to explain to them that

499
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:10,580
unfortunately even though Jeffrey is

500
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:13,310
like one version has this version number

501
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:17,659
bigger this is not how you should store

502
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:20,120
passwords and I explained the concept of

503
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,770
slow hashing why this is important I

504
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,639
explained the concept of offline

505
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:28,370
cracking and we agree that this needs to

506
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:32,930
be changed we don't want to accept this

507
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:35,750
risk but the problem is this is a lot of

508
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:39,530
work and we know because we've got we

509
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:42,770
didn't use a three we used back with

510
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:45,680
back rate which is like a nice function

511
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:49,639
but we kind of felt that we want to bump

512
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:54,100
up the hardness factor and we wanted to

513
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:57,050
migrate all the data into the like I

514
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:01,969
knew like the same algorithm but new

515
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:05,690
hardness factor and so on so we know

516
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:08,360
this is a lot of work and because of

517
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,640
that we can do this like overnight and

518
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,399
we need to be very careful because it's

519
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,000
password if we screw something up in the

520
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:19,340
process then we'll block everyone from

521
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,580
accessing our web page which is far

522
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:25,429
worse than having those sorry into that

523
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:28,070
database so we decide we'll fix this

524
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:32,230
within a year during a slow process with

525
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:35,120
multiple checks iterations and so on and

526
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:38,480
the last one I actually love this card

527
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,879
because it's almost always a sure thing

528
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,940
to have someone Suzanne frets to be

529
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,100
listed so Pierre can still convent the

530
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,650
applications controls because code

531
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,050
frameworks libraries and components

532
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:54,710
contain malicious code or

533
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:57,919
vulnerabilities so yeah if you ask your

534
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,840
developers what version of off struts

535
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,620
are you using over spring

536
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,659
they usually don't really know I mean

537
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:08,810
they might know the major evolution but

538
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:11,540
not the minor in most cases so usually

539
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:16,070
this is a problem but what are the

540
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:18,800
solutions so they could like daily check

541
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:21,169
for new versions of everything in their

542
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,690
dependency free tree which is obviously

543
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:32,000
kind of stupid because it's a very very

544
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:34,190
tedious work or they could like at like

545
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,280
some kind of automated tool to the to

546
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,590
the pipeline which stands for vulnerable

547
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:43,970
vulnerable components and there are such

548
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:47,120
tools and yeah well we are using some in

549
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:53,780
Okada because they're very interesting

550
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:57,080
but not yet in all projects so the idea

551
00:29:53,780 --> 00:30:00,590
is that after fret model link there is a

552
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,659
single task created that one of the

553
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,820
developers will check like the most

554
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:09,560
important components but within a month

555
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:16,820
or so we want to introduce this

556
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:19,280
automated tool as well but again this is

557
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,770
the last card I'm not not going very

558
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,960
much in depth in most cases there is

559
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,500
more than one thread applicable to a

560
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,480
card

561
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:30,070
so for example in this case you could

562
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,870
also talk about third-party JavaScript

563
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:34,129
used in your webpage right because it's

564
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:37,760
a malicious code in third-party

565
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:39,110
component and obviously the fix will be

566
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,780
very much different because you'll

567
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:46,990
probably want to use some something like

568
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:51,470
sub resource integrity or perhaps

569
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:54,890
content security policy both of this can

570
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:56,860
help you with this the point is the this

571
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,750
is another threat even though I

572
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:03,889
applicable to the same card and you also

573
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:08,600
need to take care of this so the games

574
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:12,920
goes on and on and this is kind of how

575
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,820
we do this and what did we learn in the

576
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,540
process of the

577
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:20,659
this this is probably kind of

578
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:26,060
interesting so the first thing is that

579
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:30,070
we really do like threat models and I'm

580
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:33,350
not gonna say there are perfect and

581
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:36,260
definitely the execution is not perfect

582
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:38,750
but it gives you a lot of a lot of

583
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,879
benefits and like the most obvious

584
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:43,370
benefits proven benefit is the reason

585
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,410
why you are doing threat models but we

586
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:50,959
have found out that there there are

587
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:54,560
another like bonus wins made possible by

588
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,640
threat models so first of all

589
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:00,620
documentation and system diagram if you

590
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,310
have no documentation it's already a

591
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:06,080
good start and consciously I would argue

592
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:11,210
that every good documentation should

593
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:14,750
have read model included iMovie as like

594
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:17,570
the world are not Yeti for this to have

595
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:21,430
this required yet but I think that

596
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:28,250
eventually that should be a case and

597
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:30,620
education so mmm you might you might be

598
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:33,800
running some programs on how to train

599
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:36,919
people so they know what the

600
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:39,950
vulnerabilities look like how to write

601
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:42,530
secure code and so on but you know the

602
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,780
training is like one two three days then

603
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:48,410
they forget everything or not everything

604
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:51,470
but at least some parts and this gives

605
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:57,230
you an opportunity to kind of reiterate

606
00:32:51,470 --> 00:33:00,590
also on some problem so I regularly am

607
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:04,580
forced to explain some vulnerability

608
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:09,350
some problems on those cards and after

609
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:12,470
this obviously after threat modeling the

610
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:15,889
side effect is that the dev teams is

611
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:18,440
also a little bit smarter because they

612
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:21,740
kind of learn a new vulnerability or a

613
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:25,370
new kind of attack things like this and

614
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:27,350
it really helps if you are using example

615
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,030
from all threat models in your

616
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,549
new faith models because you can say

617
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:35,240
that yeah you actually do want to fix

618
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:37,520
that because like team a and B also had

619
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,630
this problem and it was nasty so you

620
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:44,059
probably should fix that or if this is a

621
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,340
plant feature you probably should not do

622
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:49,789
this this way and so on and so on it's

623
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:52,639
much better to give examples from inside

624
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:55,190
your company if the guys know that their

625
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,230
friends made this mistake it's much

626
00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:01,270
easier for them to kind of accept that

627
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:05,360
this is this really a problem and

628
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:07,280
visibility so I as a knapsack struggle

629
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,299
all the time to get the visibility in

630
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:14,840
the company my role I wouldn't be

631
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,330
possible if I if people wouldn't knew

632
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,450
that I exist so I kind of need to go all

633
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:24,049
the time and remind people that I exist

634
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:27,049
I am absolutely engineer here hi and I'm

635
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:29,990
here to help if they don't know that I

636
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:32,899
am there they will not come to me with

637
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:36,770
the problems they may have so fret

638
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:39,888
models are a nice moment where you kind

639
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:43,850
of present yourself yeah also present

640
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:46,940
yourself of specialists so during the

641
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:50,089
process they kind of see that I know

642
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:52,840
what I'm doing and possibly they will

643
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:55,070
trust me a little bit more but also

644
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,830
because of the way how we do threat

645
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:59,840
models because of the approach with

646
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:02,830
which is not like you need to fix

647
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:06,410
everything now but because of like a

648
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:10,160
more realistic approach they also are

649
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:14,330
kind of inclined to share the dirty

650
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:18,740
secrets for example and to work with me

651
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:21,049
not against me right and by the way I

652
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,779
said about showing dirty secret

653
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:28,850
the visibility's ability works also in

654
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:30,980
another direction so if it wasn't for

655
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:34,790
fit models I wouldn't know about half

656
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:36,350
the problems we had in company because

657
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:39,259
you know there's this service

658
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:41,000
everyone except two guys forgot about it

659
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,950
it's been running forever

660
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,250
it's not listed anywhere if it wasn't

661
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:48,649
from Fred model and like the quick Oh

662
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,510
actually I remember that we have this

663
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:53,030
service nobody really cares about

664
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:57,380
anymore but it's still running like

665
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:59,680
these are very desire mmm how

666
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:03,260
conversations sometimes look like and

667
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:08,680
because of that I can do like oh wow so

668
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:11,420
that could be a problem can I can and

669
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,359
gathering like knowing all the assets in

670
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:16,369
the company is obviously very important

671
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,770
it's not a wafer modeling is not a way

672
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:21,260
to gather all the assets but it will

673
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:24,920
help you to get some visibility of over

674
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:26,720
what you have in a company back hunting

675
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,450
it's not the problem like the common

676
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,980
misconception is that during that model

677
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:34,640
you are kind of trying to identify

678
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:37,640
vulnerabilities you don't you are

679
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:43,160
looking for a threat for threats but in

680
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:45,950
the process you might imeem regularly I

681
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,868
get these red lights in my head turning

682
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:49,970
on because yeah that doesn't really look

683
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:52,970
great what you are describing to me and

684
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:54,709
then after that modeling I'll ask for an

685
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,990
access to the application I'll do a

686
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:59,329
little bit of a hog pen testing I guess

687
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:01,359
or of wannabe hunting and usually I'm

688
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:05,150
able to find something interesting

689
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:08,690
which I can show a show to the team that

690
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:11,839
yeah I was right the this isn't the best

691
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:15,290
way to approach this again not the point

692
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:20,328
but also happen mmm more than once

693
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:24,500
and current copia and elevation of

694
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:28,000
privilege give give you also a little

695
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:30,530
bit agility which is pretty important

696
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,329
which will be pretty important in a

697
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:35,060
minute

698
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:37,099
so you have those cards but we actually

699
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:40,730
stopped playing cards like we are not

700
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:44,619
playing like having a game we are just

701
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:47,420
using cards because they are very good

702
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:49,880
like the friends described there are

703
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:52,400
very interesting and are a great

704
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,860
starting point but at the same time it

705
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,390
turns out that like teaching people how

706
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,280
this game wars what are the rules and so

707
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:01,160
on was they were just wasting time so

708
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,890
the feedback I continuously got was that

709
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,740
it's not worth the effort and who are

710
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:09,740
still using the cards but not playing a

711
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,049
game also because these are cards then

712
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:15,649
the cards are very agile right there is

713
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:18,980
a lot of cards in agile and you can for

714
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:21,880
example choose to play a card every week

715
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:25,130
or every sprint or every stand up maybe

716
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,620
and over time you'll play through a

717
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:30,260
whole deck right so this is nice because

718
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:35,600
that will be when you will finish read

719
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:39,560
model yeah but as I said no everything

720
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:42,650
is perfect so there are three biggest

721
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:45,590
problem I see with Fred modeling in

722
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:47,600
general and especially I mean not

723
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:51,290
especially but in particular with

724
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:54,049
cornucopia and elevation of privilege so

725
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:57,770
first of them is time Fred modelling

726
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:59,750
takes a lot of time and actually that's

727
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:02,300
kind of the outcome of very cool thing

728
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:04,670
so every time I start Fred modeling

729
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:09,020
there is a lot of discussions being

730
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:10,610
started so there's this card and there

731
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:13,370
is this thread described so are we

732
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:15,530
vulnerable no I don't think we are but

733
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:17,390
you forgot about this service yeah but

734
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:20,660
we have some mitigations in place so

735
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:23,600
maybe this one and it goes on and on and

736
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:27,170
on and that's kind of the point so you

737
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:31,730
can't really like it because you would

738
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:34,100
be missing all the important bits but at

739
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:39,430
the same time playing even one card

740
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:42,350
takes a significant amount of time so

741
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:45,740
yeah I still think this time is valuable

742
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:48,650
so you kind of need to live with this as

743
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:51,979
I said this a giant approach could be

744
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:54,110
something that will help so we are never

745
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:56,480
playing like all the cards on the one

746
00:39:54,110 --> 00:40:00,410
sitting because it would take hours and

747
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:04,550
I'm talking like not two hours but more

748
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:05,390
like 20 hours probably and obviously you

749
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:08,530
can't host

750
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:10,270
sessions which are that long

751
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:13,720
because and this is another problem

752
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:16,920
these sessions are pretty tiring like

753
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:20,879
you wouldn't believe that I I think but

754
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:27,730
trying to come up with new threads all

755
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:31,300
all like constantly is is tiring like

756
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:35,350
really you are feeling tired exhausted

757
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:38,380
actually after an hour or two so first

758
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:43,089
of all again don't overdo this we

759
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:46,660
usually host sessions which are like

760
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:49,420
maximum two hours long and we are trying

761
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:53,350
to cut them even shorter we prefer to

762
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:55,720
have more shorter questions than one

763
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:58,750
long one for example to have one day

764
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:03,879
dedicated to fret modeling I am NOT

765
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:07,540
saying this wouldn't work at all but but

766
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:11,380
yeah it's probably better than to like

767
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:14,350
kind of split this also like you know if

768
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:18,340
you are kind of a company that can get

769
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:20,259
cookies into the room or pizza or house

770
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:24,130
with modeling in the evening and even

771
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:26,890
maybe some beer then that also helps to

772
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:29,140
kind of refresh the group but don't

773
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:32,410
overdo this actually we overdid it a

774
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:36,520
little bit and like not with the beer

775
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:41,649
fortunately but the point is you need to

776
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:44,890
be focused and like pizza can distract

777
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:47,700
people a lot for example and this is

778
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:51,160
this is stupid this is really simple but

779
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:53,950
I had this problem so many times that I

780
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,569
need to kind of stretch this out make

781
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:59,379
sure there is a fresh air in the room

782
00:41:55,570 --> 00:42:02,530
because if there's not then after 30

783
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:05,350
minutes people will get sleepy they want

784
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:08,050
what he will be engaging in the

785
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:14,290
conversation as much and yeah that's not

786
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:16,930
so great and finally as I started this

787
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:19,120
presentation I told you that the kind of

788
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:21,910
a problem was that even for me and I was

789
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,940
supposed to be in like space

790
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:27,430
security specialist even for me

791
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:29,319
getting all the information on how to do

792
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:32,259
fret modeling how this could work in a

793
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:35,430
company and so on was pretty it was

794
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:39,250
pretty complicated I'm not gonna lie and

795
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:42,308
if we are talking about developers who

796
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:46,030
are not skilled security experts then

797
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:48,789
it's even worse for them and I

798
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:52,630
unfortunately don't consider those

799
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:56,319
projects to be so simple that you can

800
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:58,569
just tell your developers well do a

801
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,930
threat modeling use cornucopia you'll be

802
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:02,380
good

803
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:06,930
unfortunately that's not how it works we

804
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:10,720
are hosting a lot of demo sessions and

805
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:12,700
during these demo sessions we are going

806
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,598
through the whole process but I am

807
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:19,899
present in the group and I'm helping

808
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:23,079
them I'm explaining how how this works

809
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,410
and so on and so on and we are doing a

810
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:28,480
lot of those like eventually the Pala

811
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:31,750
there needs to be some point where I'm

812
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,299
almost non-existent on during those

813
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:40,529
sessions I only get results or something

814
00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:44,140
but right now we are not there yet and

815
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:48,339
yeah this summer aigis do I recommend

816
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:51,250
doing Fred model Inc yes definitely I

817
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:54,759
still think this is one of the most

818
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:56,829
important things you can do to make sure

819
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,339
your product is secure it doesn't give

820
00:43:56,829 --> 00:44:02,740
you like immediate security but it can

821
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:07,450
help you to plan everything further on

822
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:10,808
and the processes we have are not

823
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:13,118
perfect yet even Cornucopia even have

824
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:16,990
the elevation of privilege aren't

825
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:21,160
perfect but it's still better to do

826
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:25,149
something then do nothing right so don't

827
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:29,740
try to be perfect and just start doing

828
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:33,420
fred models and you will see if we if it

829
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:37,790
works for you or not and

830
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:42,420
I guess that's it I'm happy to answer

831
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:45,050
simple questions if there are hard ones

832
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:48,690
I like that we don't have time for this

833
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:51,260
so don't worry yeah but I I think like

834
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:55,770
the point of this talk was to kind of

835
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:57,360
make you think about this and I really

836
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:59,910
don't expect that many questions but

837
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:03,000
maybe more conversations later on and

838
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:05,460
I'm very open to this I I don't even

839
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,480
have time for conversations right now so

840
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:11,180
yeah questions are welcome anyway I

841
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:19,340
[Music]

842
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:29,069
[Applause]

843
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:29,070
[Music]

844
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,600
[Music]

845
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:38,040
imagine before you started this as you

846
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,560
said the team's agendas were already

847
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:48,420
filled how did you persuade people to

848
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:52,130
take part in these sessions I don't

849
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:55,410
think there's a simple answer for that I

850
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:59,730
think it needs to be clear in an

851
00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:02,430
organization that you care about

852
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:05,700
security so there needs to be like

853
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:08,970
something like do you remember like Bill

854
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:12,779
Gates trustworthy computing memo that

855
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:15,720
went around Microsoft so that was a good

856
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:18,090
example of management very much

857
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,399
supporting the idea that we want to

858
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:22,920
produce secured software and I think

859
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,650
that needs to be clear and then I

860
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:32,160
actually think that I was pretty helpful

861
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:34,910
like I was pretty effective with this

862
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,540
because I had good relationship with

863
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:43,109
with with my friends my colleagues and I

864
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:46,500
I didn't talk about this but we strongly

865
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:47,130
believe in security engineers being a

866
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,490
neighbors

867
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:52,980
not blockers in our company so everyone

868
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:55,470
knew that I'm not trying to kind of did

869
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,570
this way this won't be like another time

870
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:59,879
there is this security guy who is saying

871
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:04,080
no no no no no but it will be a

872
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,850
conversation and we will and we'll have

873
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:10,110
outcomes that will be interesting for

874
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:14,390
everyone this is probably uh the you can

875
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:16,890
do to make sure that it works and

876
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:19,020
finally I was from the beginning very

877
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:21,690
open about the process about the

878
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:25,290
reasoning so like the whole process

879
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:27,620
starts with like simple 15-20 minutes

880
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:30,750
presentation I'm giving to the team

881
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:32,310
explaining why we consider first

882
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:35,010
modeling to be very important and

883
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:38,040
describing how we will do this later on

884
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:40,290
and again I don't think there's a simple

885
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:44,420
answer to this question but I think

886
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:44,420
those three things are helping a lot

887
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:50,100
hello just one question for curiosity so

888
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:52,230
applications and systems continuously

889
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:54,930
evolve right so how do you interact on

890
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:56,520
what Callens the set modeling exercises

891
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:58,819
on your applications and systems when

892
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:02,759
they change like I'm monthly quarterly

893
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:05,340
annual basis yeah that's actually the

894
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,620
the biggest struggle we have and to be

895
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:10,800
honest I don't really have answers yet I

896
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:15,690
mean we do recognize this as being an

897
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,870
issue I don't think I mean Fred modeling

898
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:19,500
takes a lot of time so you can't

899
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,819
especially if you are doing like

900
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,530
continue to deliver or something like

901
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,180
this

902
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:26,460
the you can't really fret model each

903
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:28,649
iteration but you need to repeat the

904
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,920
process every now and then I don't think

905
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:34,740
it needs to be repeated very often but

906
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:38,340
it needs to be repeated like every half

907
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:42,299
a year or year and and this is this is

908
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:43,980
how we are trying to solve this but well

909
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:49,470
till now to be honest it doesn't work

910
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:52,470
that well we are playing with the idea

911
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:55,799
which I kind of hinted during the

912
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:58,319
presentation to do this in a continuous

913
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:01,049
way meaning instead of doing thread

914
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:05,459
model ink now and then next one in

915
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:10,249
in a year let's like play one card every

916
00:49:05,459 --> 00:49:14,939
week or so and you are doing this like

917
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:19,890
constantly they're like I don't remember

918
00:49:14,939 --> 00:49:23,009
it's like time 13 I think

919
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:24,929
cards in cornucopia so it will take

920
00:49:23,009 --> 00:49:27,239
probably a half or so

921
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:29,069
to go through all of them but then you

922
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:32,309
start from the beginning and we are

923
00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:33,299
constantly evaluating this isn't this

924
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:37,079
isn't perfect

925
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:44,029
I know but again this is a huge effort

926
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:47,489
and we can justify taking a week work

927
00:49:44,029 --> 00:50:05,729
like taking a whole week of work for a

928
00:49:47,489 --> 00:50:08,369
dev team every month or so so yeah first

929
00:50:05,729 --> 00:50:11,669
of all thank you for making it

930
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:14,819
understandable also for people who don't

931
00:50:11,669 --> 00:50:19,229
belong to the security in this industry

932
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:23,519
like me for example I come from software

933
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:26,609
testing which means unconcerned it also

934
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:32,118
about security of course but I'm not an

935
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:35,209
expert and I like the approach because

936
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:40,709
as far as I understand if even though

937
00:50:35,209 --> 00:50:44,038
you can end up accepting specific risk

938
00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:49,019
you perform risk analysis and risk

939
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:52,949
management before in any case and and I

940
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:58,288
like it because I've been noticing a

941
00:50:52,949 --> 00:51:04,139
worrying trend recently some project

942
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:06,479
management managers tend to not to do

943
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:10,949
risk analysis at all risk management

944
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:14,189
they just assume risk I don't know if

945
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:16,650
it's because they are not skillet

946
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:21,780
things or just because they know it

947
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:25,170
takes some effort as you said so my

948
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:29,550
question is have you been noticing this

949
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:37,260
issue as well and if so how did you deal

950
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:39,630
with it well to be honest like the risk

951
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:42,360
analysis from the business point of view

952
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:45,180
is a much wider topic than that just IT

953
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:50,700
security and I obviously focus on the on

954
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:53,759
IT security and even though not like

955
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:57,620
whole IT security because I mostly take

956
00:51:53,760 --> 00:52:00,210
care of application security so I

957
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:03,600
haven't noticed this trend in our

958
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:07,620
company at least but I'm not sure if I

959
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,069
would because I kind of see a small

960
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,650
picture

961
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:13,710
I think threat models are great to

962
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:17,130
deliver to your management later on so

963
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:21,930
they can use this in the risk analysis

964
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:26,550
but our my point of focus is kind of now

965
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:28,319
narrow you know like it doesn't so we

966
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:33,270
are not considering things like you know

967
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:35,430
like robberies or or fires or floats or

968
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:38,759
some things like this which actually

969
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:41,009
should be taken into account in in a

970
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:48,240
company probably I mean like at least a

971
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:51,780
company like academ so I think and by

972
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:56,100
the way I hope I mean I'm trying to fix

973
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:58,110
this but I tend to say developers and

974
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:01,259
this is actually pretty bad because I

975
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:03,780
always mean development teams with a

976
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:06,330
Latino kado consists of many people so

977
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:09,860
for example we are engaging POS inferred

978
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:13,590
models we are definitely engaging

979
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:17,100
software engineering tests and actually

980
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:23,100
we had even user experience guys joining

981
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:26,370
us and everyone who feels that his time

982
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:28,250
won't be wasted during this is welcome

983
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,690
to come and I'm usually trying

984
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:32,210
make ourselves open as possible this is

985
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:36,790
this shouldn't be focused on developers

986
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:40,130
only so I probably said developers along

987
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:43,340
along my talk more than once and what I

988
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:45,890
meant was like development team like

989
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:56,900
actually just the team responsible for a

990
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:59,629
product so one of the things that you

991
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:02,420
mentioned was the threat modeling gives

992
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:05,720
you visibility of the issues which kinda

993
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:07,880
makes me think like you do on for

994
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,459
example services that already running in

995
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,290
there so I mean my question would be

996
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,390
have you also don't threat modeling

997
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:16,640
alone services that just on inception

998
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:19,009
like on the mindset of someone before

999
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,350
doing so and if you see in kind of

1000
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:22,970
measurements in stemple instead of if I

1001
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:24,560
don't threat modeling when I was

1002
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:26,870
designing my service

1003
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,400
I also reduced potential risk instead of

1004
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:30,319
just you know doing when something is

1005
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,360
already there I kind of have in like the

1006
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,610
visibility of the fest are already there

1007
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:38,420
yeah that's a very good point and

1008
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:40,370
actually during my presentation to the

1009
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:42,500
teams I'm explaining that threat

1010
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:44,420
modeling is actually even better if you

1011
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,610
are doing this from the beginning

1012
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:49,730
because it's possible that you will

1013
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:52,730
avoid a lot of design flaws because you

1014
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:55,040
know vulnerabilities you fix them you

1015
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:57,880
forget about them that's cool but design

1016
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:02,150
flaws oh that's that that's nasty and

1017
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:04,040
the problem is that unfortunately no

1018
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:06,650
hado most of the stuff we already have

1019
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,980
there is not that much I mean there is a

1020
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:11,270
lot of new projects but unfortunately

1021
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:14,120
threat models we were running were

1022
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:16,759
mostly about projects which are already

1023
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:19,310
created but if you have a chance to do a

1024
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:23,510
threat model before development starts

1025
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:27,350
in the like early design phase that's

1026
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:31,070
even better because you can from the

1027
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:34,819
beginning indeed mitigate a lot of risks

1028
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:36,290
and just make sure this won't happen so

1029
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:39,530
yeah mmm

1030
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:42,200
I guess the simple answer is this is a

1031
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:44,660
great idea we would

1032
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:47,149
like to have this this way but

1033
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:51,140
unfortunately in real life we didn't had

1034
00:55:47,150 --> 00:56:04,190
a lot of chances to to fret model new

1035
00:55:51,140 --> 00:56:08,908
systems okay thank you

1036
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:08,909
