1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:11,870
I will go with your decision all right

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,120
wow that's a full room we did not expect

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:17,410
this I have to tell you these guys did

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,599
not expect so many people to show up and

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:23,720
on a personal note before I start off

6
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:25,550
blabbering about failing and b-sides and

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,610
communities I just want to say again

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,279
thank you to the organizers here I've

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:35,120
known them for about a year now

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,550
give or take and I can tell you that it

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,400
they worked extremely hard to set this

12
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:44,269
up for you and there's been a lot of

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,550
emotions around it and efforts and it's

14
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,760
every time there that I see a new b-side

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:52,640
starting off in in a city I'm amazed

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,280
it's each and every time each one is a

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,470
story of its own each one is you know

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,079
different personas and technologies and

19
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,600
communities and each time that it

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,229
happens it's like a home oh my god it's

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:10,040
it's mind-blowing yeah so I wanted to

22
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:11,120
talk today about failing and for the

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,470
rest of the day you're probably gonna

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,210
hear a lot of really cool stories about

25
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:21,950
your community about you know people

26
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:24,889
like us that are taking you know a big

27
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,450
step standing on this stage not like me

28
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,070
I'm just you know talking about stuff

29
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,470
but they're actually doing research and

30
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,970
putting out interesting stuff and

31
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,260
telling you about it and educating you

32
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:38,179
but they didn't get here just by chance

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,690
they got here by by doing a lot of this

34
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:46,100
and and I think that that's one of the

35
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:49,670
most untold stories that don't really

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,339
get the the front stage in in our

37
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,740
community or even in general and as

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,400
someone who's made a career out of

39
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,169
failing or failing successfully I think

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,000
it's it's really important to to kind of

41
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,159
understand that and that's really a key

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,310
to having something like this happen

43
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,959
yeah my you know initial conversations

44
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,019
with with these guys was like yeah we

45
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,329
can do it besides we probably can bring

46
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:15,930
like 20 50 people sound like that I was

47
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:19,920
like no no no

48
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:23,050
step it up it's gonna be a lot more um

49
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,790
let's start my name is Ian I'm the the

50
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,050
chief security officer for force impress

51
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:31,959
and in my my night job or any other jobs

52
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,209
I'm also the president of the board of

53
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:38,349
besides Vegas we've been doing this for

54
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:40,780
10 years now 11 yeah well we we suck at

55
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:46,950
counting so we're celebrating 10 this

56
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:51,459
year it's an utter fail and and there's

57
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:53,069
my animation suck ok yeah I'm gonna kill

58
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:56,709
you for this

59
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:59,649
we have you know we're growing up on a

60
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,959
lot of success stories a kind of the

61
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:07,650
heroes of our time the the Jeff Bezos

62
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:10,510
and the Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and

63
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,640
they're like the Titans of tech there

64
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,310
are the people who we look up to that

65
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,349
have made it that have started literally

66
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,580
with nothing not like the American

67
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:21,839
version of nothing

68
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:24,130
the really nothing and set up

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,160
multi-billion dollar companies products

70
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:31,299
that we're all using everywhere and

71
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:34,180
things that are changing our lives but I

72
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:38,829
want to talk about how they got there

73
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:41,920
and what made them what they are and

74
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:43,840
it's not really those successes the

75
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,059
successes we celebrate all the time it's

76
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,239
the failures and as you can see in my

77
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,930
own personal failure of not managing my

78
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:57,870
slides anyone remember the Microsoft

79
00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:01,150
Zune ok ok I was expecting like a

80
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,730
younger crowd that's awesome Microsoft

81
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,230
Zune was Microsoft's attempt to compete

82
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,149
with the iPod I think it even came out

83
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,858
before the iPod and from not if I'm not

84
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:13,660
mistaken um it's a really interesting

85
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:17,739
concept or kind of understanding that

86
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:19,329
this thing preceded the iPod coming out

87
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:20,888
first doesn't necessarily mean that this

88
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,860
is going to be the successful on and

89
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:28,559
Microsoft miserably failed with the Zune

90
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:31,109
and is still not in the music industry

91
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:34,379
you know I mean they've lost that battle

92
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:38,219
a long time ago now it's mostly

93
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:39,839
controlled by Apple and Spotify and and

94
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:41,369
the smaller players Microsoft is not

95
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,219
even playing not on the hardware side

96
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:48,479
not on the the media side and that's a

97
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:50,909
again multi-billion dollar industry they

98
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,669
had it they had it they had ie they even

99
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:55,739
had like a few versions of it and it was

100
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:58,558
competing at your head with with an iPod

101
00:04:55,739 --> 00:05:01,649
the market was there complete failure

102
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:04,669
when we look at Apple Apple even even

103
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:08,879
didn't start as a successful company

104
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:12,089
only after a couple of really horrible

105
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,329
iterations of really shitty computers if

106
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:18,809
you remember this is this is the Apple -

107
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:21,839
no Lisa yeah that's the Lisa this is the

108
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:24,089
Apple one horrible computers they didn't

109
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:27,149
work there ultra expensive they're

110
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:30,149
really really bad iterations of a

111
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:31,859
computer but they needed that failure

112
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:34,589
they needed to put something out there

113
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:36,989
they went on a limb and they said there

114
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:40,379
is nothing right now that fits what we

115
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:43,109
want let's build it they got some

116
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:45,839
feedback really harsh feedback trust me

117
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,899
it feedback that you know when I'm

118
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,929
thinking back about the the first days

119
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:53,669
of Apple that kind of feedback would

120
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:55,438
have crushed most people and they would

121
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:57,329
just just like you know what it you

122
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,329
don't want it they'll need it I'm gonna

123
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:03,059
go off make you know big big IBM

124
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:04,949
machines but they didn't they kept on

125
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:07,889
going and I said alright so so the one

126
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:10,139
wasn't good the Lisa is kind of it's

127
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:12,749
almost there and then they came up with

128
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:18,749
the Apple 2 which blew the market to

129
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:22,199
pieces anyone remember this phenomenal

130
00:06:18,749 --> 00:06:26,489
machine the Apple Newton all right this

131
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:29,339
was before iPhones this was before iPads

132
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:31,919
this was before the Palm Pilots this

133
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:34,589
thing had like handwriting recognition

134
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,459
it was the most sophisticated thing it

135
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:42,060
preceded its time by by a decade at

136
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:45,660
least if I'm not mistaken they went

137
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:48,930
they designed a device with a

138
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,780
touchscreen with graphics the size of

139
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,970
you know a mobile device like a proper

140
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,929
mobile device the market didn't even

141
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,350
know what to do with it

142
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:00,870
it was just like what do you want we're

143
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:04,320
still in the Apple and an IBM like the

144
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:07,130
PC era and these guys were innovating

145
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:11,940
way beyond their time and guess what

146
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:14,190
disastrous failure disastrous and now

147
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,840
every one of us almost every one of us

148
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,320
holds one of those in their pocket

149
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,929
whether it's an iPhone or an Android

150
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:25,320
they've literally paved that way through

151
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:29,580
those horrible business failures a

152
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:32,190
project like this kills companies kills

153
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,859
them and this is not about some

154
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,480
financial resilience whiz-bang like

155
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,640
running the numbers this can kill a

156
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,520
company because the amount of resources

157
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,409
and the man-hours and the money that you

158
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,960
put into a project like that to get it

159
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:49,140
into a commercial version is insane

160
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,719
you're betting a company on something

161
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:56,550
like that and it fails what do you do

162
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:59,640
now Windows ME if we're moving on to

163
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,160
gates so we're done picking on on Steve

164
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,560
Jobs Windows ME again

165
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,950
colossal failure not that the windows 98

166
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,650
before that was a phenomenal operating

167
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,780
system but you know what you keep

168
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,919
iterating I talked about the Zune so

169
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,549
we're gonna leave it alone

170
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:20,850
phases I used to work for for Amazon you

171
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:24,540
have no idea no idea how many failed

172
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:27,930
projects major projects Amazon allows

173
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:31,620
itself to go through in order to be that

174
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:35,070
that hyper successful company Amazon

175
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,169
fire phone one of the few projects that

176
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,720
actually make it out

177
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,819
you know going through those additional

178
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,360
gates that a lot of other project just

179
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:48,540
stopped and kind of recognized the

180
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,620
failure there so by itself it is a

181
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,959
double failure because it failed to stop

182
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,800
getting to production when it where it

183
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,959
should have

184
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,410
and then in wedding to production we

185
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:04,050
need to full failure mode an Amazon

186
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,670
managed to I don't know within six month

187
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:10,319
if I'm not mistaken they've killed it

188
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:13,319
they were able to make the decision that

189
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,690
again manufacturing line software

190
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,100
hardware everything that went into this

191
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:21,540
stopped and they just killed a project

192
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,560
colossal failure guess what

193
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,529
still one of the most successful

194
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,060
companies in the world I think I've seen

195
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,870
a graph of the number of people that

196
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:34,649
work for Amazon they're topping 600,000

197
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:42,120
people like 600,000 employees when I got

198
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:44,670
there in 2015 they were at around two

199
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,820
hundred two hundred and thirty thousand

200
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:50,939
employees in a year they hired more than

201
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,370
a hundred thousand employees insane

202
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,089
numbers you can't get there without

203
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:59,070
failing on the way there is no way to do

204
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:01,500
that if you keep succeeding it's just

205
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,779
not gonna work and we'll we'll skip

206
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,120
pets.com because that's a that's really

207
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:10,380
old-school let's talk about some of our

208
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:13,160
own heroes like hacker heroes anyone

209
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:17,160
recognizes the guy on the left

210
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,730
Mitnick of course anyone recognizes the

211
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,730
guy on the right

212
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:29,029
not bunny

213
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:35,959
no let's borderline racist but no I'm

214
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:40,920
just kidding here nothing Thank You

215
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:41,399
Shima Maura rings a bell starts to ring

216
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,250
a bell

217
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:50,750
alright out of these two who's the more

218
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:50,750
successful hacker not famous successful

219
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,190
you don't want to play

220
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,930
it's it's the first the first hour I'll

221
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,139
give it to you so most people go like oh

222
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:04,939
my god kevin Mitnick

223
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:08,760
why is he famous because he went to jail

224
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:12,810
because he got caught how does that

225
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:17,040
qualify someone for being our you know

226
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:18,300
hacker community hero because he got

227
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,439
caught by the FBI

228
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,329
come on the real story about kevin

229
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,190
Mitnick and and I invite you to Google

230
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:29,459
this and read about it it's a

231
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:32,040
fascinating story is that kevin got

232
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:34,768
caught because he picked on a guy he

233
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,889
kept on he picked on Shimura kevin was

234
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:39,899
having problems a because he was he kept

235
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:42,089
getting traced back to his landline or

236
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,250
to the land lines that he was hacking

237
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:46,649
and using and he decided to go into

238
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,149
mobile and he didn't know about

239
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,790
mobile not that he knew a lot about

240
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:53,699
technology but he was looking for

241
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,500
someone who knew mobile phones and had

242
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:57,060
the right software and the right axis

243
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,029
and he found this guy

244
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,888
Fiona Morra was working as a consultant

245
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:02,459
Kevin stole the software stole software

246
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,790
from him

247
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:08,250
sorry using it and humor just went into

248
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:11,939
humor who wasn't really a hacker hacker

249
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:13,709
but guess what he was deep inside it's

250
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,949
not about what you do it's it's about a

251
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:20,310
mindset and humara went on full-on

252
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:22,589
hacker mode and decided to go after

253
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,930
Kevin because now we're talking pride

254
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:27,959
and you stole my software now you're

255
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:32,430
using it illegally to do bad stuff went

256
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:36,149
after him all of the forces in the US

257
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:39,599
all the FBI the police MIT Berkeley all

258
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:44,579
the other universities PAC bells AT&T s

259
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:49,500
of the world couldn't catch Mitnick one

260
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:52,769
person did Shima Morra he hacked back

261
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,660
that's the first hack back that that we

262
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:56,220
know of well there's probably before

263
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,610
that but that's the the most famous one

264
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:03,000
and Shima Mora learned along the way

265
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:05,519
failed a lot of times and managed to get

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,380
back in catch Kevin he was the one that

267
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,230
enabled the FBI the end of the day he

268
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,980
was consulting

269
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:14,710
eventually and tracked back Kevin into

270
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,260
his his location in North Carolina if

271
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:20,500
I'm not mistaken that's how he got him

272
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:24,310
and these are some more relevant

273
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,710
pictures of those two so this is G or

274
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:29,170
Morra back at his office in in

275
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,640
California if I'm not mistaken when he

276
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,410
was working on the the mitten the case

277
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:37,720
back at the time and this is Kevin in a

278
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:40,360
more natural environment we talked about

279
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,320
Steve Jobs before the real success of

280
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,560
Apple and the real ability to iterate on

281
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,280
failure and iterate on products wasn't

282
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:54,310
really jobs it was was Steve Wozniak

283
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,839
he's a real hacker inside of Apple he's

284
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,209
the real kind of innovator and techie

285
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,180
these are the heroes that we should be

286
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:04,150
talking about when we're talking about

287
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,839
successfully failing failures of

288
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,310
grandeur let's talk about how to

289
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,790
successfully fail how to do this

290
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:15,579
correctly first first and foremost you

291
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,620
have to step on a limp it's about

292
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,180
innovation it's about stepping out of

293
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,780
the comfort zone and saying I am willing

294
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,660
to take a risk and part of it is getting

295
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:30,459
into that mindset of planning to fail if

296
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:32,589
you start something off with no plans of

297
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,870
failure with no ability to understand

298
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,400
this is I am taking myself out of a

299
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,730
conference though this is not just

300
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,699
following instructions one by one you

301
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:49,360
will never succeed I love this image

302
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:51,930
everyone's like think about it when

303
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,890
you're starting a project and you're not

304
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:59,680
creating failure plans

305
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:03,040
this is the real fail when you're doing

306
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,250
anything that is not that has not been

307
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,170
done before at least not by you make

308
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,750
sure to take into account kind of a

309
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,390
couple of exit points all right what

310
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,060
happens if this this little cart doesn't

311
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:19,480
have brakes so I jump out of it at this

312
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,760
point good idea before it picks up too

313
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,269
much speed what happens if you

314
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,800
I can't break a certain algorithm or or

315
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:31,209
get to a point where my memory

316
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,490
optimization or you know my Rob my Rob

317
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:35,859
tricks don't work in this environment

318
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:38,230
have a failure plan if you don't have

319
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,199
those you're just not gonna going to

320
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:44,709
succeed deconstructing and building on

321
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,660
lessons learned think about all the

322
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:51,790
times that you try to attack something

323
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:53,649
try to learn something new and you kept

324
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,790
running into things that eventually

325
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:59,320
turned out someone else already found

326
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:02,860
using other people's lessons and and

327
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,959
failures is the key look guys I'm lazy

328
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:08,649
alright there's no other way to sit -

329
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:12,189
you need to go about it but I'm using my

330
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:14,079
laziness and convincing myself that

331
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,810
there's got to be someone else that did

332
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,479
something like that before I'm only

333
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:21,699
leaving whatever mental and physical

334
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,699
energy that I have left do actual work

335
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:28,319
for things that I'm pretty certain

336
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:31,329
no-one did before for everything else

337
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:33,099
someone's got to have a solution so

338
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:36,160
focus your energy on doing things that

339
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:39,399
actually matter deconstruct other

340
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:44,199
people's work use their failures to plan

341
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:46,930
your your own failure is the real

342
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:50,290
experience if you talk to someone who's

343
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:52,899
only had successes there's nothing to

344
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:56,380
learn like what what did you learn by

345
00:16:52,899 --> 00:17:00,459
doing something and it just worked is it

346
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:03,670
gonna work every time are you sure is it

347
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:04,869
repeatable can it work better if you do

348
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,159
something and you're just like alright

349
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:11,198
that's it done you've done nothing

350
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,679
it's like gee thanks nothing to learn

351
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:17,169
from here let's get a little personal

352
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,059
and because people are like oh you're

353
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,600
staying on stage you're keynoting no no

354
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:25,000
let's talk about some real visceral

355
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,549
failures and this is a cool story when I

356
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,970
when I was starting off during red

357
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:32,650
teaming and and this this fits perfectly

358
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,590
because yesterday we're sitting around

359
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:38,740
picking locks and everyone's like

360
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,110
this big monstrous masterlock yellow the

361
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,760
the yellow that no one managed to pick

362
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,070
and ever like all right doesn't work

363
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,740
doesn't work it doesn't work and I'm

364
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:49,928
talking picking up the lock talking to

365
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,340
some of my colleagues and I'm starting

366
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:54,659
to pick at it because it's it's like

367
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,100
it's fun and and I popped it I picked it

368
00:17:54,659 --> 00:18:00,190
and suddenly everyone just stops and

369
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,730
goes like you just picked that lock I

370
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:07,679
was like yeah of course I didn't get

371
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:12,130
good at picking just out of the blue I

372
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:14,440
actually really sucked at it and one of

373
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:17,049
my first red team engagements were I had

374
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,140
a physical element sawn into the

375
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:21,700
engagement I'm Anna - first of all

376
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,700
convinced myself to sell something that

377
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:28,299
really didn't exist my skill sets were

378
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:31,360
not set up to do any kind of physical

379
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:33,820
like lock-picking testing in a real

380
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,658
environment that is not this one lock

381
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:41,220
that I practiced on and I found myself

382
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:44,409
at an office building after I somehow

383
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:50,320
brilliantly managed to lock myself in a

384
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:53,260
conference room I spent a couple of

385
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,860
hours there you know as under the guise

386
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:59,230
of a guest I'm inside I'm hooking up to

387
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,059
like the the a/v systems and hopping I'm

388
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:03,159
pivoting inside a network everything's

389
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:05,129
going fine I'm getting data I'm doing

390
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,110
like hopping on voice over IP networks

391
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,909
everything's great at some point someone

392
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:12,639
comes in apparently the the room wasn't

393
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:15,490
booked anymore someone comes in opens

394
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,590
the door a little bit peeks inside I'm

395
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,299
kind of cowering in the corner they

396
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,250
don't see me they close the door lock it

397
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:25,330
walk away it's 4:30

398
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:27,220
it's like a semi-public company so by

399
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,379
5:00 everyone's gone and I'm like

400
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:33,399
starting to realize oh this is it

401
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:36,730
I'm locked inside I spent the next 45

402
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:40,178
minutes 45 minutes sweating bullets

403
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:44,820
trying to lock - to pick this like six

404
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:47,409
pin cylinder like super tight lock

405
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,939
sweating bullets I'm like I'm gonna stay

406
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:49,180
here until tomorrow and this is gonna be

407
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,030
a

408
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,460
heresy I'm gonna be a polo sweat is this

409
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,260
is horrible why am I doing this I

410
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,610
started doubting my whole career path

411
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:01,060
life choices

412
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:04,050
I was on the phone after four or five

413
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:06,850
minutes with my contact at the company

414
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:09,490
starting to play out like how am I gonna

415
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,879
explain that I need someone to get back

416
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:16,510
to the office get up all the way to the

417
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,010
like the 14th floor and unlock me from

418
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:22,420
the conference room I was supposed to

419
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:25,450
break into so I can go back home and

420
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:28,270
start writing the report as I'm on the

421
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:31,540
phone it was literally within like my

422
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:34,510
last shreds of dignity I managed to

423
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:38,320
unlock this this monstrous which is now

424
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:40,750
I realize a piece of hit lock make some

425
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,689
some fake-ass excuses on the phone and

426
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:46,120
and drag myself and and my shattered

427
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,820
dignity back home understanding that

428
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,409
this thing is either never gonna work

429
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,439
again and I'm not dealing with red

430
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:55,990
teaming ever again or I'm gonna have to

431
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,380
get a little better at this and get some

432
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:03,550
more practice fast word if four or five

433
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:05,140
years this is a from one of the red team

434
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,870
classes that Chris and I gave in

435
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:10,720
Columbia yeah this was the first red

436
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,270
team class we gave and these are

437
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,950
Colombian school girls that go to a

438
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:21,840
American continent you a American school

439
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:25,720
really fancy neighborhoods really like

440
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:28,060
rich families there were our translators

441
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,800
they weren't even like doing anything

442
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:35,490
there our translators for the class and

443
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:39,510
we were teaching them how to pick locks

444
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:42,190
10 minutes later our security detail

445
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,460
which we invited inside because they

446
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,840
were going like what are you guys doing

447
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,410
they didn't speak a word of English

448
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:53,409
we're like hand waving them inside our

449
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:55,600
security detail is working on locks the

450
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:57,610
school girls are teaching them how to

451
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,270
pick themselves out of their own

452
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,270
handcuffs

453
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:08,789
we wouldn't have gotten here if I didn't

454
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:12,940
end up locked up in that office building

455
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:15,520
five or six years earlier contemplating

456
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,500
life choices and considering like

457
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,809
changing jobs maybe because this is

458
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:23,620
horrible and and I suck at it and I

459
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:25,418
failed if you have any idea what is it

460
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,049
to pick locks and I highly encourage you

461
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:30,190
to do so

462
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:30,879
45 minutes working on the lock I can't

463
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,500
believe I did it

464
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,080
back at the time I was like I didn't

465
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,909
have my choice but it was a colossal

466
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,428
failure and that's one of the best

467
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:42,120
experiences that I've had that kept me

468
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:44,590
driving forward and kind of expand my

469
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,629
horizons into you know more and more and

470
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:50,860
more into the physical security side of

471
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:53,860
things look for the signal in the quiet

472
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:56,408
so we I mentioned our hacker heroes

473
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:59,918
before and our kind of industry leaders

474
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:02,679
and as you'll note there's a lot of

475
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,710
noise that these guys are making there's

476
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:08,380
a reason why almost every hand was

477
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,940
raised here when I asked who's the guy

478
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,179
on the left that's camping meth Nick

479
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:16,510
again media hero he's everywhere

480
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:18,580
everyone knows his name he goes on TV he

481
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:21,010
gets paid thousands of dollars to to

482
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,750
speak at conferences he's running some

483
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:27,039
shady businesses doing some shady stuff

484
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:28,649
done by other people but a lot a lot of

485
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,539
noise

486
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:33,850
Shiva Morra no one's heard about him I

487
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:36,340
had to like almost go one by one until

488
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:39,789
the guy at literally the back of the

489
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:42,370
room was like Maura no one heard about

490
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:46,658
it because there's no noise but there's

491
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:52,658
a lot of signal and it's really key to

492
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:56,039
try to pick up the the signal in the

493
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:58,659
quietness look for the guys who are not

494
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:01,570
putting themselves out there who don't

495
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:04,750
have thousands and tens of thousands of

496
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:07,658
followers on Twitter were not on every

497
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:10,240
freakin stage on every freaking security

498
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:12,340
conference look for the guys that are

499
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,850
putting themselves out there maybe have

500
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,779
like a

501
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:19,928
repo maybe make it to a small conference

502
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:22,740
look for these guys this is HD more on

503
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:25,889
the right and spoon em on the left

504
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,289
hey for those of you who don't know

505
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:34,149
there they wrote Metasploit anyone knows

506
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:37,330
Metasploit yes of course Metasploit was

507
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:44,258
a shitty program I know I've been there

508
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:46,418
at blackhat 28:12 no mm and what I wrote

509
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:49,450
it down here 2004 oh my god I'm getting

510
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:51,399
old um I couldn't find pictures from

511
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,080
blackhat for some reason so this is

512
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:54,549
their Def Con talks the same year and

513
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,480
when they released mouse Floyd for his

514
00:24:54,549 --> 00:25:01,029
first time he was written in Perl

515
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:04,120
now again I'm old enough to be able to

516
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:07,419
hold on and do something functional in

517
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,699
Perl I'm betting you if any of the young

518
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:11,799
kids here understand what we used to do

519
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,179
in Perl they would just go like that

520
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,759
that is horrible

521
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:19,419
that is the absolutely wrong way to do

522
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:21,549
anything related to computing so they

523
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:24,610
wrote this thing there this project in

524
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:26,200
Perl in 2004 horrible but if you're not

525
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,870
it kind of worked it worked like in a

526
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,580
hacker way it's you know for the four or

527
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:37,539
five things that it was supposed to do

528
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:39,490
it did it did it horribly but okay they

529
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:41,190
are brave enough to understand this is

530
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,570
shitty we need to fix it we failed

531
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,279
complete rewrite not like complete

532
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:47,259
rewrite you know what let's pretty up

533
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,519
the quote with the Perl code let's make

534
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:51,250
it more and more effective let's

535
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:54,549
documented complete rewrite as in let's

536
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:57,149
change languages let's change platforms

537
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:59,440
and took all the hackish stuff

538
00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:03,309
translated into Ruby built a new

539
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,490
framework in 2007 and up to this day

540
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:09,720
without that initial failure we wouldn't

541
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:12,279
have proper Metasploit modules and

542
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,080
interactions and researchers and all the

543
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,330
fun things that came afterwards

544
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,820
initially well he didn't have an

545
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,649
interpreter it's like you got you you

546
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,600
know you create a payload send it out

547
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:24,939
BAM done

548
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,699
now we have all those frameworks because

549
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:31,660
of that initial failure because they

550
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:35,080
wanted more and they weren't happy with

551
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:37,210
with what they had but they had to fail

552
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,970
and there's no way that matters Floyd

553
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,490
would have gotten there and think about

554
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,950
all the other talks that were out there

555
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,450
in at blackhat I was just fortunate

556
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,880
enough to be in the room because I

557
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,250
couldn't get to the other talks because

558
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,580
they were packed that are full and the

559
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:57,640
only reason I know HD and spoon and no

560
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:59,860
Metasploit it was because I couldn't get

561
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,750
to the you know the popular talks at

562
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:04,149
blackhat I was like ah you know what

563
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:06,640
let's sit in this this thing these kids

564
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:10,060
can probably teach me something and they

565
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,280
did and I was like a fanboy and it just

566
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:16,060
worked but without that failure without

567
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:20,110
going on a limb without me by again by

568
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:21,639
my luck now I look for speakers that I

569
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,219
was like I was just talking about this

570
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,170
with Chris yesterday and I was telling

571
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:28,540
him look I think besides Barcelona's

572
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:33,070
gonna be awesome I know none of the

573
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:36,970
speakers super excited to hear what they

574
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:39,550
have to say because you know there's no

575
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:41,170
noise it's gonna be all signal and we're

576
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:43,960
sitting you know over dinner last night

577
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:45,370
and I was like getting giddy on everyone

578
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,450
that introduced himself is like I'm

579
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,909
talking about this I'm talking is like

580
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,640
like yes I have no idea what this is I

581
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,800
have done no work on that this is super

582
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:58,410
interesting I'm gonna learn something

583
00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:01,750
new finally this week be able to pick up

584
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:04,300
those ideas and even you know what I

585
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,890
guarantee you one of the talks here is

586
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,930
gonna be about something that really

587
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,780
didn't work or that's not gonna work for

588
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:14,680
you but if you can pick up a couple of

589
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:17,520
ideas from that that is going to be the

590
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,740
best success that you'll have here

591
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,490
turning to the community don't try to

592
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:26,110
look for again this is about making out

593
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,150
the signal from the noise turn to the

594
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:30,189
community because the talent is here

595
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:33,190
this is again this is literally why

596
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:35,200
we're here because I know and Chris

597
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,280
knows and everyone knows I've been to

598
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,260
Barcelona many many

599
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,210
times before there were security

600
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,670
conferences and hacker conferences in

601
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:45,640
Barcelona I know I was there I was

602
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:48,370
speaking there and then they were gone

603
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,930
and this is exactly what I was telling

604
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,840
like the guys I know that the community

605
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:55,660
is here I mean no they couldn't have all

606
00:28:52,840 --> 00:29:01,120
just left within the past five six ten

607
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:03,400
years turn to the community and this is

608
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,260
the literal proof that it can happen

609
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,540
that the communities here the talent

610
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:10,720
he's here the content is here the money

611
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:13,899
is here everything is here this is where

612
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,540
you can find the signal you don't have

613
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:21,220
to look for the noise that everyone else

614
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:25,000
is making if you look at the big

615
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:26,500
conferences the black hats the RSA s try

616
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,390
to look behind the scenes and understand

617
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:34,720
how they work black hat submissions and

618
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:35,050
talks are due almost a year before the

619
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,890
event

620
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:40,540
sorry RSA the black hat submissions

621
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:42,960
they're designed to create media buzz

622
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:46,149
people are releasing research

623
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,280
specifically to get into black hat it

624
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:52,120
doesn't make any sense why would you sit

625
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:53,950
on information on data on research where

626
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,209
you could have shared it you could have

627
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,460
iterated over it

628
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,230
you could have failed and made it better

629
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,180
and better and better and eventually

630
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,800
made it make it to the next black hat or

631
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:07,000
you know what gives a about black

632
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:11,500
hat go to besides I might be a little

633
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,300
biased but most conferences run once a

634
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,850
year do you really think that there's

635
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,320
innovation that gets published only once

636
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,730
a year

637
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,700
screw those big conferences have a B

638
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:23,380
sides have a Barcelona hackerspace you

639
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,690
know the the Barcelona cybersecurity

640
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,730
thing you meet every month I've been

641
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:30,970
there and it's amazing and you can get

642
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:33,790
content talk about it fail over it show

643
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:36,370
stuff that's incomplete show stuff that

644
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:39,550
you know what shouldn't we shouldn't

645
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:42,219
make it to like a black hat or a b-sides

646
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:45,280
show stuff still and work so you can

647
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:48,550
iterate and and successfully fail so you

648
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,960
can get to that final submission

649
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:55,899
tune out the noise this is the most

650
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:59,840
difficult part social media is is is oh

651
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:01,970
god I love social media and it's it's

652
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,250
it's great for some things I have to say

653
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:06,590
something something positive but it's a

654
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:09,860
dumpster fire for most other things it's

655
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:11,959
filled with emotions people are very

656
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,870
easily detached with humanity before

657
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,360
when they go to onto social media they

658
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:21,439

662
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:33,469
using it purely to either troll my

friends and get horrible things out of

664
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:40,670

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,169
message I think that I have noob it out

687
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:43,850
we're all learning things I mean today

688
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,500
in the last couple of days I threw a

689
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:47,389
little conference you know and in our

690
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:52,240
company and now learn new things because

691
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:57,230
my staff and my colleagues and my peers

692
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:59,330
stepped up and put up content and and

693
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:02,420
made a big thing and I was like yes this

694
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:04,730
is interesting I'm still learning I mean

695
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,760
if I if I were to get to a point where I

696
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:10,160
would be like you know what I'm good I

697

699
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:19,520
expert I have a cyber security expert

700
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:23,510
call me out because that's the point

701
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,580
where my career is done literally there

702
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:28,010
is no way to become an expert in this

703
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,389
industry and I'm willing to fight like

704
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,690
physically fight anyone who says

705
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,690
otherwise

706
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:39,020
or at least get someone to fight for me

707
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:41,780
but understand and embrace this noob

708
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:44,930
Ness it is it is an amazing energy that

709
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:52,310
kept keeps me going again I'm excited

710
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:55,790
this is the 498 b-side event that is

711
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:58,460
thrown worldwide since this guy here

712
00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:02,149
started it 11 years ago because he was

713
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:04,130
pissed at something and we participated

714
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:07,370
in it and we learned and we still learn

715
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:10,370
and I'm as excited to you know to stand

716
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:12,469
here on stage and and clear this area of

717
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:15,940
 and let the real people who are

718
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:18,649
doing work talk about what they're doing

719
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:23,470
because I understand and as I said

720
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:25,310
earlier like last night I was giddy

721
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:28,668
understanding that I'm gonna learn new

722
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:30,409
things that I have no idea about but

723
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:32,359
unless you get to that unless you

724
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:35,659
embrace that State of Mind

725
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:38,780
I'm a noob I'm going if I try to touch

726
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:40,669
this I'm going to fail so badly but it's

727
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,260
gonna be so much fun and that's the only

728
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:45,770
way it's gonna get better

729
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:48,740
so with that I just want you to

730
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:50,840
recognize that first of all the bravery

731
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:53,379
of anyone standing here I mean I'm

732
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:57,590
almost done I'm like I'm ready to go and

733
00:34:53,379 --> 00:35:00,710
it takes a lot and to come up with

734
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,720
content and not just like fancy words

735
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:06,070
and talk about oh you should be brave

736
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,350
and fail and motivational speaker is

737
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:12,910
amazing it's absolutely amazing so

738
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:16,480
embrace that recognize it and step on

739
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:18,940
that stage it is scary as hell it's not

740
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,980
for everyone but it is so rewarding

741
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,050
because it gives you so much feedback

742
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:26,620
and it connects you with other people

743
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:29,140
and it enables them to connect with you

744
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,819
and that's the only way that really

745
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:35,290
successful projects and really

746
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:39,010
successful code hacks people end up

747
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:47,759
together thank you

748
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:53,890
[Applause]

749
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:56,140
comments this is not like a questions

750
00:35:53,890 --> 00:36:02,890
talk but I'm happy to answer anything

751
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:10,839
that someone might have nothing it's too

752
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:14,790
early oh yes the teen testing yeah what

753
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:18,610
is that god how much time do we have

754
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:22,540
Red Team testing in a nutshell is full

755
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:25,600
adversarial simulation a are you

756
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:30,040
familiar with pen testing good it's not

757
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:33,670
been testing think pen testing but in

758
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:39,910
the real world no scope no limitations

759
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:44,140
no rules and as a red teamer you have

760
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:47,670
one task which is to simulate a certain

761
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:50,950
adversary whether it's a script kitty or

762
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:53,970
a professional hacker or a competitor or

763
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:57,250
a nation-state you are tasked with

764
00:36:53,970 --> 00:37:00,879
assuming that role in being able to

765
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:05,020
subject your target with everything that

766
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,700
that adversary has in play from a

767
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,200
technical perspective from a knowledge

768
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,750
perspective from a threat intelligence

769
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,850
an intelligence gathering perspective

770
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:17,380
from a physical security social

771
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:18,549
engineering accessibility everything no

772
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,950
rules

773
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:23,380
no scope everything's in play your

774
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:26,230
target is the company it's the business

775
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:28,570
assets and it's not an IP address it is

776
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:31,660
not the URL it's not a database it's not

777
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,740
a computer that's in a nutshell and

778
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:38,069
correct me if I'm wrong

779
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:39,759
Red Team testing do all the things yes

780
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:46,120
more questions

781
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:49,120
yeah go ahead no yeah so what will you

782
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,560
consider your biggest failure the has

783
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,990
helped you the most

784
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,430
it's funny so the the couple of slides

785
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,319
that I added this morning and I was

786
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:58,270
talking about on the way here that this

787
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,070
is awesome we're using Google slides so

788
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:01,480
I can I can make edits until the last

789
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:05,380
minute and they're automatically sync

790
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,270
and this is my latest but the slide that

791
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,210
I actually added there I had the two

792
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:12,130
slides to be honest a one that talks

793
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:14,080
about someone else's failure which again

794
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:18,400
you learn a lot from it's the last night

795
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,840
if you don't know the fourth nation that

796
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,330
landed on the moon was supposed to

797
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,190
successfully land on the moon it's a

798
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:28,380
couple it's I know one of the the guys

799
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,380
that started this Israel had it's a

800
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:35,950
lunar lander or not lander faller it get

801
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,630
to the moon crash into it because they

802
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:40,600
had some failure along the way again

803
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:42,370
failure the second slide and and and I

804
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,520
was all about like this is a colossal

805
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:47,740
failure it is amazing there were the six

806
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,860
or seven nation to put something around

807
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:53,140
the moon and the fourth want to put

808
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:56,110
something on it I'm not gonna say land

809
00:38:53,140 --> 00:39:00,339
because it made contact with the lunar

810
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:04,750
ground the livestream said last night as

811
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:07,420
I was like but it's an amazing

812
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:09,220
endeavor and they failed so successfully

813
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:13,150
and now the media is filled with like

814
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:15,790
kids are inspired kids want to go and

815
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:17,380
learn science and math and we just took

816
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:19,420
I was like oh let's do the math on

817
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:22,360
something that no one has ever done

818
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:26,370
before at that scale in a gravity that

819
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:31,290
we cannot simulate here and my personal

820
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:33,299
favorite failures are not professional

821
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:37,340
per se and I and that was the other

822
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:41,310
slide I had like three so picture this

823
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:43,650
picture 3a like Facebook profiles were

824
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:47,090
the default ones and I want to talk

825
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:51,200
about a learning from the three worst

826
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:57,210
managers that I ever worked under

827
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,919
horrible atrocious and Chris knows some

828
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,360
of them because I was I was bitching and

829
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,460
whining and it's like it's horrible but

830
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:05,580
I'm at it because I think I can do

831
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:08,480
something here and in hindsight which is

832
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:11,100
always easy I learned the most about

833
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,340
running companies managing people

834
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:17,700
managing resources projects all of that

835
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:21,450
stuff from those people because they

836
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:26,069
were absolutely at it horrible

837
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:32,569
horrible horrible to a point like that

838
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:36,300
should be a prosecutable offense and

839
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:38,250
that has been my personal favorite again

840
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,470
and it's about sticking it out and and

841
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:43,080
making sure that you get that experience

842
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:45,060
I know it sounds super counterintuitive

843
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,250
I know that most people like millenials

844
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,910
are like if I don't like my job I'm

845
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:52,410
gonna quit I was like really

846
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:54,600
I'll pull the privileged of you know

847
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:57,149
stick it out there's a lot to learn from

848
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:00,420
shitty jobs and shitty environments and

849
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:03,120
managers truthfully was the best like

850
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,980
management lessons from there I didn't

851
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,009
learn anything from like running a

852
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:10,760
successful organization I learned some

853
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:13,740
but most of it was through that a

854
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,200
lock-picking again probably on a

855
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:19,080
personal note one of the worst ones and

856
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:23,189
I had a major project that again

857
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:25,920
completely failed that forced me to to

858
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,420
create a new attack vector back at a

859
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,990
time I think I talked about it back at

860
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:34,320
the cybersecurity Meetup and where we

861
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:36,060
just could not complete the job and I

862
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,460
had to find a way to external trade data

863
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:41,040
and I ended up like creating a

864
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:45,150
hodgepodge of hopping techniques and

865
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:48,869
actual traded over voice over IP again

866
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:51,809
that's the cool story and Ania comes out

867
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:56,490
but what preceded that was a horrible

868
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:58,980
failure and what I neglected to tell you

869
00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:01,259
was the initial report that we had to

870
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:05,160
send them that basically offered a full

871
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:08,700
refund because we sucked but we stuck it

872
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:12,000
out and I was like that sucks I don't

873
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:14,308
care about the money but I can't go back

874
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,240
and say that I failed an engagement and

875
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:22,049
it was a disastrous failure I mean we

876
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:24,089
literally forgot the money it's done but

877
00:42:22,049 --> 00:42:28,440
leaving it off without the ability to

878
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:36,599
say that I man I got something can't do

879
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:37,950
it a lot of questions awesome alright

880
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:42,630
thanks so much

881
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:42,629
[Applause]
