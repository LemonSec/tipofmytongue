1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,559
like to invite onto the stage we

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,840
bob fernelli and greg conte hello

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,759
greg and bob hello thanks for be uh for

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,160
having us here we really appreciate it

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,160
ah absolute pleasure absolute pleasure

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,920
so first time in delhi

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,800
uh yes yes the trip was really easy

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,960
yeah i can imagine i can imagine right

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,960
and first class all the way i'm sure

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,640
that's right i just felt like i walked

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,040
out of my bedroom into the

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,840
into the uh part of the conference it's

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,280
great

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,280
it's like living in the future isn't it

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,040
so your talk is on comprehensive

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,919
cross-domain

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,320
enterprise threat exposure analysis

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
which is a lot of words that i'm hoping

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
you're going to explain in uh

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,280
short sentences that even i will

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,160
understand uh so

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,000
without further ado i'm going to ask you

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,718
to bring your presentation up

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,280
and uh take it away please gentlemen

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,520
okay

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,719
and can you see the presentation yes

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,840
it's spot-on

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,320
all right super so we have both both uh

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,520
short sentences and pictures so it

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,839
should be uh

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,840
very uh

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,798
go ahead as you say it's perfect for a

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,360
next ciso like me

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,119
well what we did is this is a research

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,119
arc that we've been working on right and

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,960
at first it gets really complex and

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,600
we've been bob and i have been pulling

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,600
on this

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,640
you know kind of thread and digging into

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,559
this subject

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,000
to try and tighten it uh tighten it up

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,880
and as you go it becomes

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,520
easier to understand so i think we put a

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,079
bit of work

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,439
into it i think we can convey it in an

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,039
intuitive way

47
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,880
uh and also a way that we think is uh

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,880
can be extended mathematically and

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,479
rigorously if people wanted to do that

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,079
but it's it should be fun so i'll go

51
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,439
ahead and get started

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,360
please do thank you very much sure so um

53
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,960
well first i i already mentioned thanks

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,320
bob and i are very excited to be

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,158
uh part of this um it's just a really

56
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,000
cool opportunity and we appreciate

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,160
you know being able to play a part in

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,239
besides deli

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,200
what we're trying to do is we we put a

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,800
lot of thought

61
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,760
into like attack surface analysis

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,959
and exposure of enterprises and you know

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,799
a lot of what we see

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,640
we think is too constrained it's too

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,920
limited in terms of the perimeter

66
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,480
and and what is being considered uh

67
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,000
one or two dimensional kind of thinking

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,040
so what we've tried to do

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
in this talk is create a a thought

70
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
framework

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,959
for thinking both uh more broadly about

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,799
what perimeter actually means and what

73
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,920
can affect the enterprise

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,519
as well as um thinking another dimension

75
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,920
in terms of depth

76
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,640
uh and and what we're considering it's

77
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,480
just not all things with zeros and ones

78
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,559
and and put that together in a way that

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,640
can be used by people who are defending

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,920
uh enterprises or really defending just

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,640
about anything

82
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,440
uh and also for like red teamers right

83
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,238
it can and

84
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,959
and other people are in that uh you know

85
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,000
ethical

86
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,680
offensive mode um so

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,040
with that uh we're that that's really

88
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,239
like the the goal of what we're going to

89
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,079
do so we'll go ahead

90
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,879
and get started um no one actually reads

91
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,319
the disclaimer slide so we thought we'd

92
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,399
have some fun with it

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,440
um to put a lot of effort into this

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,799
slide but

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,040
but the idea is uh that we're here just

96
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,799
as individuals we're not representing or

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,840
speaking for any of our current or

98
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,840
past employers

99
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,519
and uh bob would you like to introduce

100
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,839
yourself sure

101
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,200
so i'm bob finnelli uh principal with

102
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,760
capedian

103
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,760
um i'm a computer scientist and security

104
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,920
practitioner by trade

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,040
with extensive experience both in the

106
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,399
private sector

107
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,640
and in the us army with

108
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,640
service at united states cyber command

109
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,000
and i'm greg conte um similar to bob

110
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,439
i've been working in cyber security a

111
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,840
long time like

112
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,840
north of 20 years i have worked at

113
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,159
united states military academy

114
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,200
uh national security agency in usa as

115
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,238
well as u.s cyber command

116
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,358
and we recently were

117
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,198
came together and formed a a company

118
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,880
called competition

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,840
okay so to frame the discussion

120
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,759
it's always important to use star trek

121
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,080
or science fiction analogies

122
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,880
so uh before we get into this we

123
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,800
understand this is a security conference

124
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,000
and in a security conference you cannot

125
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,080
get star trek

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,280
canon wrong so we've tried to get it

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,120
right and

128
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,280
uh because we know someone will say they

129
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,320
were wrong the flux capacitor was

130
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,080
inverted

131
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,840
and not you know not the way you

132
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,159
depicted and then we'll be called out in

133
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,359
q

134
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,800
a but seriously um so this

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,600
is a a a battle uh where

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
they're in a space anomaly captain kirk

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,440
and

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
mr spock are facing a sophisticated uh

139
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,800
adversary in another ship sensors are

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160
down

141
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,240
right so they don't know what's out

142
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,000
there and they're in this anomaly

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,240
and now they're trying to get into the

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,960
head of their adversary

145
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,000
he followed me this far he'll be back

146
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,560
but from where

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,360
from what direction and spock responds

148
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,919
he's intelligent but not experienced his

149
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,680
pattern

150
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,680
indicates two-dimensional thinking

151
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
so they're on on the ship kirk then

152
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,280
gives the order to go up in the z

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,479
dimension

154
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,520
uh 10 000 meters and to stand by

155
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,479
photon torpedoes so the ship

156
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,280
moves and of course it works so they

157
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,479
come up

158
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,599
right behind their adversary

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,159
and uh they fire the photon torpedoes

160
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,960
with the

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,560
expected uh ending right but the idea

162
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,400
here is they're facing an adversary that

163
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,800
wasn't thinking in enough dimensions

164
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,400
they were and they were victorious and i

165
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,000
think that kind of same line of thought

166
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,359
is very helpful as we think about our

167
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,960
attack surface

168
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,319
uh and how we link to other

169
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,560
organizations how we can be approached

170
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,080
so that's really the premise of what

171
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,080
we're talking about that

172
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,840
defenders we think failed to consider

173
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,440
the entire projection of their

174
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,679
their organization in virtual and

175
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,360
physical space and with that

176
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,960
they have a constrained understanding of

177
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,199
their attack surface

178
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,960
um and attackers particularly the good

179
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,160
ones the really good ones

180
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:42,239
understand this and

181
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,240
probe this this true attack uh surface

182
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,240
looking for under protected areas

183
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,440
looking often at gaps and seams to

184
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,520
exploit

185
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,599
so our you know our thesis was is it

186
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,400
possible to create a framework

187
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,919
that need enables like repeatable

188
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,198
holistic analysis

189
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,198
and that's what we tried to do

190
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,198
who should care well there are literally

191
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,319
armies operating in cyberspace we

192
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,319
thought 10 years ago

193
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,360
you know or 10 15 years ago that was

194
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,599
really

195
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,759
beyond you know comprehension but it's a

196
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,440
fact of the world today

197
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,199
we think you know there's a lot of good

198
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,160
work going attack surface

199
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,160
analysis uh but we think it's a good

200
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,639
start but we can extend that

201
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
and it's it's frankly it's necessary and

202
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,120
that everyone will benefit

203
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,039
on the defense side with this deeper

204
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,880
richer understanding

205
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,880
and then with that that type of deeper

206
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,400
richer understanding you can then

207
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,639
uh prioritize your your uh your

208
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,599
security investments security resources

209
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,039
and controls

210
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,280
uh more efficiently and appropriately

211
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,479
people have done some interesting work

212
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,000
uh and we just

213
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,359
because we did do like a related work

214
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,960
search we looked at what other people

215
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,160
were saying we've got some interesting

216
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,919
ideas here

217
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,400
uh we'll share the slides when this is

218
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,280
done and we put links in here so if

219
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,479
you're interested

220
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,679
in uh you're kind of this pushing out of

221
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,199
the attack surface

222
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,879
these these are worth taking a look at

223
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,560
but we think we've moved beyond what

224
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,720
they show here again you see it's more

225
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,120
of a two-dimensional kind of approach

226
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,160
so this this idea of understanding the

227
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,879
enterprise's

228
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,599
threat the threat exposure its attack

229
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,560
surface

230
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,878
links to a lot of uh interesting areas

231
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,280
and we've kind of explored those areas

232
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,319
as part of the research that we're doing

233
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,439
things like attack our ttps

234
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,719
how defensive planning

235
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,279
can take place analyzing your adversary

236
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,560
things like attack graphs the military's

237
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,599
put a lot of thought into

238
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,560
uh multi-domain operations uh

239
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,160
that business best practices uh things

240
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,518
like business continuity planning

241
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,680
disaster recovery

242
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,279
all play a part and then your your

243
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,599
traditional infosec

244
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,439
things like the cis top 20 number one

245
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,200
steps number one and number two

246
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,959
also play a role so what we've tried to

247
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,399
do in the talk is kind of connect some

248
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,239
of these dots

249
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,519
as we go through um first as a start i

250
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
thought it was interesting to take a

251
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,279
look at how

252
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,160
militaries think about like

253
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,560
layered layers in terms of operations

254
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,399
and offense and defense

255
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,719
the us military uses the phrase

256
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,760
operational domains

257
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,600
things like sea land air and space

258
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,040
and that's where battles are fought

259
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,120
conflict is waged

260
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,199
and you know defense and offense takes

261
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,760
place it's a way to think about it

262
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,600
um but they've recently expanded their

263
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,000
thinking so

264
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,279
nato recognized cyberspace as a domain

265
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,839
of operations

266
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,160
it's man-made it cross-cuts all the

267
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,959
traditional physical planes

268
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,240
and there's also uh the electromagnetic

269
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,880
spectrum

270
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,880
which is similarly not obviously not

271
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,800
man-made but it cross-cuts

272
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,959
uh all the planes as well and there's

273
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,560
discussion so this kind of is like a

274
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,839
framework for how the military is

275
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,920
thinking about it

276
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,600
and uh contrast that to kind of

277
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,199
traditional military

278
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,959
uh this is a a depiction of a battle

279
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,800
position in this center in the

280
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,800
the center in the circle you see little

281
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,479
uh little fighting vehicles

282
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,199
right and they're in a circle they're

283
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,120
surrounded by a security perimeter they

284
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,399
have anti-tank weapons

285
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,640
the arrows that fan out are the

286
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,320
that's like their area of responsibility

287
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,360
that's what they can shoot at that's

288
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
what they can hit

289
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,200
they're designed to be uh overlapping

290
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,319
and then there's various obstacles

291
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,920
spread farther

292
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,360
farther out but this is kind of like a

293
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:41,040
two-dimensional two-dimensional thing

294
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,079
uh but there's they've kind of moved

295
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,399
beyond their their

296
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,079
doctrine is evolving and i won't go into

297
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,760
all the details of this but i want to

298
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,800
highlight a couple of things

299
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,720
one is across the top is like the major

300
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,760
parts of the battlefield

301
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,399
physically right and you know and that's

302
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,720
where again

303
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,079
competition takes place on conflict and

304
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,200
hopefully return to

305
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,160
competition or even peace

306
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,839
which you would like right so i wouldn't

307
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,319
worry too much about that i put this

308
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,399
slide up primarily to highlight this

309
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,360
that now they're they're considering

310
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,519
multiple planes at the same time

311
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,680
things like space cyberspace

312
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:24,160
electromagnetic spectrum uh the fl

313
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,479
infra the information being uh space

314
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,640
like social media

315
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,200
all combined in parallel being

316
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,319
considered for their operations

317
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,600
and this is emerging in um

318
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,800
informal written doc doctrine

319
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,480
and here if you're interested in this

320
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,160
type of thing we put a link and this is

321
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,680
available for free online

322
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,760
it's worth taking a look at again if

323
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,719
this if you find this interesting

324
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,480
um so bob i'll turn this over to you

325
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,079
great thanks greg

326
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,320
so here's a question what happens when

327
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,120
you fail to consider a dimension

328
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,600
uh an example would be prisons they've

329
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,399
been

330
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,360
historically designed around walls and

331
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,399
fences

332
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,680
to counter a two-dimensional threat the

333
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,320
idea that people

334
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,560
can walk in or out or maybe vehicles

335
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,120
drive in or out without control

336
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,920
and smuggling contraband items into a

337
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,720
prison

338
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,519
is a dangerous both to the prisoners and

339
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,800
to the staff

340
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,880
and can be very profitable so

341
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,040
perpetrators have moved into the third

342
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,200
dimension to defeat these prison

343
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,719
controls

344
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,360
an example is there's been

345
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,240
multiple instances where gangs have used

346
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,760
drones

347
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,200
to move contraband items into prisons

348
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,639
and drop them off to the

349
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,839
uh the uh inhabitants of those prisons

350
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,279
uh bbc had one story that uh

351
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,760
recounted that there was a gang

352
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,720
responsible for 55 different drone

353
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,439
deliveries

354
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,839
of over uh half a million british pounds

355
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,560
worth of drugs and other contraband

356
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:03,279
into uk prisons in 2016 and 2017. so the

357
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,279
threat is real

358
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,560
so attackers can and will combine

359
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,959
multiple dimensions to

360
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,319
penetrate defenses or to bypass them

361
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,638
altogether

362
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,760
attacks via cyberspace obviously are a

363
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,360
way to defeat

364
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,000
physical defenses but similarly attacks

365
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,320
on

366
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,240
information systems can be facilitated

367
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,800
through physical vectors

368
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,680
think of the classic tactic of the candy

369
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,319
drop

370
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,040
introducing malware through infected

371
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,519
media

372
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,639
that's left to be found or may be

373
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,160
purchased

374
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,240
by target staff members and used in a

375
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,040
sensitive system to deliver the malware

376
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,040
to that system

377
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,279
and think for a moment about your own

378
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,599
footprint uh what's your organization's

379
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,120
footprint or maybe your personal or your

380
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,399
family's footprint and have you

381
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,240
considered

382
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,560
the complete footprint the complete

383
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,320
exposure across all of the planes that

384
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,399
we've discussed

385
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,519
or does your pattern indicate

386
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,519
two-dimensional thinking

387
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,479
and so casting the problem as a graph

388
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,479
can be helpful to think through all the

389
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,839
dimensions a little bit more thoroughly

390
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,320
and

391
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,320
obviously drawing a picture can bring a

392
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,920
whole new aspect to the problem solving

393
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,560
that you wouldn't get through maybe

394
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,319
other analysis techniques

395
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,319
in this case the nodes of the graph

396
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,959
represent informational

397
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,160
and physical entities or objects this

398
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,319
could include

399
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,079
physical infrastructure computer

400
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,279
hardware software

401
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:42,000
information cyber personas

402
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,800
and and people and depending on your

403
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,839
perspective

404
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,719
a node could represent a single system

405
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,320
or a person or an aggregation of many

406
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,360
objects that together play

407
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,399
a given role within your footprint at a

408
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,440
very high level

409
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,320
a node could be an entire corporation

410
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,959
or an enterprise network or perhaps even

411
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,360
something like an entire national

412
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:05,359
telecommunications network

413
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,040
and you know a node could be an entire

414
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,360
data center

415
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,319
at a low low level a node could be a

416
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,440
single server

417
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,120
in a rack in that data center or the

418
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,959
nodes could be

419
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,600
the information resources within the

420
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,399
data center aggregations of hardware

421
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,440
software and information that serve

422
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,440
various purposes

423
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,439
so no graph is uh is complete with just

424
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,040
nodes we need links as well and the

425
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,199
links of the graph represent the

426
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,240
relationships between the nodes between

427
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,519
all these entities that we're

428
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,519
considering

429
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,680
these could be things that you're more

430
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,199
familiar with like communications paths

431
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,000
but they could also be lines of

432
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,639
influence they're not necessarily just

433
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,199
network connections uh the links could

434
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,360
exist on a single plane

435
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,880
like a typical network communications or

436
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,079
they could cross the planes like

437
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,199
something like a human

438
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,959
machine interaction it's also useful to

439
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,279
consider the links as being either

440
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,680
bi-directional or unidirectional

441
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,880
some pairs of nodes may have a two-way

442
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,758
interaction

443
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,560
while in other cases really the only

444
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,120
significant

445
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,599
action may be influence of one node in

446
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
one direction only

447
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,839
so these links are the ways that the

448
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,839
nodes can have an effect on the others

449
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,920
so take a single high-level node as an

450
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,199
example

451
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:38,319
call it acme corporation looking top

452
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,800
down at uh the two-dimensional plane and

453
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,600
zoomed out all the way all of the

454
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,120
systems

455
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,680
services personas and people that make

456
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,240
up acne could be viewed as a single node

457
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,719
however zooming in acme could resolve

458
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,360
into

459
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,880
successively smaller nodes representing

460
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,480
business functions or

461
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,360
network enclaves business units

462
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,279
and into more detail until at the lowest

463
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,039
level nodes could represent individual

464
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,039
devices or individual people

465
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,438
however think in multiple dimensions so

466
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,839
rotating the perspective a little bit to

467
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,880
reveal those dimensions we can see

468
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,639
that the circle that represented acme

469
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,079
in the previous view was really just the

470
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,880
end of a cylinder

471
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,678
the objects and entities on the various

472
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,400
planes

473
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,160
work together and interact to make up

474
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,440
the acme node

475
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,600
the objects within acme can influence

476
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,280
and communicate with each other

477
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,600
um so it's possible you could create

478
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,000
graphs of nodes and links within acme

479
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,760
uh that that span the different layers

480
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,559
and join them together in ways that may

481
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,960
be useful

482
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,678
uh if such a perspective was useful for

483
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,679
the analysis

484
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,240
and a link can be an aggregation of

485
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,399
relationships or communications paths

486
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,799
between elements that make up two nodes

487
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,880
it's almost an analogous to a

488
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,918
communications trunk or a multiplex

489
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,440
connection

490
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:10,080
that bears or potentially bears

491
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,600
a variety of individual services in

492
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,678
circuits

493
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,280
so this diagram depicts that a

494
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,520
relationship exists between

495
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,799
acme and a second example now to call it

496
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,799
globex corporation

497
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,080
and again so rotating that view a little

498
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,320
bit to give us that multi-dimensional

499
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,360
perspective we can see how the links may

500
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,678
also be composed of subordinate links

501
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,520
many of these would logically fall

502
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,400
within a single layer like network

503
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,879
connectivity

504
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,679
but they can cross the layers as well

505
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,039
for example

506
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,520
a persona in one node may have influence

507
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,480
over

508
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,000
physical devices in an adjacent node and

509
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,039
zooming in

510
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,120
one could eventually reach a level where

511
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,879
individual circuits or pairwise

512
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,840
interactions become apparent

513
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,840
and meaningful

514
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,000
it's possible to look at the very big

515
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,320
picture consider

516
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,440
a depiction of the entire internet and

517
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,840
the ability to

518
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,160
zoom into the right detail of level of

519
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,399
detail

520
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,400
um consider how each of the nodes on

521
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,840
this very large picture is itself a

522
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,080
major network

523
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,399
and that each of these may contain

524
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,559
multiple autonomous systems

525
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,160
um in drilling down further this could

526
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,360
reveal uh

527
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,960
major networks sub-networks network

528
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,039
segments and eventually getting down to

529
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,120
individual network devices

530
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,240
and looking at multiple multiple

531
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,360
dimensions

532
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,320
the hardware the information the

533
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,120
personas

534
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,399
the software or even the users that are

535
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,399
present on those networks

536
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,120
so but consider that depicting

537
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,280
everything at a very

538
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,439
detailed level may not be very useful it

539
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,320
could really just overwhelm you with

540
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,720
unnecessary detail so it's important to

541
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,840
find that right level of abstraction

542
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,480
that best facilitates your analysis

543
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,439
and objectives so don't just charge

544
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,080
blindly down the rabbit hole

545
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,480
so i'll go ahead and pick up here agreed

546
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
on

547
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,679
not charging blindly down the rabbit

548
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,240
hole

549
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,159
for those of you that have studied

550
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,159
information visualization there's the

551
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,600
concept of semantic zoom

552
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,080
uh there's some interesting research

553
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,760
papers on that i'd suggest them if

554
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,439
you're if you find that interesting

555
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,120
the idea is that depending on the level

556
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,280
of zoom uh

557
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,719
that varies the amount of detail you see

558
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,280
in an intuitive way and that's

559
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,000
kind of the approach we're taking here

560
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,240
uh

561
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,400
and also on the next set of slides we've

562
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,679
had to fit them on slides

563
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,840
we've had to do some scoping uh

564
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,840
scoping the problem and we didn't like

565
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,799
draw every conceivable arrow for example

566
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,320
we're just trying to give you the

567
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,679
intuition of what we're

568
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,399
talking about um

569
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,520
so bob covered nodes and links but there

570
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,440
are other attributes

571
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,799
there are lots of interesting attributes

572
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,640
actually one that

573
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,039
as we were studying this degree of

574
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,480
control i think is really essential

575
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,080
particularly from the defender's

576
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,520
perspective um

577
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,280
and you know what how do you how do you

578
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,559
describe the degree of control you have

579
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,600
over any given uh

580
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,158
link or node um well we we built this

581
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,320
kind of

582
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,600
this concept things you can touch right

583
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,960
if you can walk in

584
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,600
and punch it uh uh punch the person or

585
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,960
um you know wipe the drive or turn off

586
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,039
the

587
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,679
turn off the device or reboot the device

588
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,799
yourself then you can touch it

589
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,840
uh things you can control are farther

590
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,679
out are things you have uh that maybe

591
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,399
you can't touch

592
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,159
but things like a distributed workforce

593
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,679
remote employee devices

594
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,640
things like that things that you i'm

595
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,240
sorry remote employee devices provided

596
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,880
by the employer that you can control

597
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,039
those farther out there are things that

598
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,000
you may have shared control

599
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,440
uh contractors uh your company's social

600
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,200
media presence

601
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:10,000
so as like you're often times that blue

602
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,280
circle you see the first two

603
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,600
you notice right here that's often where

604
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,360
we

605
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,039
we stop a lot of our thinking when it

606
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,840
comes to thinking about attack surface

607
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,000
but we have to get push it farther out

608
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,320
things where you have shared control uh

609
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,200
things where you have

610
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:30,399
responsibility and uh maybe not control

611
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,440
um third-party vendors come to mind

612
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,840
um your company the the social media

613
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,039
presence of company officers

614
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,840
uh and even farther and and

615
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,799
we we posit that this is the larger

616
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,120
attack surface

617
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,960
really is you really have to think about

618
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,439
the things that can affect you

619
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,559
and you have no control uh family

620
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,600
members

621
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,440
influencers fraudulent personas uh os

622
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,000
and cloud vulnerabilities

623
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,600
that type of thing so this larger circle

624
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,760
is what we're saying we really need to

625
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,600
put more thought into those three outer

626
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,640
rings in particular

627
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,399
uh and then there's everything else and

628
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,919
because it's also like this can scope

629
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,360
into near infinite you know

630
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,760
possibilities so we have to

631
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,600
understand there are things out there

632
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,360
that over which we have no control

633
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,199
and have uh a modest to no

634
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,719
ability to influence us so we just need

635
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,360
to deliberately be conscious of what

636
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,720
we're

637
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:30,158
considering out of scope so

638
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,159
this what we see here uh um

639
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,799
what we see here that is just a graphic

640
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,559
depiction i've taken the note and graph

641
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,840
node and link uh examples uh that bob

642
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,000
had kind of laid out

643
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,360
uh and and created a larger example and

644
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,720
then mapped over it

645
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,199
uh spaces that hit areas of control

646
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,000
and just as as a way to you know

647
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,440
visually depict

648
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,919
it and if we take that further we'll see

649
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,640
that

650
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,480
um i've colored now all of those areas

651
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,600
orange so all of these now

652
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,919
i've covered colored as orange

653
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,918
and i consider those we consider those

654
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,559
as the the really the true attack

655
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:12,320
surface this extended attack surface

656
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:14,960
composed of these uh nodes and links

657
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,480
uh that can can reach acme corporation

658
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,720
we've also surrounded it

659
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,880
with some the gray line that's farther

660
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,720
out which we consider the footprint so

661
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,360
the footprint is bigger than the attack

662
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,200
surface

663
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,120
that's the all the other data and things

664
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,240
that like the projection of your

665
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,719
of your enterprise in in cyberspace uh

666
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,000
in

667
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,279
other so but maybe not attackable

668
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,120
or not it it can't have like the effects

669
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,400
on your organization are minimal

670
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,799
to none um so

671
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,400
if we go a little farther uh we can

672
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,400
consider that there are vulnerabilities

673
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,400
depicted with v's here

674
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,120
uh at various points on your on your

675
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,799
acme's perimeter

676
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,158
vulnerabilities can also occur in the

677
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,799
middle of links

678
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,000
right uh consider an undersea cable

679
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,639
we've heard stories about

680
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,919
people suspicious activities surrounding

681
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,919
undersea cables

682
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,840
uh people have tapped of various types

683
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,320
of communication lines

684
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,678
uh all those lines of communication

685
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,240
across all the planes

686
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,400
all the layers can potentially be

687
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,039
vulnerable

688
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,880
there's a special class of vulnerability

689
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,720
we consider a dependency

690
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,559
right if you're dependent on a

691
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,000
particular link or

692
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,320
external node that's a means of attack

693
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,320
as well i do you know think if a

694
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,840
communication line goes down

695
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,000
if an undersea cable goes down and

696
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,720
you're on an island you've got a problem

697
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,679
or whatever

698
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,480
right and then what attackers do is they

699
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,840
traverse

700
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,080
the links aiming for a specific

701
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,840
vulnerability

702
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,279
they'll pair it with an exploit to

703
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,439
exploit that vulnerability

704
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,440
to achieve some desired effect

705
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,879
now this is the same chart i've seeded

706
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,720
some different uh

707
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,640
vulnerabilities and dependencies

708
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,240
um and you can consider that a direct

709
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,600
attack like i just showed

710
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,880
previously right so you traverse the

711
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,639
link the attack vector and uh

712
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,919
exploit a vulnerability to cause some

713
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,679
sort of facts

714
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,279
that's really what we're thinking not

715
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,799
like an effect is something you can

716
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,480
cause it's it can be

717
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:27,200
destruction or disruption or

718
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,919
you know any any mutant deception any

719
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,760
myriad

720
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,000
of a myriad number of effects you could

721
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,000
cause and sophisticated attackers think

722
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,840
that through very carefully

723
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,320
uh but you could also have indirect

724
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,158
attacks like on as i mentioned earlier

725
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,918
if you're dependent on that link

726
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,080
an attacker can exploit that

727
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,760
vulnerability and cause a desired effect

728
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,199
like disconnecting you from the network

729
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,120
or slowing your traffic

730
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,799
or whatever you can also have indirect

731
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,719
attacks that are farther out

732
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:58,480
there that you can chain a series of

733
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,080
attacks to work through the network up

734
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,000
to the perimeter

735
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,080
so they can be farther out in the attack

736
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,760
surface maybe outside what you would

737
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,678
normally have considered

738
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,000
as during your traditional attack

739
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,240
surface analysis

740
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,760
and that it could also come in from

741
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,039
other directions that these nodes are

742
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,879
often interconnected

743
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,640
if one of them say is a major cloud

744
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,000
service provider or a provider of a

745
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,200
certain accounting software

746
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,600
or whatever that it can

747
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,200
taking out that node can cause others

748
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,639
that are dependent on it to have

749
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,960
failures that then in turn uh impact you

750
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,840
so there i think this is a useful way to

751
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,840
think about it

752
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,360
and also want to show a couple of

753
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,360
special cases

754
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,279
we've already discussed the dependency

755
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,320
but there's also some of these links as

756
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,559
bob mentioned

757
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,240
can be one way information can leak

758
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,440
across them if you've seen

759
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,200
the crazy creativity surrounding side

760
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,840
channels for example

761
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,600
sound and light and heat and energy

762
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,240
consumption

763
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,320
it's pretty amazing so it's useful like

764
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,640
links don't have to be bidirectional

765
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,840
and they can leak information

766
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,520
deliberately or

767
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,000
inadvertently there's also blind attacks

768
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,399
there's a whole

769
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,279
class of blind attacks where the

770
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,239
attacker

771
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,600
uh will can reach the destination cause

772
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,120
something to happen but they don't get

773
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,678
immediate feedback

774
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,320
across that link right but they might

775
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,399
look

776
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,158
externally for effects that are caused

777
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,279
did the web server go down

778
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,919
maybe uh or is it slower those type

779
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,159
things

780
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,279
uh they have to go in from another angle

781
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,279
to get that feedback

782
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,480
now we'd like to extend the idea further

783
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,399
we've talked about looking at this from

784
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,640
multiple dimensions

785
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,760
an important additional dimension is

786
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,159
time

787
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,360
this this attack cert extended attack

788
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,559
surface we're talking

789
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,760
about across multiple dimensions

790
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,760
changes very frequently

791
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,919
it changes actually exceptionally

792
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,760
rapidly

793
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,080
if you consider that flipping one bit

794
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,000
changes the state of the system

795
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,918
this the state of this thing is just

796
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,600
astronomical right

797
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,679
but uh looking at like the bigger

798
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,959
changes and the smaller changes

799
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:24,399
uh that can occur both are relevant

800
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,399
pardon me let me clear my throat

801
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,279
okay um both are relevant uh

802
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,279
big changes can be mergers and

803
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,640
acquisitions all of a sudden you've got

804
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,399
an entire new company

805
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,760
connecting their graph to yours in a

806
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,559
very intimate fashion

807
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,399
right very tight fashion uh maybe your

808
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,840
entire workforce shifts to work from

809
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,760
home due to covet

810
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,520
those are major changes in this attack

811
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,919
surface and

812
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,279
there are also smaller changes you might

813
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,840
patch an end point

814
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,760
you might configure a fire poke hole in

815
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,879
a firewall for a new third-party service

816
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,600
the size of the change doesn't you know

817
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,799
equate to the security implications just

818
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:09,840
a small change

819
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,840
can be very serious um

820
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,120
for those of you who are interested in

821
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,080
learning more

822
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,799
i recommend rob joyce's usenix security

823
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,559
talk

824
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,840
uh where he talked about the patience of

825
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,000
adversaries and they will

826
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,840
monitor the attack surface over time

827
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,480
waiting for the vulnerability that they

828
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,039
need

829
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,840
it might be the patching once a year or

830
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,840
something like that

831
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,399
so just taking this a little further

832
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,240
here's an attacker

833
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,360
um the attacker uh wants to attack acme

834
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,279
corporation

835
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,120
and it caused some effects there and

836
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,919
they they work through a calculus

837
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,279
right what can they see but what can

838
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,760
they see

839
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,279
uh seeing something you know doesn't

840
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,039
mean they can reach it

841
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,399
um then they'll look at what is

842
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,320
vulnerable

843
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,439
what is exploitable across this whole

844
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,240
set of links that we see here

845
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,120
um what's the effect they want to uh

846
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,000
achieve

847
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,799
how uh how much work do they have to put

848
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,799
in to do it

849
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,879
and how valuable is the effect versus

850
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,080
the risk so there's this entire calculus

851
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,640
that takes place

852
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,158
and i want to show next like this

853
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,760
traversing multiple

854
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,360
well here we're considering multiple

855
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,360
layers multiple links

856
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,559
now i just want to show one potential

857
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,519
multi uh

858
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,240
layer attack so in this case maybe the

859
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,240
attacker

860
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,760
works through a particular persona he's

861
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,120
able to infiltrate this other

862
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,279
organization as a

863
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,879
for you know gain some um privileged

864
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,480
access for example

865
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,279
uh and they're able to work through a

866
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,760
persona uh go across and impact

867
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,519
interact with a persona uh like a social

868
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,399
media persona and another

869
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,399
uh in acne corporation which then

870
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,080
deceives the human in some way

871
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,158
causing them to interact with another

872
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,240
human and

873
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,840
ultimately achieve the effects that they

874
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,080
want so that's what we're trying to get

875
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,080
us thinking in terms of multiple

876
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,080
attacking across multiple layers here

877
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,559
and bringing

878
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,640
let's see okay bob it's over to you

879
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,559
right this is yes

880
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,600
okay yes so thanks greg so this table is

881
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,480
is really depicting uh representative

882
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,199
examples

883
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,000
of combinations of these different

884
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,919
planes

885
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,440
and the degrees of control that greg

886
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,960
just mentioned

887
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,039
um in a in a full analysis situation

888
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,640
uh each of the cells in this table could

889
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,720
easily involve uh

890
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,120
research and brainstorming sessions that

891
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,679
would fill a single cell with

892
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,279
many very specific possibilities for

893
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,720
your situation

894
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,480
this is really just an idea of trying to

895
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,760
say well what would an example of each

896
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,480
of these be

897
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,440
try to lay that out and thinking through

898
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,480
many of these situations are going to be

899
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,480
situationally dependent and and

900
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,080
i i'd say one example could be the

901
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,679
monsoon in the south asia scenario

902
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,000
this is something that would probably

903
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,880
fall in the responsibility but not

904
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,519
control area

905
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,919
obviously one can't control the monsoon

906
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,960
but if i'm responsible for

907
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,799
some sort of security aspect or

908
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,039
or operational aspect that could be

909
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,960
affected by the weather i better be

910
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,200
prepared for that because the monsoon

911
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,360
happens and it's a predictable thing

912
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,120
and obviously something that i should be

913
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,879
prepared for

914
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,719
so this was this is just really an

915
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,240
example of those and you may be looking

916
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,720
at this thinking wow there's many

917
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,480
many very good examples or if you look

918
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,480
at this table you say

919
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,000
gee i never thought of that that's

920
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,000
probably something to consider

921
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,159
and i would add that this we've created

922
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,600
this specifically as a kind of easy to

923
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,640
use tool in your own

924
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,399
kind of risk analysis and assessment of

925
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
your attack surface so creating a matrix

926
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,639
like this i think is

927
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,640
you think is a useful tool

928
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,519
so thinking this this through and some

929
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,760
of the so what would be

930
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,360
to get better visibility analysis and be

931
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,879
able to coordinate your

932
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,639
your uh overall security effort um

933
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,480
graphing this out thinking through these

934
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,200
multiple dimensions can really help to

935
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,320
identify

936
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:21,279
the critical nodes uh the key links

937
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,280
and perhaps uh different connected

938
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,480
components or cut points

939
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,280
uh in all of the dimensions to better

940
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,480
identify

941
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,560
your actual and complete attack surface

942
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,960
and from there to be able to implement a

943
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,759
strategy for the monitoring

944
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,480
for security controls configuration

945
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,159
changes

946
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,240
maybe architectural alterations to

947
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,240
better treat your risk and to improve

948
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,479
your overall security posture

949
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,078
so it's not just the more familiar

950
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,679
technical controls but

951
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,440
security professionals really need to be

952
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,119
thinking across all of the dimensions

953
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,879
and come up with a comprehensive

954
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,720
strategy

955
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,480
consider more comprehensive threat

956
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,879
intelligence more than just the network

957
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,839
things but that could include the

958
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,960
weather

959
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,759
as given the previous example but also

960
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,320
things like

961
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,520
sharing the risk through insurance um

962
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,839
cooperation with

963
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,000
government and private sector uh

964
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,078
partnerships

965
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,160
or larger scale collective defense

966
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,680
capabilities all of these can contribute

967
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,200
to a better posture

968
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,640
and will benefit from this

969
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,640
multi-dimensional analysis

970
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,040
so um you know like the key takeaways

971
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,078
right and we looked at this problem for

972
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,640
quite a while

973
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,160
um and we tried to distill down what we

974
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,200
thought was most important to take away

975
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,040
from this talk

976
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,279
uh and we think that it's really

977
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,320
important to push beyond your normal

978
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,000
boundaries

979
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,079
of of your you know thinking about the

980
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,760
perimeter and then dimensions so

981
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,599
thinking vertically across all the

982
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,520
layers which we just described

983
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,960
and then horizontally farther out

984
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,119
thinking about things that can

985
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,640
affect your enterprise whether or not

986
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,160
you have control

987
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,440
because you have some degree of control

988
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,200
you might be able to control the effects

989
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,440
even if you can't control

990
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,000
the uh the entity that's causing or

991
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,440
trying to cause them

992
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,839
and then you can use the results to

993
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,040
inform your risk management discussions

994
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,720
as bob mentioned your threat

995
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,520
intelligence collection

996
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,160
and ultimately uh architect more

997
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,640
defensible systems

998
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,839
so the takeaway here for me is do not

999
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,960
inhale mountain dew

1000
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,200
in the middle of the talk uh

1001
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,800
sorry uh because the classic the the

1002
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,319
textbook way to deal with attack

1003
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,760
surfaces you want to reduce the attack

1004
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,400
surface you want to reduce the number of

1005
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,560
links

1006
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,240
to that outside world and all of a

1007
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,680
sudden but we've expanded it like an

1008
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,560
accordion you've seen that there's a lot

1009
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,240
of links

1010
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,000
and you want to just reduce your tax

1011
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,160
surface in general

1012
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,280
and we think this methodology that we're

1013
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,040
suggesting here

1014
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,520
it's not just useful for enterprises you

1015
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,599
can think in terms of a city this way

1016
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,320
a critical infrastructure sector a

1017
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,240
nation using that kind of semantic zoom

1018
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,920
where you abstract appropriately and can

1019
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,759
move up and down fluidly

1020
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,359
that's i think quite powerful so we

1021
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,200
think this scales

1022
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,400
and also corporate ecosystems all the

1023
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,160
way from suppliers

1024
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,320
through the headquarters through to

1025
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,000
retail and ultimately your customers

1026
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,520
you can consider that whole ecosystem

1027
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,240
in your analysis and we think that would

1028
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:22,480
be very useful and what we've described

1029
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,720
uh would be helpful to that

1030
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,240
so if you're interested in this type of

1031
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,040
type of work we're going to

1032
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,560
obviously share the slides uh and bob

1033
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,480
and i have been doing some nearby

1034
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,599
research which we think connects and is

1035
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,839
useful

1036
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,280
we did a talk at black hat usa this

1037
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:40,000
summer uh on

1038
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,839
uh attacking uh attacking and defending

1039
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,119
countries which i think connects well to

1040
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,759
this

1041
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,680
we've also looked at pressure points uh

1042
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,000
like so basically the tar

1043
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,118
how threat actors target in this kind of

1044
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,320
space that we're

1045
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,040
talking about a colleague of mine and i

1046
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,920
wrote a book called on cyber which digs

1047
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,440
deeply into

1048
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,520
a lot of related areas and we

1049
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,359
teach courses on military strategy and

1050
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,759
tactics for cyber security

1051
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,640
as well as information operations and

1052
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,359
influence operations at black hat

1053
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,279
there's i thought the work by risk iq

1054
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,279
and i we are not affiliated with them

1055
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,800
but their white papers and other

1056
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,599
work was interesting so that's more

1057
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,280
information

1058
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,040
if you want to extend what we're talking

1059
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,280
about uh i think

1060
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,480
things like attack graphs and complex

1061
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,520
systems analysis

1062
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,040
and graph theory have a lot to that

1063
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,440
you could add some rigor to this and

1064
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,599
kind of it would work mathematically

1065
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,160
uh that there are people working on

1066
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,200
automated attack surface generation

1067
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,399
um and we think too that's useful not

1068
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,279
just from the

1069
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,480
uh defender's perspective but also put

1070
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,240
on your attacker hat

1071
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,160
right for the defender has access to

1072
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,078
certain amounts of information

1073
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,319
the attacker has a different set of

1074
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,839
information so their graphs

1075
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,320
those links that they would see are

1076
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:03,119
different but it's useful to

1077
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,720
perhaps flip those perspectives um you

1078
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,720
know red teamers are good at that type

1079
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,279
of thing

1080
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,959
and uh yeah so though just some ideas

1081
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,960
for future work

1082
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,839
and with that i think we're happy to go

1083
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,839
to questions

1084
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,759
gentlemen thank you very much uh i

1085
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,879
rarely say this but i love that

1086
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,040
i really really liked it i have a few um

1087
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,119
folks don't forget to ask your questions

1088
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,599
in the youtube comments fields

1089
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,200
um sorry in the in the in the back house

1090
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,000
can we bring up that last slide again

1091
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,520
please can we

1092
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,119
can we re-share that last slide thank

1093
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,400
you uh no the

1094
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,880
the next one the the uh

1095
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,079
yeah perfect just so just so we know

1096
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,200
where to find you

1097
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,839
um so a few comments and a question so

1098
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,839
the

1099
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,520
attack surface diagram i think that's

1100
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,119
one of the best ways i've seen of

1101
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,960
actually trying to

1102
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,960
really dig into where the

1103
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,359
vulnerabilities of your systems are

1104
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,920
or not in the system your organization

1105
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:05,920
your enterprise your your whatever it is

1106
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,800
um i loved the um uh the differentiation

1107
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,319
between you know

1108
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,640
the vulnerability and the dependencies

1109
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,440
and then the the exploits and the the

1110
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,000
the way

1111
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,040
that you're able to map those onto there

1112
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,880
and then

1113
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,480
abstract it out or abstract that out

1114
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,920
even further into the

1115
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,680
uh the matrix that helps um

1116
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,520
elaborate on those on the risks as a

1117
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,680
result um i mean we all know a risk

1118
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,160
register is one of the hardest things to

1119
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,279
uh to write i think one of the best ones

1120
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,680
i read was attack by wild dogs

1121
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,480
um which was an interesting risk to put

1122
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,598
on the register

1123
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,160
possibly realistic i don't know um

1124
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,640
i did i didn't think so at the time so

1125
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,680
but

1126
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:48,240
you can really you've almost got an

1127
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,000
evidence chain of where those risks are

1128
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,078
coming from as a result of

1129
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,599
the the work that's carried out on the

1130
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,920
uh on the attack surface so

1131
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,800
that's something i'm certainly going to

1132
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,280
be

1133
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,359
um uh going to be looking into more and

1134
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,760
you know in some of your further reading

1135
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,000
my question is uh bob when was that

1136
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,760
photo taken

1137
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,440
uh for the uh the one we're looking at

1138
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,440
that's a few years out of date right now

1139
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,118
absolutely you look um you look uh you

1140
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,319
look like a film star there

1141
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,319
actually my daughter took that photo um

1142
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,319
and uh so that's one of the reasons i

1143
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,759
really like it it was just a very

1144
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,319
off-the-cuff photo that

1145
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,680
uh that was as good as any professional

1146
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,599
could probably put together

1147
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,118
absolutely i'd recommend you change the

1148
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,520
camera on your laptop screen in that

1149
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,560
case

1150
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,640
[Laughter]

1151
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,920
joking joking don't insult the speakers

1152
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,359
they keep telling me that

1153
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,640
um we

1154
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:51,440
do have a question fantastic from uh

1155
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,440
samuel is that

1156
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,720
let me get that up on the screen for

1157
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,119
everybody to see

1158
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,919
thank you don't you think best security

1159
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,720
is attack and being on the war field uh

1160
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,760
dark web

1161
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,759
is a good tactic

1162
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,279
could you restate the question please

1163
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,280
simon you might need to restate that one

1164
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:19,920
oh he said nice question

1165
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,760
um we'll give him just a just us

1166
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,560
a second to to come with that

1167
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,400
uh yes osama if you could restate that

1168
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,480
question slightly in the meantime

1169
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,440
um the other aspect that i thought was

1170
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,480
very interesting

1171
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,040
was you know how everything changes over

1172
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,319
time

1173
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,119
time and circumstances and i think so

1174
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,520
often uh risk registers are just you

1175
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,480
know

1176
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,640
once and done or once and done at least

1177
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,359
for 12 months and i think

1178
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,359
actually the the further work on

1179
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,200
automating some of this attack surface

1180
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,759
work etc is going to make a

1181
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,040
it's potentially a game changer in our

1182
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,800
understanding of risk within

1183
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,119
organizations

1184
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,800
i think it'll tie to the you know the

1185
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,040
ability to automatically generate

1186
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,240
no it's all in the data right like what

1187
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,880
do you have access to

1188
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,520
what don't you have access to uh yeah

1189
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,359
can

1190
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,720
what can you automate what do you just

1191
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,359
not have the data

1192
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,480
or the the authority to access the data

1193
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,400
that you need

1194
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,920
so you're gonna have it's gonna limit i

1195
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,359
think they'll be like blind spots just

1196
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,839
because of

1197
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:26,078
you can't collect certain types of data

1198
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,078
what do you think bob

1199
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,520
yes and i i think the uh the mention

1200
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,040
that a risk register

1201
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,119
is a uh is a difficult beast to create

1202
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,880
and maintain i would definitely agree

1203
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,960
with that

1204
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,560
and it takes a certain mindset to do

1205
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,760
that i think that there are people who

1206
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,960
are very good at that

1207
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,000
and um and can help expand the thinking

1208
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,599
of the technologists into uh more of

1209
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,640
these areas and thinking through the

1210
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,960
risks

1211
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,560
um both the effects and then the things

1212
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,599
that present risk the threats that are

1213
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,160
out there

1214
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,640
that uh that are very helpful um you

1215
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,759
mentioned

1216
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,400
a background as a ciso so certainly uh

1217
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,560
hopefully

1218
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,599
this talk resonates with that larger

1219
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,680
picture

1220
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,839
and uh and it's it's good for all of us

1221
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,440
both the the hands-on technologists

1222
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,200
the people who are dealing with risks

1223
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,599
and management i think through all of

1224
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,720
these

1225
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:19,119
these factors together yeah

1226
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,640
yeah and i think too that i i mean i

1227
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,079
would not be surprised if we

1228
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,759
if we think that there are literally

1229
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,640
armies operating

1230
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,920
in in this world in cyberspace that what

1231
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,960
we're thinking their people

1232
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,359
probably mapped out a lot of this and

1233
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,839
have

1234
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,279
giant you know like attack you know war

1235
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,560
plans on the shelf

1236
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,800
well they have cheap they have cheap

1237
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,640
labor to do that right

1238
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,240
that's the thing you know they have a

1239
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,520
sheer vol well they have an army of

1240
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,200
people funnily enough it's

1241
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,040
clues in the name an army of people to

1242
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,439
do these things um

1243
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,960
and it's and it's a very sort of uh what

1244
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,839
military thing to do which is document

1245
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,359
um so yes absolutely absolutely well

1246
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,440
we've come up onto time

1247
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,279
gentlemen thank you very much i will

1248
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,880
certainly be uh following up on this

1249
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,040
personally to look into

1250
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,280
more of the research and some of the

1251
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,880
further reading that you've suggested

1252
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,440
very much appreciated you get the

1253
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,000
massive virtual round of applause

1254
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,359
thank you very much like i said before

1255
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,800
one of the challenges of virtual

1256
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,319
conferences is you don't get the

1257
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,200
audience response but you get my

1258
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,839
response instead

1259
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,399
so thank you so much thank you for

1260
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,200
flying

1261
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,200
all this way
