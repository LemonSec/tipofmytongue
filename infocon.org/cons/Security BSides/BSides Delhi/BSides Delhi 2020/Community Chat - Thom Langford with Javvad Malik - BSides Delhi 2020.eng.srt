5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,520
besides delhi 2020 in

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,520
a virtual world just like everything

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,720
else in 2020

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,439
um so obviously why are we doing

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,198
a virtual edition uh i think we can uh i

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,759
think we know the answer to that really

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,640
uh we're all stuck in our homes and uh

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
stuck in our

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,280
small bubbles and virtual offices etc

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,320
um but the b-sides spirit

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,280
lives on and we've not taken sponsorship

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,360
this year

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,800
uh as we normally do is we didn't want

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,160
to uh

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,078

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,959
virtual event for the for the community

21

and specifically those three

99
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,920
uh let's see some housekeeping questions

100
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,519
obviously we don't have to worry about

101
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,238
fire alarms or anything like that but uh

102
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,080
during all of our sessions today if you

103
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,120
have questions that you want to ask

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,599
during the session that hopefully we can

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,519
answer or hopefully we can get the uh

106
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,079
speaker in question to answer

107
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,000
then put them in the youtube chat which

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,360
i believe is just to the right

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,040
of your screen uh of or right here

110
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,199
i think if that's about right um

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,799
so put them in the youtube chat there

112
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,840
will be q a at the end

113
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,159
and it's my job to try and collate those

114
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,359
uh

115
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,080
questions and see uh if we can put them

116
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,720
to

117
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,199

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,000
need

173
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,919
absolutely good so um

174
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,199
as many of people who are watching this

175
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,560
will know jav and i

176
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,400
have known each other for many many

177
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,639
years we've

178
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,000
both been parts of various sort of

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,440
communities

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,400
and what we want to um

181
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,000
uh what we want to talk about today is

182
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,479
actually the importance of

183
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,599
community besides is a community event

184
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,800
uh it's it's driven by uh

185
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,039
created managed by a community of people

186
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,160
and it's delivered to the infosec

187
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,360
community

188
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,319
it's not commercially driven it doesn't

189
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,759
have an agenda

190
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:27,599
outside of education and inclusiveness

191
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:31,120
um so um it's it's not

192
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,800
just a conference in reality it's almost

193
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,240
a movement so javad what does

194
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,639
what does b-sides mean to you yeah so

195
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,800
as you said i was involved in setting up

196
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,560
the first b-sides london which uh this

197
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
year it was cancelled unfortunately in

198
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,160
london because of the lockdown

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,919
but it would have been its 10th year so

200
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,240
it was 10 years ago that we started it

201
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,359
off

202
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,879
and when i started it i when i was

203
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,479
involved in citing it wasn't just me

204
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,120
there was a whole team of us

205
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,000
i really thought well this is just a

206
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
another conference

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,360
we're doing and these are talks that

208
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
maybe

209
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,560
are a bit fringe or they're not going to

210
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,039
get accepted to the bigger conferences

211
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,800
so we'll just host them here but

212
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,878
it's not about the books for me at all

213
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,840
it's it's really about that community

214
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,520
it allows you to meet people to get to

215
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,638
know people to network with them

216
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,878
and to really share ideas in in

217
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,400
in in an awesome way and and through

218
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,599
that you you actually

219
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,359
get really stronger and i i'll

220
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,960
sort of joke slightly at your expense

221
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,000
here tom that you know you

222
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,439
you um you got it um for

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,839
my brothers and sisters they they'll

224
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,640
understand what i'm talking about

225
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,320
yeah communities are sort of like a

226
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,360
strange word a thing that you have to

227
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,360
develop but

228
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,680
uh the the uh the um asian community

229
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,640
um is a community and especially when

230
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,239
when

231
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,480
in the uk where i've been born and

232
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,959
brought up it's a very strong community

233
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,880
and

234
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,560
you know there's been so many things

235
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,560
growing up that you know

236
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,680
have helped from like my parents

237
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,279
generation and

238
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,439
who came over there first generation

239
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,480
immigrants and they bounded together and

240
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,200
they helped each other

241
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,440
so much and i think everyone's life is

242
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,279
so much richer because of that

243
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,800
and what what you find is that it

244
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,920
doesn't matter where someone's from it

245
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,680
doesn't matter their background their

246
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,479
education their religious beliefs or

247
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,079
what have you

248
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,760
but what what happens is that people

249
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,200
connect on that intellectual level

250
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,360
and that's what forms the community is

251
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,680
that

252
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,480
it breaks down all those boundaries of

253
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,839
race and

254
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,720
and uh religion and geography as well

255
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,240
uh and and you know this is what i think

256
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,399
something like b-sides or the security

257
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,880
community really enables you to do

258
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,080
and i i think you're aware as well that

259
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,480
you can travel almost

260
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,920
anywhere in the world and you can say

261
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,839
hey i'm here

262
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,199
and you can connect with the local

263
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,839
security community

264
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,519
and it really makes you feel like it's

265
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,880
it's a home away from home

266
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,880
and um it's it's such a powerful thing

267
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,480
so so that's why seeing things like uh

268
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,760
b-sides all around the world crop up

269
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,519
like like like here

270
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,640
i think it's it's it's something we

271
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,000
shouldn't take for granted it's

272
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,680
something we really need to work on

273
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,120
because it's it's such a fantastic

274
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,880
opportunity

275
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,200
no absolutely absolutely and i think i

276
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,079
think the culture of b-sides

277
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,279
as well it what it does it's not a

278
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,279
generic

279
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,600
conference that seems to just travel

280
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,079
around the world it's a conference

281
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,040
that actually absorbs the culture in

282
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,079
which it was

283
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,040
in which it's hosted uh if you go to a

284
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,199
a b-sides in san francisco or las vegas

285
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,560
versus the b-sides in london and versus

286
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,640
the b-sides in delhi

287
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,399
they're very different conferences sure

288
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,000
they have a common framework

289
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,720
underneath but they are imbued really

290
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,800
heavily with the local culture and

291
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,200
that's the beauty of of b-sides is

292
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,959
actually it's flexible enough to embrace

293
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,880
a local community and help

294
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,399
build its local community rather than

295
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,120
just trying to say

296
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,880
you need to be like us in this country

297
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,320
where it started

298
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,720
you're absolutely right you're

299
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,680
absolutely right i think it's so

300
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,800
important for people to to understand is

301
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,800
that

302
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,199
what you're building here is not to

303
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,160
emulate anyone else don't try to be like

304
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,720
anyone else

305
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,439
you you own it and and bring your own

306
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,360
richness

307
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,560
and value to it because that's something

308
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,519
that is nowhere else

309
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,439
in the world and i think if you if you

310
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,959
you know if you try to imitate

311
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,640
someone else then you're just going to

312
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,599
be a cheap copy but

313
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,439
you know you you want to be your own

314
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,399
original self and there's there's so

315
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,120
much value in it

316
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,399
and you know it's one of those things

317
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,680
and and tom knows because he's a lot

318
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,560
older than me and most

319
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
most of everyone i call him uncle tom

320
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,399
most of the time

321
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,399
but um hey uncle there's respect there

322
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,320
there's respect there yes

323
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,600
um so um you know it's it's one of those

324
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,040
things where

325
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,079
um i lost my train of thought

326
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,240
as you get older you you realize the

327
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,199
uh oh i completely lost what i was

328
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,880
saying there

329
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,639
i'm so funny that i just forgot what i

330
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,839
was saying what was your friend tom

331
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,880
we got you on here because you're a

332
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,880
professional jab but

333
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,920
i tell you what let's move on i mean

334
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,560
let's let's talk about some of the key

335
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,000
parts

336
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,399
of how you can be a part of the

337
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,959
community and why it's important

338
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,959
um i mean we've obviously chatted about

339
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,079
this before we we talk about this you

340
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,959
know we we chat

341
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,638
virtually every day anyway you me but um

342
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,000
you know when we when we're talking

343
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,279
seriously and not just telling each

344
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,639
other jokes but

345
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,160
you know we're talking about the power

346
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,680
of the community you know what are some

347
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,680
of the things that

348
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,199
you know the actionable things that

349
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,519
people out there could actually

350
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,560
do you know that they can actually you

351
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,320
know i want to be a

352
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,560
play a bigger part in this community i

353
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,680
want to do more i want to whatever what

354
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,319
what are some of the things that we can

355
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,319
actually

356
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,000
um you know do today do tomorrow

357
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,639
so i think the first thing to bear in

358
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,920
mind is that uh communities typically

359
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,639
they're not like your government if

360
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,319
there's not a leader and a structure and

361
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,279
followers or like an organization it's

362
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,519
not like that

363
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,360
i think everyone equally uh needs to

364
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,200
recognize that you can play a part an

365
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,680
active part and you can shape and mold

366
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,000
it

367
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,319
you don't need to wait for permission or

368
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,600
or uh or go through approval processes

369
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,200
to do stuff so

370
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,880
i think what one one is a thing of

371
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,279
self-empowerment um

372
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,279
you know so if you see something that

373
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,160
you think ah this isn't working very

374
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,800
well

375
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,199
then don't try to write a petition to

376
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,880
the

377
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
whoever you think is in charge of stuff

378
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,639
to do it just say okay

379
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,319
what's my plan how am i gonna go about

380
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
it what are things we need

381
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,680
and then go to people and say hey this

382
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,760
is what i'm doing uh

383
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,279
let's make this happen and as long as

384
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,800
it's for the benefit

385
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,760
it's not something that's detrimental to

386
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,279
people it's not something that

387
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,279
disrespectful or something

388
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,480
people will help you you'll find your

389
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,399
you you build your tribe

390
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,160
so so i think number one is take taking

391
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,160
that ownership taking that uh

392
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,839
uh being empowered and and taking

393
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,880
accountability of it

394
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,680
um i i think it's it's also important

395
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,279
that

396
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,680
um you you invest within the community

397
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,600
uh and that is means that you don't just

398
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,839
show it once a year to a to a b

399
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,600
sides and listen to some talks and go

400
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,160
home and think that you're you're part

401
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,560
of it

402
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,160
i mean that's fine for some people but

403
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,399
um you know you really need to be part

404
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,040
an

405
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,800
active member within the these

406
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,040
discussions and you need to put forward

407
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,880
ideas and it doesn't mean you have to

408
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,319
spend like you know 10 hours a week on

409
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,800
this or anything like that

410
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,680
it just means it just means you're there

411
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,760
when it matters

412
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,800
and you support support there the people

413
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,360
who need it

414
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,719
and you you you reach out to to others

415
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,320
and you share the ideas and and you

416
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,480
facilitate things that happen i mean

417
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,519
this is really how how it all works this

418
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,279
is how it all

419
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,040
comes together and this is where you

420
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,839
really get the value from

421
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,680
yeah absolutely i mean really the the

422
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,480
the power of the community

423
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,279
is or something like besides delhi there

424
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,040
are a few

425
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,320
sort of headline people of course there

426
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,680
are we you know we'll certainly be

427
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,880
mentioning them and thanking them up

428
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,439
through the course of the

429
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,920
of the two days but you know and it

430
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,760
takes

431
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,599
a lot of effort to do that you know you

432
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,279
say 10 hours a week well actually

433
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,399
probably in the last few weeks these

434
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,079
people have probably been putting in

435
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,440
about 30 or 40 hours a week

436
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,040
plus their day jobs right but uh

437
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,639
you know and it's great that that we

438
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,199
have people and

439
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,399
it you know we must we're really

440
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,120
thankful that we have people that are

441
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,720
dedicated

442
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,160
and passionate enough to do that and

443
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,079
there are benefits that come with that

444
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,560
as well obviously but

445
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,920
but there are such small parts that

446
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,199
people complain

447
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,360
um the example i forgive is okay so you

448
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,199
might be very new to security

449
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,399
you might not have any you know enough

450
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,599
experience or at least you think you

451
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,680
don't have enough experience to

452
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
contribute to a talk or whatever

453
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,959
but you can still volunteer you can

454
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,519
still volunteer to

455
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,119
you know in a real event you know to set

456
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,360
out the chairs to

457
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,480
organize the catering to to do

458
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,160
everything like that if you're a

459
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,959
photographer if you're like photographer

460
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,120
then be

461
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,040
the b-sides photographer it doesn't even

462
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,160
have to be infosec related

463
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,439
you're contributing to um to the event

464
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,839
etc but the

465
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,959
but the the other benefits are the

466
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,279
people you will

467
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,399
meet during the process of that

468
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,959
organization

469
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,399
that you know and actually frankly the

470
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,719
the seniority

471
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,120
if if that's the right word the

472
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,600
seniority in the infosec industry that

473
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,880
you will

474
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,000
come across and be treated as an equal

475
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,639
and be you know and and have access to

476
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,600
that person's you know advice and

477
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,079
thoughts etc

478
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,639
will be unparalleled to virtually any

479
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,079
other

480
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,639
activity you could carry out

481
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,319
yeah yeah exactly and you know i i when

482
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,920
i first met tom i didn't think he'd ever

483
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,040
treat me as an equal but

484
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,199
hey today he does and well

485
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,079
well maybe in about a year or so i don't

486
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,199
know

487
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,880
when you're up to standards yes

488
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,439
once you could stop getting me to carry

489
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,439
your bags

490
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,959
no but i have a lot of bags yeah

491
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,919
very expensive bags but but no

492
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,240
you're right um uh go go into this place

493
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,919
so

494
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,319
i i don't know if you you were part of

495
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,959
that tom but after the first b-sides

496
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,240
uh london where a few of us actually you

497
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,720
know you get to know

498
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,160
people and you you just get to know who

499
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,760
which people you like as

500
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,039
as friends as well or who you want to

501
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,480
hang out with and there's a group of

502
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,879
about 10 12 of us

503
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,520
we'd ended up meeting up like you know

504
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,120
over

505
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,720
you know just maybe once or twice a year

506
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,439
outside of any conference just for a

507
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,760
dinner

508
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,799
or something like that and it became

509
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,559
such a good thing

510
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,160
and over the years i mean this was like

511
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,200
i'm talking about 10 years ago

512
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,480
nearly all of those people have

513
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
progressed in their careers they're at

514
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,919
senior

515
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,039
places and what have you and today i

516
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,880
know if i need

517
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,280
anything about anything just just two

518
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,679
days ago i needed uh

519
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,559
some help with some 3d printing project

520
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,240
and uh

521
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,840
i i got in touch with someone who's the

522
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,400
head of security at a

523
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,280
at a 3d printing they have their own big

524
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,440
lab there

525
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,960
and i said hey mate working on this and

526
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,039
he goes oh yes no problem

527
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,200
ask them to send me the the file drop my

528
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,640
name and i'll get this printed and

529
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,440
shipped off to you and

530
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,960
and today it seems like oh you're so

531
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,960
lucky you're well connected

532
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,440
um but it's not like it's something you

533
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,520
work on over a long long period of time

534
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,120
no exactly and in fact uh you know we

535
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,200
were talking before that

536
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,320
uh i met you it was actually the second

537
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,640
b sides yeah

538
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,399
um you know it was the first uh first

539
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
time i spoke at b-sides in fact it was

540
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,280
the first time you spoke at b-sides

541
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,360
as well uh and you know we we started to

542
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,760
hang out and and get to know each other

543
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,360
and as a result as i said you know

544
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,960
setting up an event like this

545
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,840
you're always throwing a few surprises

546
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,320
last minute and a few speaker

547
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,918
cancellations um

548
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,159
but i knew i was able to get on the

549
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,480
phone to you and say hey jav

550
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,919
can you do you know can you help us open

551
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,039
the the conference

552
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:56,320
tomorrow less than 24 hours notice

553
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,160
um you know and uh um

554
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,600
well and thankfully you said yes uh i

555
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,039
mean obviously our first choice

556
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,879
you know a person that i contacted

557
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,200
couldn't make it so you know

558
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,640
and second third fourth and we finally

559
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,400
landed with you but uh

560
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,520
but no no no i'm joking by the way folks

561
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,720
um but um but the point is actually

562
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,120
as you say it seems like almost luck

563
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
or oh yeah look at you you're so well

564
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,600
connected but actually

565
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,160
it's it's through um events like this

566
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,320
it's

567
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,400
through connecting with people and

568
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,080
communicating with people and

569
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,360
all that sort of stuff and actually

570
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,600
generating that network that's important

571
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,959
one thing um one thing i want to talk

572
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,678
about is

573
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,480
the community is not just b-sides the

574
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,360
community

575
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,880
is everything else around it you know

576
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,479
what what are some of the activities

577
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,679
again folks who are

578
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,760
in the audience what are some of the

579
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,280
activities that people could actually

580
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,520
you know potentially do or just a simple

581
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,720
a few simple steps that people can do to

582
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,720
to you know help

583
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,200
not only contribute to the community but

584
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,400
feel that they are part of it

585
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,000
uh personally my my biggest thing that i

586
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,240
i found has worked for me and i've been

587
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,120
doing it for like 12 14 years is

588
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,400
a set up your own blog somewhere and

589
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,639
share your thoughts

590
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,240
and yes and don't ever think that your

591
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,400
thoughts aren't valuable even if

592
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,840
say this is your first time attending a

593
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,960
conference and you're at b-sides for the

594
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,439
first time

595
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,760
um write down how you felt say first

596
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,640
time i had no idea what to expect i was

597
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,840
nervous

598
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,200
uh this was good this was bad i will or

599
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,199
won't be going back next year

600
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,360
and just put that down as a blog you

601
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,120
will find so many people will read that

602
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,158
and say you know what i felt exactly the

603
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,678
same way

604
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,799
or maybe one of the organizers will read

605
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,919
it or maybe one of the speakers will

606
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,440
read it and say

607
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,360
hey thanks for that feedback that was

608
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,960
really good um

609
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,479
let's have a discussion let's catch up

610
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,880
what have you yeah

611
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,320
and and the more you do that so so i i

612
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,760
really believe it uh in

613
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,080
in you know it's just so cheap and

614
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,280
there's really only the time investment

615
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,439
is needed in

616
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,200
you can set up your own uh blog you can

617
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,520
create a podcast with with

618
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,120
a couple of other people you can uh

619
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,840
record a video on your phone and you can

620
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,799
post it on youtube or social media or of

621
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,439
some sort

622
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,918
um but but i think like that the more

623
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,760
you

624
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,679
you give out the more you'll start

625
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,240
getting back in return and what you will

626
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,080
start

627
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,000
figuring out is things that you're good

628
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,480
at and things that you're passionate

629
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,559
about

630
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,520
and and and that will really help i mean

631
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,639
i i started

632
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,080
like making youtube videos about 11

633
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,520
years ago or something

634
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,678
and it was only because i just really

635
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,320
enjoyed watching youtube uh back in the

636
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,480
time

637
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,360
and i thought oh let me start making

638
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,559
some some

639
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,799
some videos that are comedic or

640
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,799
just a bit chilled out but talk about

641
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,280
information security in certain ways and

642
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,039
that alone opened so many doors for me

643
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,879
because people got to know me

644
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,400
and they'd send me feedback even if it

645
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,240
was like hey you were completely wrong

646
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,840
in that video i'd be like oh okay thanks

647
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,240
for that can you help me learn how

648
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,559
or point me in how i get better at that

649
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,720
so i think sharing information is

650
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:06,639
is is i think one of the key things

651
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,880
but i think i think again one thing here

652
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,840
is you're absolutely right because

653
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,080
one i think the actual process of

654
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,480
writing a blog or creating a video or

655
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,879
making you know building some kind of

656
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,039
content creating something

657
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,520
allows you to formulate your own

658
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,879
opinions about things and allows you to

659
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,240
formulate their own thoughts

660
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,159
that doesn't mean that they're set in

661
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,840
stone it doesn't mean that they can't be

662
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:36,080
you know wrong or just not right

663
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,080
um but it allows you to actually

664
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,000
formulate those thoughts and order those

665
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,039
thoughts in your head and actually

666
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,159
realize where it is that you stand on

667
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,158
certain subjects be it encryption

668
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,679
vulnerability testing risk or even

669
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,200
business continuity it doesn't matter

670
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,559
what what it is

671
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,919
um but the the flip side and again

672
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,280
something we've spoken

673
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,120
about before is it's about the quality

674
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,320
of that content you're producing not the

675
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,239
quantity

676
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,678
whilst it's you know there's a certain

677
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,240
truth to just

678
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,400
write it and get it out actually try and

679
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,720
put a bit more thought into it and not

680
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,480
worry about how big your audience might

681
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,000
be for instance

682
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,559
um you know and i'm sure that's

683
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,200
something you you found early on as well

684
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,120
oh yeah definitely it's it's it's what

685
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,880
what you're looking at is in

686
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,399
there's a world of technology and then

687
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,000
within technology there's

688
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,400
information security and then with

689
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,159
information security there's a specific

690
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,840
field that you're you're interested in

691
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,039
or you're good at so it's always going

692
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,120
to be a very small

693
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,720
uh fishbowl that you're that you're

694
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,080
operating in but that's good

695
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,520
uh i don't think there's anything wrong

696
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,559
with it it's not an industry where

697
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,840
you're going to get millions and

698
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,760
millions of viewers on

699
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,678
on your videos or your or podcast

700
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,600
downloads but but that's

701
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,360
not what you're that that shouldn't be

702
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,760
the metric that which you're measuring

703
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,559
by

704
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,400
uh success by it's it's it's all about

705
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,960
quantity uh quality sorry

706
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,080
as opposed to quantity and and again

707
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,080
going back to the

708
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,080
the regional aspects of of it um

709
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,360
you know there are so many smart people

710
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,799
all around the world

711
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:14,240
um we shouldn't always just blindly

712
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,480
rest and rely on some company sitting in

713
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,919
silicon valley to tell us what is right

714
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,039
and what is wrong or how we should be

715
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,240
doing security

716
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,840
because they don't understand your

717
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,200
culture they don't understand your

718
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,000
constraints you they don't

719
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,600
i remember years ago you know this

720
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,159
conversation someone's like oh you know

721
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,760
we

722
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,200
people should never share passwords they

723
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,440
should never ever share passwords that

724
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,279
that's you know that that's just wrong

725
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,640
and you should just make it policy and

726
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,559
okay in

727
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,080
certain countries that's fine if so if

728
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,760
you're in the uk that's fine everyone's

729
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,879
quite private and personal about their

730
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,440
affairs and everything

731
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,039
but i said if i went you know to to

732
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,840
india or pakistan or something and i

733
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,000
said uh

734
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,279
and my and my mom or someone comes to me

735
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,320
and says like give me your phone what's

736
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,799
your password and i said

737
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,080
i can't tell you because of security i'm

738
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,400
going to get a bottle chopper over my

739
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,320
head

740
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,520
yeah but she's going to get the luckily

741
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
out yeah exactly

742
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
exactly

743
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,279
so i think even just writing about

744
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,279
constraints that you feel or

745
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,880
or doing a gap analysis against like

746
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,480
what what um

747
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,480
a certain international standard says

748
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,760
and the challenges in implementing it

749
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,600
and trying to figure out

750
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,840
what are right ways or wrong ways to go

751
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,879
about it i think even that is just super

752
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,199
valuable so

753
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,960
i think it's whatever you want to dive

754
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,520
into you can and whatever you produce

755
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,000
will be

756
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,400
of value to to someone out there yeah

757
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,559
and but the overarching thing here is

758
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,400
be respectful there's you know there's

759
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,960
enough uh toxic people in

760
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,640
any community to ruin somebody's day

761
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,360
don't be one of those people be

762
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,520
respectful

763
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,199
across the board now we've got just a

764
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,918
few minutes left and i want to i want to

765
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,039
move on to

766
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,200
you know the last point um we

767
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,640
talk about this a lot i think you and i

768
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,039
are certainly very passionate about this

769
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,000
about the storytelling aspect

770
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,879
um and actually you know our whole lives

771
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,440
are

772
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,159
influenced and we're educated through

773
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,360
stories

774
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,279
and the same is very true of info second

775
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,279
the communities that we operate in so

776
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,960
what's what's your view on

777
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,120
on the role of storytelling with the

778
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,279
community i i think for for me

779
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,039
personally i think it's the absolute

780
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:19,600
um underpinning of everything um

781
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,879
you know it's just think of it like this

782
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,520
you you go to a talk

783
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,480
and there's some young 20 20 something

784
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,039
year old

785
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,760
guy there wearing ripped jeans a cool

786
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,240
t-shirt

787
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,360
and he's there and he's saying look how

788
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,159
great i am

789
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,120
and i was able to break into this this

790
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,320
system

791
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,279
and look at me yeah and and okay

792
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,439
technically

793
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,960
you might learn a lot technically he

794
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,799
might be fantastic

795
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,960
but you know there's an attitude and a

796
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,918
story there that doesn't always resonate

797
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,240
with people

798
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,440
um you know what's far more useful is

799
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,200
like to to

800
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,200
you know you can explain that same

801
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,000
technical you can explain that same

802
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,320
technical

803
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,840
process through like the story which is

804
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,158
like what are the challenges

805
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,879
how you overcame them what was good

806
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,080
about it how it made you feel you know

807
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,480
introduce some humanity into into it and

808
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,120
some

809
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,559
uh personality into it and that's what

810
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,760
people will remember they'll remember

811
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,918
more about that

812
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,520
and they'll remember you more like that

813
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,399
than as opposed to someone look how

814
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,799
great i am

815
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,520
i was able to to hack into so and so

816
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,520
things

817
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,120
and i think besides being in india it's

818
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,960
a great example like

819
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,600
um you guys have bollywood over there

820
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,880
that it's it's one of the best

821
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,840
um it's one of the best storytelling

822
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,679
machines out there

823
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,678
in the world i mean when you break it

824
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,440
apart what what is a story

825
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,279
it's uh you know you can you can take

826
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,080
any bollywood film i i suppose like

827
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,559
growing up

828
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,480
you know boy loves girl parents uh you

829
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,320
know parents don't agree they they run

830
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,600
away there's some fighting and they they

831
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,000
live happily ever after

832
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,760
you missed the dancing yeah you missed

833
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,600
the dancing yeah

834
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,279
but that's not why you go to see a film

835
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,799
is it it's not because

836
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,559
you know because you know what to expect

837
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,080
you know what to expecting that it's the

838
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,158
story it's like

839
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,279
how they meet how they interact the

840
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,240
dialogue the

841
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,760
the the the the songs the the colors the

842
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,600
everything that's what pulls you it's

843
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,360
emotionally it drags you through

844
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,199
and i think that's something in in

845
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,600
security we could really learn a lot

846
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,240
from

847
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,918
from that so if you can i'm not saying

848
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,039
make it all dramatic and

849
