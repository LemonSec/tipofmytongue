that

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,279
the title of my talk would be five phase

61
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,800
of internal team operation framework

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
kick starting your organization's

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,840

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,840
so let's go to the introduction slide

65

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,840
because of a couple of complaints

73
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,720

74
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,040
related issues so before that i used to

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,760
information and cyber security industry

83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,839
recently i started running a blog called

84
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,560
tactical adversary.io which is only

85
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,640
related to

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,599
address resume nation teaming and later

87
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,760
stuff

88
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,560
so i i also managed two different

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,720
communities one is called our

90
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,280
teamvillage.org

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,000
so we used to organize ctf and acting

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
villages in

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200

called dc 0471 that is in kerala

97
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,239
so and uh yeah that's it about the

98
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
introduction part

99
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,680
and for if you guys need to know more

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,799
anything like uh

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,000
anything more you free free to visit my

102
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,760
webpages or

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,840
feel free to pick me in my teacher

104
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:15,040
handed

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,680
okay moving on to the next slide

106
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,199
okay definitions so before going forward

107
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,519
like before our talking

108
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,479
further about returning and later stuff

109
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,360
we just need to do

110
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,960
a couple of definitions because most i

111
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
mean everyone know about our

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,919
vulnerability assessment

113
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,000
pen testing the teaming blue teaming

114
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,400
purple teaming stuff like that right

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
but still uh we have to do a couple of

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,239
definitions

117
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,759
only because a couple of these terms are

118
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,280
kind of misused in

119
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,759
different different areas so uh

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,880
and and it is always good to do uh a

121
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,639
definition like

122
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,080
i mean explain about what is a certain

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,680
time right

124
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,520
and uh the first thing would be

125
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,040
vulnerability assessment is not

126
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,159
redeeming because

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,360
because uh we can see that in the

128
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,600
security industry

129
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,639
we could see a thousands of rectums

130
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,880
nowadays right

131
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,800
so uh in the beginning in the old school

132
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,680
days we started with one level t

133
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,880
assessment

134
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,720
then there are two kind of

135
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,520
vulnerabilities meant like automated and

136
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,759
manual

137
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,440
then we had this pen testing then people

138
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,520
started to call like manual and

139
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,160
automated fantastic i don't know how uh

140
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,359
what does mean but again coming back to

141
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,759
vulnerability assessment

142
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,199
it is kind of a very very basic thing

143
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,080
it's about assessing

144
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,919
or identifying the list of

145
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,440
vulnerabilities or list of weakness

146
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,560
which can happen in a system

147
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,320
and listed down right so maybe we can do

148
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
it in a manual mode

149
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,280
or maybe maybe we can perform a couple

150
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,360
of a kind of automated scan to identify

151
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,679
the vulnerability vulnerabilities that

152
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,960
may uh exist in a stacker system maybe

153
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,759
an application

154
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,960
uh or a uh like network device

155
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,960
automaties

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,880
and it is not a team or you cannot i

157
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,359
mean for example if you are

158
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,919
performing automated scans and you know

159
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
that is

160
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,198
that is not it that is an entirely

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,720
different field we are all started from

162
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,800
there

163
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,000
and second thing uh would be penetration

164
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
testing it is also

165
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,120
not right teaming because we we do know

166
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,880
uh

167
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,400
the difference between assessment

168
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,840
vulnerability assessments and pen

169
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,758
testing right

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,520
pen testing is kind of very much focused

171
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,520
i mean it is very much focused in the

172
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,799
second goal for example if you are

173
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,758
targeting an application

174
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,600
our goal would be uh like compromising

175
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,080
that application and getting the backend

176
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,319
server

177
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,719
so that would be our goal so we will not

178
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,560
be uh reporting anything other than

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,080
you know our attack path you know how we

180
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,280
got into that system

181
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,000
how we got that access from that access

182
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,080
as an administrator user or a root user

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,360
so that is entirely different we cannot

184
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,359
for example we cannot call

185
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,160
uh pen testing or penetration testing as

186
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,319
retaining that is entirely different

187
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,680
for example uh in the beginning uh

188
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,440
fantastic would be

189
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,120
uh for example if you are looking at a

190
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,880
fantastic report that would be very

191
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,000
focused it would only

192
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,560
explain the attack path uh for the

193
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,800
attacker

194
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,599
uh i mean which was used by the attacker

195
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,160
to

196
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,840
obtain or compromise uh that system

197
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,000
right the target server right

198
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,080
but nowadays uh we are seeing pentesting

199
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,039
reports with ssl related findings

200
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,280
seriously

201
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,280
um i mean if you're uh i get to see a

202
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,440
lot of uh pendulum report in my

203
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,679
previous organizations and before that

204
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,800
so it's kind of uh nobody destroying

205
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,960
only ssr related findings or uh you know

206
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,880
for example ssl letter findings open

207
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,080
ports and stuff like that dude that is

208
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,560
not fantastic right

209
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,719
so that is entirely different and again

210
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,440
pending it is also not redeeming you

211
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,880
know that is

212
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,039
what we are going to talk uh today

213
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,599
uh it is still it is kind of uh

214
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,120
confusing but uh we cannot blame anyone

215
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,520
here because you know

216
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,160
uh the industry is like that i mean

217
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,520
nowadays

218
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,039
the term redeeming the teaming is also

219
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
being used to denote

220
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,120
the offensive side of security i mean

221
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,000
the entire offensive side of security is

222
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,319
being called

223
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,800
as a team or a team that's another

224
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,800
scenario

225
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,360
so coming to the main point what is what

226
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,240
is the rating

227
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,560
or you know what do you mean by a team

228
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,960
for

229
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,720
uh for example uh it's kind of uh the

230
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,359
time kind of originated from

231
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,479
uh military right for example military

232
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,280
professionals i mean

233
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,680
the military personals they would act as

234
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,240
an adversary to get into an outpost

235
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,719
you know to steal stuff uh you know to

236
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,560
uh to do other stuff as well so

237
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,360
it was kind of an exercise you know they

238
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,518
created uh both red and blue teams to

239
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
mimic the actions of an adversary and

240
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,360
how the defending teams would be

241
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,240
detecting their activity and defending

242
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,720
them something called like a game right

243
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,440
so that's how the time originated then

244
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,320
uh in the

245
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,959
in when it comes into computers and you

246
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,560
know

247
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,599
information security the same method

248
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,239
uh was there and it was kind of

249
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,680
you know modified to fit into our

250
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,120
scenarios

251
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,599
we have a very cool experience from

252
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,680
redteams.net

253
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,760
very very very simple one error team is

254
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,599
a group of highly skilled people

255
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,760
that continuously challenge and

256
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,440
challenge the plans defensive measures

257
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,959
and security concepts

258
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,720
for example uh the main difference

259
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,239
between pen testing and the teaming

260
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,120
would be pendlessly

261
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,040
is kind of goal oriented gold focus for

262
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,480
example we have a web application we

263
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,959
have a network

264
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,399
we have a device the goal of the

265
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,199
apprenticeship would be

266
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,399
identifying a critical vulnerability and

267
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,519
uh exploiting that

268
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,519
into uh you know that to get

269
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,279
get into that system or you know steal a

270
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,680
certain file or

271
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,519
obtain administrator or root privileges

272
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,479
that is his goal you know that is

273
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,800
very much uh i mean the scope is very

274
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,040
much

275
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,319
you know uh different very well defined

276
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,880
you know that is only thing

277
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,079
apprentice has to do but when it comes

278
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,560
into retaining

279
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,599
it is kind of a full scope assessment we

280
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,439
are not the attacker

281
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,640
attacker is not only targeting the

282
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,800
organization

283
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,760
it is targeting everything related to

284
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,560
the organization

285
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,279
for example a full scope assessment

286
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,000
means

287
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,120
the attacker or the adversary uh they'll

288
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
be targeting

289
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,279
the employees of that organization

290
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,560
intern facing assets of that

291
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,399
organization

292
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,800
uh for example uh i mean uh cloud-based

293
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,920
as a

294
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,680
cloud-based based asset on on-premises

295
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:39,439
asset then the offices

296
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,920
data centers everything everything comes

297
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,800
under

298
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,519
a full scope or a teaming assessment so

299
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,599
that's

300
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,880
what is i mean that is what the main

301
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,800
difference between

302
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,480
error team security assessment and

303
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,800
normal penetration testing

304
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,399
and based on the requirement many

305
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,640
organizations are

306
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,320
uh making i mean heavily modifying the

307
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,640
rules of engagement like

308
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,839
you know the scope of the engagement for

309
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,480
example uh

310
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,399
instead of doing a full scope assessment

311
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,240
sometimes some organizations are only

312
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,560
targeting uh their or

313
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,000
like employees maybe uh fishing

314
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,040
campaigns and stuff like that

315
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,160
so based on the requirement or based on

316
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,959
the need

317
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,360
the organizations are kind of modifying

318
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,399
uh

319
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,160
you know the scoping and uh making it a

320
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,360
little bit more comfortable for that

321
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,839
organization's requirement

322
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,079
so moving on to the next slide this is

323
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,959
something something very silly right for

324
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,160
example i'm not uh you know like i'm not

325
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,439
mocking anyone here

326
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,680
but uh most of the security sales guys

327
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,120
are like uh i mean services company

328
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,920
sales guy they'll be

329
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,680
telling you that uh for example our team

330
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,360
or our offensive security team oh

331
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,359
i mean they'll they'll be specifically

332
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,760
mentioning that our red team will be

333
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,600
doing

334
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,800
a pen test maybe a vulnerability

335
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,279
scanning for the

336
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,959
you know for you or for the clients i

337
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,079
mean uh that is

338
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,638
not the actual i mean you know use case

339
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,120
of

340
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,440
this team right but again uh many

341
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,920
organizations and many people are

342
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,519
still using the time or a team us i mean

343
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,760
routine to denote

344
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,040
the entire often sea side of cyber

345
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,760
security so we cannot

346
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,279
actually plane them there but if you are

347
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,160
technically if you are thinking about it

348
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,079
technically then

349
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,719
that may be a little bit confused for

350
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,479
example for us for the technical people

351
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,160
uh in our teaming pen testing

352
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,839
vulnerability assessment

353
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,519
a web application secures many

354
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,760
everything is different right

355
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,040
but for the other end it's kind of you

356
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,120
know they're kind of

357
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,959
for example what can i say they they're

358
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,880
kind of changing the times and it's a

359
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,239
little bit hard too hard for us to

360
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,000
understand maybe uh you guys know uh

361
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,200
the vulnerability assessment and testing

362
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,200
part if you are working for an

363
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,880
organization and you get to see a lot of

364
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,440
reports coming from the vendors

365
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,720
coming from internal security teams

366
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,800
something you get to

367
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,160
you'll get confused because i mean

368
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,599
something you cannot even understand

369
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,360
what is the difference between

370
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,959
these two reports you have a

371
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,800
vulnerability assessment report

372
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,319
on your on your left hand and a

373
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,839
pandestine report from the vendor on the

374
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,600
right hand something you will get

375
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,600
confused like you know what is what

376
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,560
so that is uh happening right now

377
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,560
happening nowadays

378
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,320
there is a new relatively new team uh

379
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,959
like it's called adversary emulation

380
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,240
it's called emulating the actions of an

381
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,880
adversary

382
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,440
for example we all know about the apts

383
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,760
right

384
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,480
for example many threat actors are out

385
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,560
there uh

386
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,680
many previously found threat tactics are

387
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,239
right there

388
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,560
emulation means these techniques are

389
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,920
because the security organizations

390
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,560
they successfully managed to record

391
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,399
the activities the malicious activities

392
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,800
which were performed by

393
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,440
a couple of well-known adversaries or a

394
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,319
couple of

395
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,120
well-known threat tactics so we have

396
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,279
very very

397
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,320
very well organized collection of that

398
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,560
thanks a lot to

399
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,480
maitreye so they are maintaining a very

400
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,760
very good collection of

401
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,480
i mean third and uh apts

402
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,120
so we can in in within our organization

403
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,839
we can

404
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,279
try to emulate the actions of an

405
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,839
advisory

406
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,160
for example if you are taking a threat

407
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,399
actor called cobalt uh

408
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,319
you know there are a set of items or set

409
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,079
of attacks which has been performed by

410
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,720
that threat actor right

411
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,920
so we can copy and you know we can try

412
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,320
to replicate

413
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,839
or mimic those actions performed by the

414
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,040
adversary

415
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,600
within our within our organization

416
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,199
in that way we can identify what are the

417
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,720
you know security

418
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,399
counter machines or cyber different

419
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,440
systems which we have within our

420
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,040
organization

421
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,720
and how efficient is their performance

422
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,399
this is relatively ammunition is

423
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,880
relatively easy

424
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,880
like we have a lot of open source and

425
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,199
free software's free scripts

426
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,439
stuff like that are there to perform

427
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,800
adversary emulation

428
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,880
um then we have advanced simulation

429
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,680
sometimes people are using uh you know

430
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,439
uh advisory emulation and simulation

431
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,120
uh with the same meaning uh you know

432
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,160
because we don't have any kind of well

433
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,040
defined

434
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,199
uh you know meanings for these these uh

435
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,399
scenarios right these weights right

436
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,880
so uh because of that many many people

437
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,839
are using adversaries some emulation

438
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,480
and simulation uh with the same meaning

439
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,320
but

440
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,079
when it comes in the simulation i

441
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,320
believe we are also

442
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,519
manually simulating an actions of an

443
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,680
adversary

444
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,360
then adversary might be previously

445
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,920
discovered on

446
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,000
or we can try to simulate the actions of

447
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,759
a relatively new adversary or a

448
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
manual i mean a custom kind of an

449
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,279
adversary so that would be the main

450
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,279
difference

451
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,759
when we are doing adversary emulation is

452
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,000
kind of we all have we are having the

453
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,199
list of previously detected tactics and

454
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,759
adversaries

455
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,319
we're just trying to uh you know replay

456
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,079
the action

457
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,360
performed by this adversary within our

458
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,800
organization to

459
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,279
identify uh the the efficient efficiency

460
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,719
of

461
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,279
cyber defense systems within our

462
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,600
organization when it comes to simulation

463
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,399
is i mean a couple of people are like i

464
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,639
mentioned uh

465
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,160
are using the weight simulation similar

466
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,360
to emulation but it is not

467
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,439
uh similar we can do it manually

468
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,639
we can perform adversary i mean we can

469
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,720
manually simulate

470
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,320
the actions of another adversary within

471
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,440
our organization

472
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,160
uh maybe uh that might i mean

473
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,880
that uh there is no rule that uh you

474
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,719
know it should be

475
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,959
previously discovered at these actions

476
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,040
we can come up with new actions and

477
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,079
we can try to simulate the actions of an

478
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,120
advisory from

479
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,439
you know any number of angles also we

480
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,279
can perform adversary simulation as a

481
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,920
similar to a team engagement a full

482
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,920
scope adversarial assessment

483
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,599
we can call it in the call it as

484
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,880
adjustable simulation but it's not same

485
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,600
as emulation uh

486
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,120
that is kind of uh performing full scope

487
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,240
additional assessment against our

488
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,800
organization uh

489
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,160
that is the actual meaning of a team a

490
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,678
full scope a divisive

491
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,119
assessment against our organization

492
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,439
moving on to the next slide here we have

493
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,159
uh

494
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,799
you know we can start building an

495
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
internal

496
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,119
team for example most of the things

497
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,399
mentioned here mentioned in this

498
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,719
presentation

499
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,079
uh you know these are from my own uh

500
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,760
experience and

501
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,159
from the awesome contributors of

502
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,360
information and security community

503
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,440
so most of the secure i mean before we

504
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,039
going forward most of the companies

505
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,280
most of the cyber security and other

506
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,960
companies they are having nowadays they

507
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,678
are having their own security teams

508
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,679
right

509
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,280
uh it is very common that an

510
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,760
organization might be having an

511
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,280
internal pen testing team or maybe

512
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,000
internal web application security

513
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,918
assessment team

514
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,280
for example if there is a product

515
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,840
company uh

516
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,760
for sure they'll be having uh you know a

517
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,760
product secure testament team

518
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,200
uh they'll be helping the organizations

519
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,960
to

520
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,039
identify the security vulnerabilities

521
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,640
which can be there in that product maybe

522
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,760
if that is a web app that can be a web

523
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,840
application

524
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,960
maybe a declined application whatever it

525
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,080
is

526
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,640
for example a companies uh into uh for

527
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,080
example

528
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,000
devices or companies into manufacturing

529
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,280
so they'll be having a secret uh

530
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,520
internal security team to

531
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,399
identify the vulnerabilities that can be

532
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,280
uh

533
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,080
i mean that may be there in that product

534
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,559
right

535
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,918
so that is very common nowadays most of

536
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,918
most of the companies are nowadays

537
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,880
having internal securities to perform

538
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,240
because i it big security became a part

539
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,480
of complaints now

540
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,160
so after part of complaints most of this

541
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,919
organization will have to

542
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,600
perform internal securities and

543
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,000
vulnerable discounting and stuff like

544
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,678
that

545
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,360
so this is nothing new that our

546
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,840
organization will be having

547
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,639
their own dedicated teams securities

548
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,559
maybe

549
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,240
uh if they have they have a matured

550
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,840
security program they will be having

551
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,880
different teams for different tasks for

552
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,799
example

553
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,960
different theme for web application

554
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,918
security assessment different thing for

555
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,760
in infrastructure and then for cloud and

556
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,039
stuff like that so there is not a

557
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,400
new thing right but what if this

558
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,120
organization have to

559
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,320
uh you know they want to move to the

560
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,479
next level you know

561
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,480
for example we are seeing a lot of

562
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,080
adversaries or new advisories and tech

563
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,840
tactics are coming into the

564
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,520
industry right so what if an

565
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,320
organization want to uh

566
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,360
go to the next level so i think this

567
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,918
talk would be

568
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,799
helpful for you know that kind of

569
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,640
audience

570
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,360
who is trying to set up their own

571
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,720
internal red team

572
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,360
no into the next slide okay

573
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,400
so uh this is the very first slide

574
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,719
regarding internal

575
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,880
team operations framework so i would not

576
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,039
call this as a framework you know that

577
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,960
that actually came into flow you know

578
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,840
you know i would not name it as a

579
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,360
framework

580
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,559
it's kind of a couple of steps to create

581
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,559
your own internal team operations uh

582
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,720
that's what is that is the actual

583
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,760
meaning of i mean actual purpose of this

584
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,679
talk

585
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,679
then uh i mean i don't know why i put

586
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,559
framework but still uh you know it's a

587
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,200
well-defined set of steps so that you

588
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,918
can follow that steps and actions to

589
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,679
create your own offensive security team

590
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,600
within your organization

591
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,960
so i have divided that into five

592
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,000
different phases

593
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,720
because we know that for example in

594
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,720
all of the organizations we not build

595
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,760
something from the scratch to fully

596
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,799
mature

597
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,720
uh step within a couple of months right

598
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,158
so we need to afford everything for if

599
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,760
you are making a product

600
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,440
if you are doing internal security

601
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,320
assessment maybe you are if you are

602
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,320
creating uh

603
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,480
something up something else so

604
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,678
everything needs to be

605
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,080
perfectly aligned with the timeline

606
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,600
and that needs to be communicated with

607
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,080
the management right

608
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,280
so because of without the management or

609
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,120
without the funding

610
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,320
we cannot do anything within within an

611
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,120
organization if there is

612
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,480
any organization so that's the reason i

613
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,120
had to split that into

614
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,679
different different set of faces because

615
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,918
uh

616
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,039
even if we are i mean we nowadays we are

617
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,200
using

618
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,280
agile platforms right agile frameworks

619
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,960
right you know to get things done

620
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,480
so something like that so it will be

621
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,799
easier for us to

622
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,760
build stuff into different set of items

623
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,039
then follow

624
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,400
concentrate on a simple tactical packs

625
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:27,760
so here we have five different faces

626
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,000
face onto phase five i really wanted to

627
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,640
put you know superman's picture in these

628
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,799
slides for example a baby superman

629
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,400
then a teenage superman then you know he

630
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,760
learns to walk and

631
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,960
run then eventually uh he starts to fly

632
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,039
but i could not find a decent guy who

633
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,280
you know who could do that right for

634
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,960
example creating a baby superman to a

635
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,879
fully mature superman

636
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,559
so that's the reason i had to use this

637
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,200
picture

638
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,678
and go into the phase one

639
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,919
so here we have internal team operation

640
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,240
space one which is scoring

641
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,280
this is very much important because

642
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,480
these are the

643
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,280
foundation of building an internal uh

644
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,880
team or internal offensive security team

645
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,039
the very first thing would be

646
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,000
define the practical goals and

647
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,640
objectives

648
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,120
every or every organization would be

649
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,679
having different set of business

650
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,760
concepts business different set of

651
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,320
business goals and stuff like that

652
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,200
so your internal team internal offensive

653
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,559
team's goals

654
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,960
must be aligned with your organization's

655
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,480
goal

656
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,640
that is very very much important

657
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,720
and second thing would be getting the

658
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
budget approval uh for example you need

659
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,480
to come up with a plan uh how are you

660
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,919
going to uh you know take care of this

661
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,440
team how are you going to

662
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,440
build the team what is that what are the

663
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,919
timelines what are the tools required

664
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,000
what are what are the team size how much

665
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,360
people what is the manpower record stuff

666
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,600
like that then you need to get the

667
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,158
budget approval

668
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,439
and thirdly you need to identify the

669
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,679
crown jewels and

670
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,159
people for example if you are creating

671
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,880
an internal frenzy secular team

672
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,720
uh you need to understand right so what

673
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,960
is your organization's uh

674
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,640
initial uh you know business or their

675
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,440
area of uh you know

676
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,360
activities then you need to identify

677
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,280
what are your organization's critical

678
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,559
assets or crown jewels so if it is a

679
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,440
manufacturing company

680
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,480
that would be their their ip right their

681
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,480
secrets right

682
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,280
if it is a product company that would be

683
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,280
their source code or is your crown jewel

684
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,639
if it is a services company then it is

685
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,720
their techniques and other stuff

686
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,520
you know that is their counselors so

687
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,080
based on your organization's

688
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,039
industrial you know uh industry then you

689
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,080
need to identify the councils and people

690
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,640
uh i i said people because uh most of

691
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,399
the business have their own you know uh

692
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,240
like executive people right they may be

693
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,559
a target most of the time so we need to

694
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,679
come

695
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,960
identify the councils assad's and people

696
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,799
of that your organization then you need

697
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,679
to come up with our rules of engagement

698
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,000
how are you great

699
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,880
trying to create this in general team

700
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,600
that is only

701
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,159
uh is it going to be only internal or

702
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,959
are we

703
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,360
are we trying to do our time to access

704
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,760
the

705
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,240
same organization other locations as

706
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,080
well from an external facing or internal

707
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,200
facing only stuff like that and number

708
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,960
of things are there

709
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,799
so you need to create uh rules of

710
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,279
engagement that is very very much

711
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,279
important then reporting an other

712
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,400
process documentation of

713
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,400
i mean that is all related to paperwork

714
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,080
and it is also a critical one or you

715
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,720
know ro needs to be

716
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,720
uh reviewed by uh i mean higher

717
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,000
management and legal department that is

718
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,400
very critical

719
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,120
i will show you an example

720
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,039
it happened last year 2019 uh you know

721
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,719
there is a company called called fire

722
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,640
security that is very

723
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,240
uh one of the uh you know major players

724
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,120
in the in the offensive security

725
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,840
industry

726
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,799
so a two of their uh consultants were

727
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,760
arrested

728
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,400
during a physical security assessment uh

729
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,879
because

730
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,640
you know for example you can read about

731
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,279
in their call first block

732
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,600
and testoster can also uh you know

733
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,400
publish their blog regarding that

734
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,000
it happened because you know a couple of

735
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,320
misunderstanding and stuff

736
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,360
like that so we need to make sure we

737
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,000
always have

738
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,479
proper escalation and proper point of

739
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,559
contact and strong legal documentation

740
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,760
rule of rules of engagement stuff

741
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,480
etcetera etcetera

742
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,760
that is very much important to prevent

743
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,840
stuff like that from

744
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,240
being happening so uh there is a episode

745
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,199
from

746
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,200
uh darknet diaries unnamed the

747
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,279
courthouse or you can uh

748
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,960
i mean listen to that episode that is a

749
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,240
very awesome episode where these two

750
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,400
consultants are

751
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,279
explaining about their experiences which

752
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,080
happened during

753
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,120
that assessment also after that incident

754
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,760
practice

755
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,520
uh published uh of their documentation

756
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,080
for physical security testament which is

757
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,918
a good

758
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,678
reference and don't forget to hear

759
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,600
listen to that episode from

760
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,159
our documentary that is that is really

761
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,080
really awesome

762
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,600
okay then you'll have to understand the

763
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,600
technologies in use uh

764
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,879
within your organization on i mean

765
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,520
internal infrastructure

766
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,960
the devices hardware devices other than

767
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,840
cloud infrastructure are we

768
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,720
totally relying into relying on aws

769
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,918
infrastructure

770
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,919
or actual stuff like that then what is

771
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,640
the active dirty implementation what is

772
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,320
the

773
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,760
uh what are the devices which is being

774
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,760
used within the organization

775
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,000
and you know all the technologies which

776
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,559
are in use within your organization that

777
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,640
that is very critical then understand

778
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,320
the security post of your organization

779
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,799
uh this is recommended because

780
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,840
uh it is not magic right you need to

781
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,960
understand your

782
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,240
own organization's security porsche

783
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,320
along with the weakness uh for example

784
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,320
of the end user laptops

785
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,559
the end user laptops are they're only

786
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,000
having an antivirus software

787
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,720
or are they having edr or do they have

788
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,520
epm

789
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,080
uh i mean endpoint uh privilege manager

790
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,799
i mean

791
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,678
endpoint uh privilege manager tools to

792
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,600
improve the security are they having dlp

793
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,679
are they having internet level proxies

794
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,360
to prevent outbound traffic stuff like

795
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,760
that so you need to

796
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,678
understand the the entire security post

797
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,240
of your organization uh you know what is

798
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,080
the

799
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,279
attack surface from the cloud what are

800
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,520
suffers from the internet

801
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,880
so that is a very very long process you

802
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,200
need to understand that that is very

803
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,799
critical

804
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:40,080
and hire the talent because uh

805
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,520
i mean if you have i mean a lot of

806
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,240
budget and stuff like that

807
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,320
you need to get uh awesome people for

808
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,279
the job right talent is everything you

809
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,639
need to

810
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:54,480
uh hire the talent uh in a in a very

811
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:58,080
very efficient way i i always

812
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,960
showcase this slide as an example of

813
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,279
a perfect team because uh this from a

814
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,520
show

815
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,720
called uh you know the a team i mean i'm

816
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,918
not talking about the new

817
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,120
a team it's a the old one so if you're

818
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,760
looking at uh

819
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,639
camera handyman he's a leader right also

820
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,039
at the same time he's a solo player

821
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,919
all of this his teammates they have they

822
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,039
are skilled in

823
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,240
different set of areas they can uh do

824
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,640
stuff as solo

825
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,320
and they can work as a team uh which

826
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,440
would be kind of a false multiplayer

827
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,399
thing right

828
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,760
so uh your team must be uh similar to

829
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,479
this or you know they'll be you

830
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,240
must be having people who are uh very

831
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,760
much skilled in different set of

832
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,360
technologies and uh you know other stuff

833
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,320
and uh i mean you also always try to

834
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,399
include someone

835
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,720
uh someone is non-technical or someone

836
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,399
is not from the security industry

837
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,640
or you know from someone from not some

838
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,719
fargo someone uh who is

839
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,399
not from the offensive security industry

840
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,799
because just imagine

841
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,479
a bunch of hardcore technical guys are

842
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,080
writing a phishing campaign email you

843
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,640
know that would not look good

844
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,600
so for that matter it is always good to

845
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,840
have

846
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,360
other non-technical people such as hr or

847
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,480
someone in your team

848
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,799
uh you know as an address also there is

849
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,600
one more thing uh for example

850
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,918
in my team uh maybe i'm not also good as

851
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,439
uh

852
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,080
good in writing shell card or creating

853
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,679
uh new command and control programs or

854
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,000
something like that maybe someone in my

855
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,159
team

856
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,200
maybe my team member is very much

857
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,279
skilled in uh

858
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,880
writing shell code and creating custom

859
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,000
malware binaries

860
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,080
so that is one thing so uh

861
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,399
all i have to do is maybe the operators

862
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,480
in the team all they have to do is

863
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,279
get that code which is written by your

864
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,360
teammate and put it put that into use

865
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,440
right so that is called teamwork and

866
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,879
there should not be no place for ego

867
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,799
within your team because

868
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,159
everyone is killed in uh you know their

869
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,480
own area and

870
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,760
you know as a team uh everything should

871
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,600
comes under

872
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:04,720
a single entity and you know put it

873
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,719
in a good manner

874
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,039
um going to the next slide

875
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,360
i i forgot to mention one more thing uh

876
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,039
when it comes to your team

877
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,000
of i mean the team must be the team and

878
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,120
team members

879
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,080
must be able to walk under excessive

880
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,158
amount of pressure

881
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,279
that is one more critical thing because

882
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,679
nowadays we can

883
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,320
i i personally seeing that many people

884
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,720
are many

885
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,799
many new people they cannot handle the

886
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,440
pressure uh maybe during an assessment

887
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,600
uh you know

888
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,520
during if they are doing something

889
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,360
individually uh they cannot actually

890
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,559
handle the pressure uh you know that is

891
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,799
one critical thing

892
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,279
that t members must be able to work

893
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,559
under excessive amount of pressure

894
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:55,279
that is very much recommended

895
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,080
go into the next slide so this is the

896
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,240
phase two

897
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,439
of your internal team operations

898
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,120
framework

899
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,120
the very first thing would be uh

900
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,719
creating external infrastructure red

901
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,760
team infrastructure

902
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,039
so uh that is a

903
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,320
very very uh critical on i'll show you

904
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,840
an example

905
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,158
so i got this uh the basic image from

906
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,039
blue screen blue screen of jeff.com you

907
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,440
know he's

908
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,559
a nice guy who is writing a lot of

909
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,399
articles related to

910
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,600
team infrastructure and stuff you know

911
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,080
similar to i mean

912
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,158
stuff similar to uh with respect to a

913
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,360
team teaming and later stuff

914
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,320
so i got this uh diagram from that

915
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,559
website and

916
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,158
i made a couple of modifications this is

917
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,480
kind of a very basic

918
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,799
uh infrastructure which can be used for

919
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,559
uh your organization

920
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,158
i mean to attack your to simulate the

921
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,799
actions of an advisory

922
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,799
against your organization so for example

923
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,399
we have a victim here

924
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,320
and a different set of like surveys are

925
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,360
hosted each server is

926
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,200
uh i mean circuit with a revised proxy

927
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,719
or a redirector

928
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,440
right for example uh the corporate user

929
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,519
is having

930
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,799
uh i mean that your organization is

931
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,399
having a routine right

932
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,000
i don't know if your payload or one of

933
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,840
your phishing campaign

934
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,600
got flagged and your blue team is

935
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,799
performing investigation against that

936
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,799
domain

937
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,639
if they are finding out that this domain

938
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,480
is related to a certain ip they will be

939
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,519
blacklisting that domain and an ip

940
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,919
address right

941
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,039
so you need to secure your actual uh

942
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,080
command and control

943
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,200
and service behind the redirections so

944
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,678
even even if they're

945
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,360
uh blacklisting or blocking that would

946
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,880
be that domain name

947
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,240
and uh that redirect is right that

948
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,559
release proxies so i mean this topic

949
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,640
the infrastructure itself uh we can

950
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,120
spend uh a couple of hours to explain

951
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,440
about

952
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,959
the the infrastructure itself and i

953
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,120
heavily suggest

954
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,480
uh if you are hosting this i heavily

955
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,959
suggest using

956
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,320
uh cloud service power day such as aws

957
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,559
and azure

958
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,960
because nowadays most of the

959
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:07,678
organizations are moving into cloud

960
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,679
like office 365 and aws right

961
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,640
and for example if you're hosting a

962
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,200
command and controlled server

963
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:19,919
in an aws ip with aws url and it is

964
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,240
uh and the chances are the traffic will

965
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,399
be

966
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,519
uh you know going out out of the

967
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,799
firewall maybe

968
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,320
most of the organizations are

969
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,600
whitelisting issued domains and aws are

970
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,840
domain names

971
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,879
and for example if you want to host a

972
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,639
malware binary

973
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,640
and you know execute a new laptop or

974
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,279
actually download it in your laptop

975
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,440
uh the very easiest way would be uh

976
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,279
uploading that into an s3 bucket

977
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,360
for example i mean more if your

978
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:48,480
organization see organization is

979
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,719
heavily relying on on aws services

980
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,559
then things are most likely they will be

981
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,960
allowing s3 packets that you also

982
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,760
see three practice right so i mean this

983
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,720
in this

984
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,200
creation of instructor itself will be a

985
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,480
whole

986
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,120
or different new talk and this is a you

987
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,760
know basic

988
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,840
uh setup going back to the previous

989
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,840
slide

990
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,079
okay 15 minutes and also be friends with

991
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,040
your organization's blue team because

992
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,079
uh if you're considering any

993
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,159
organizations

994
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,359
their blue team will be having all the

995
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,760
fancy tools

996
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,719
like all the enterprise level tools

997
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,760
they'll be having

998
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,839
a a sim tool they'll be having edr

999
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,000
console they'll be having dlp console

1000
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,918
epm console pm console

1001
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,440
they're having all these cool tools

1002
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,199
right so it is

1003
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,440
essential to uh be friends with your

1004
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,520
organization cyber defense team so that

1005
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,440
you can also learn you can also identify

1006
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,679
how are these blue team is

1007
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,639
identifying your activities blocking it

1008
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,960
defending it

1009
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,800
so that is very critical then the

1010
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,119
emulation part again the dust

1011
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,639
elimination part itself can be

1012
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,800
a whole new talk so uh there are two uh

1013
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,320
well-known open source uh tools out

1014
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,280
there called automatically team and

1015
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,560
caldera

1016
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,400
so you can emulate the actions of a well

1017
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,400
previously known adversary within your

1018
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,000
organization and uh

1019
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,440
you can also have a look at the

1020
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,520
detection reports

1021
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,880
which came from the blue team and you

1022
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,920
can identify the gaps

1023
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,960
this is very relatably easy task then

1024
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,119
validate the current difference

1025
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,400
mechanisms with blue team from metric

1026
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,240
this is relatively

1027
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,400
because recently metra has launched a

1028
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,439
new project called shield.mitre

1029
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,800
that is kind of it has a set of nice use

1030
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,320
cases which can be used for the blue

1031
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,119
teams

1032
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,560
then kind of manual campaigns and again

1033
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,079
external attacks are first discovered

1034
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,560
that is important because

1035
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,880
of the real attack is they'll be

1036
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,960
assessing your organization's internal

1037
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,560
i mean externally facing assets right

1038
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,240
how many web applications our

1039
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,320
internet phase how many services are

1040
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,078
there uh you know

1041
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,000
what are the assets which are internet

1042
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,000
facing uh that's kind of an entry point

1043
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,040
of an addition so that is also critical

1044
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,040
phase three here

1045
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,640
uh we will come up with a set of

1046
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,079
improved ttps

1047
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,200
for example uh we we spent

1048
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,720
uh some some time to understand the

1049
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,480
current security cost of your

1050
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,480
organization right

1051
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,320
for example if your organization is

1052
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,119
blocking the execution of powershell

1053
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,599
scripts

1054
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,280
or they are blocking powershell.exe to

1055
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,320
uh you know prevent you from executing

1056
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,200
position scripts

1057
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,320
you can try with unmanaged partial skips

1058
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,560
maybe you can check

1059
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,400
you can validate whether the unmanaged

1060
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,920
powershell scripts are being

1061
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,520
detected by your organization's

1062
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,520
antivirus or area

1063
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,759
so stuff like that always come up with

1064
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,400
improved ttps

1065
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,040
then identify eradicate findings with

1066
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,079
respect to

1067
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,839
because in the previous step we found

1068
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,200
the crown jewels and people of your

1069
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,599
organization right

1070
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,598
now we need to patch those identified

1071
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,839
previously identified vulnerabilities

1072
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,240
for example a couple of senior

1073
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,920
executives of your organization

1074
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,160
they are not using two-factor

1075
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,240
authentication for their email services

1076
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,879
or our critical uh

1077
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,319
dashboard if your company so we can

1078
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,720
address them to use

1079
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,640
i mean address them to enforce the use

1080
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,959
of two-factor authentication

1081
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,560
for all of their accounts so it's things

1082
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,320
like that

1083
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,880
the evaluation of instant response

1084
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,720
process automated adversary emulation

1085
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,280
because in the previous step we did

1086
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,598
autumn

1087
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,200
adversary emulation now we can do it

1088
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,960
periodically like you know every time we

1089
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,118
can automate and we can

1090
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,800
within uh you know a certain time of

1091
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,720
interval we can uh perform

1092
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,640
automated emulation then improvised rto

1093
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,480
process documentation because

1094
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,000
when we reach phase three we would be

1095
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,560
having a set of

1096
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,240
uh objectives and we'll be having set of

1097
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,240
items in your hand right

1098
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,839
based on that we can come up with an

1099
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,680
improvised version of red team

1100
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,680
operations documentation and process

1101
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,680
go into the phase four

1102
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,520
so again all these items are all these

1103
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,560
steps or the sub point which i had

1104
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,359
mentioned

1105
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,839
uh they can be you know a new talk

1106
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,160
because

1107
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,279
they can be uh you know very very uh

1108
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,118
long set of items long set of tasks

1109
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,599
this is not an easy thing right building

1110
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,400
a team from a scratch

1111
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,400
so here uh one important item is here

1112
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,200
collaborative and continuous purple team

1113
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,400
exercises

1114
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,160
so purple team it is uh kind of you know

1115
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,760
trending nowadays because

1116
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,920
every organizations have to uh identify

1117
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,599
the effectiveness of their security

1118
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,320
measures effectiveness of their cyber

1119
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,640
defense

1120
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,359
teams so it's like the teams are

1121
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,240
actually

1122
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,680
helping them because all the adversarial

1123
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,078
actions performed by the

1124
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,160
team it is there to enhance the

1125
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,240
capabilities of your blue team

1126
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,319
right because everything will be repo

1127
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,160
every every for example you found a way

1128
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,560
to bypass an antivirus you found a way

1129
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,359
to

1130
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,359
bypass edr you found that a couple of

1131
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:58,720
security policies are not well confirmed

1132
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,400
in your organization

1133
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,078
everything will be handed over to blue

1134
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,520
team and it will enhance their

1135
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,000
capabilities they will be

1136
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,640
fortifying their capabilities right so

1137
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,040
that is

1138
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,920
the end goal of being uh in

1139
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,160
international team

1140
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,040
your end goal would be enhancing the

1141
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,200
capabilities so

1142
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,440
your company is bloating always keep

1143
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,359
that in mind

1144
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,960
so again uh enterprise tooling

1145
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,119
capabilities or in the beginning

1146
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,480
we are using open source tools and stuff

1147
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,880
like that right now we can

1148
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,520
when we reach phase four i kind of you

1149
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,680
know a

1150
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,119
higher phase is there right so we can

1151
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,279
move on to enterprise tooling

1152
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,280
capabilities or maybe instead of using

1153
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,720
free command and control such as uh

1154
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,200
empire uh

1155
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,319
count and uh we can move on to cobalt

1156
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,359
strike

1157
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,560
then immunity canvas uh then i know

1158
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,560
other enterprise getting tools

1159
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,040
then the important uh one of the

1160
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,359
important items in this phase would be

1161
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,720
start doing covert physical security

1162
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,640
assessment

1163
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,240
because we all know that when it comes

1164
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,920
to sorry

1165
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,919
when it comes into full scope red team

1166
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,800
assessment physical security is a part

1167
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,560
of it right

1168
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,079
so it's kind of very very uh you know

1169
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,160
interesting area

1170
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,000
so when we when we reach this phase

1171
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,759
because we we have taken care of

1172
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,839
kind of many other aspects of that

1173
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,440
organization when we reach there

1174
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,440
also start doing covered physical

1175
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,000
security assessment so what is covered

1176
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,960
security uh physical security assessment

1177
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,480
for example when you when we think about

1178
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,160
physical security assessment that is all

1179
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,040
about lock picking you know getting into

1180
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,839
an organization

1181
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,800
evading uh counter measures such as in

1182
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,279
our fedex

1183
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,160
scan aids security uh guard stuff like

1184
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,160
that right

1185
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,078
but when it comes into covert physical

1186
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,879
security assessment

1187
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,880
this is all about

1188
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,400
uh i mean we are not doing anything in

1189
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,000
covert mode we are uh going into your

1190
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,560
organization and you know walking

1191
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,040
through

1192
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,960
the doors and we are having uh you know

1193
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,400
we are inspecting the data centers or

1194
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
you know and other physical security

1195
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,960
measures

1196
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,079
to understand i mean we will be walking

1197
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,079
along with that uh

1198
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,240
people from that facility you know we

1199
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,720
are not doing anything in covert mode

1200
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,160
right so uh we can identify the most

1201
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,078
important uh

1202
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,359
data centers manufacturing plants you

1203
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,280
know processing standards

1204
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,400
stuff like that to identify many

1205
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,720
physical uh

1206
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,319
sector related findings for example if

1207
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,759
you are looking at this screenshot

1208
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,920
you can see that this this is from a

1209
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,680
smart tv right it's on kind of a smart

1210
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,760
tv which is using for

1211
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,440
uh performing uh like a video

1212
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,000
conferencing and stuff like that

1213
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,400
if you are placing a dropbox a physical

1214
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,040
dropbox in the back of this tv

1215
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,520
it is i mean it is not it cannot be

1216
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,359
detected so i have used these uh slides

1217
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,200
uh when i presented something in

1218
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,920
this year's nerdcon conference and

1219
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,399
people my question was to identify

1220
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,440
the attack is dropbox which is attached

1221
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,000
in this screenshot

1222
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,560
in this behind this tv and most of the

1223
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,480
people

1224
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,720
they were not able to you know identify

1225
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,720
that

1226
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,319
and then proactive remediation process

1227
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,480
and plans uh you know always

1228
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,839
as a result of the first three phases

1229
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,760
we'll come up with a proactive

1230
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,520
remediation process and plans because

1231
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,400
all these identified issues needs to be

1232
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,400
remediated right

1233
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,440
and the funny thing about our physical

1234
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,280
security assistant

1235
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,720
you don't get to break any doors or

1236
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,319
locks you know

1237
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,000
just do a review to identify these

1238
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,560
vulnerabilities in you know physical

1239
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,160
systems

1240
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,160
you know always keep an eye open

1241
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,240
okay i have eight more minutes so this

1242
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,680
is the final phase

1243
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:38,720
phase five so this is where we will have

1244
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:42,160
we will attain a place that

1245
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,799
uh a mature team operations because

1246
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,598
we did a lot of stuff in the back i mean

1247
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,560
the past

1248
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,440
four steps right uh four phases right so

1249
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,480
this is where

1250
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,480
uh by by when we reach five five

1251
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,800
we'll be having significant improvement

1252
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,960
of organizational security posture

1253
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,960
because we identified many issues we

1254
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,400
shared our findings with blue teams

1255
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,720
uh we shared our findings with

1256
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,200
management and you know they did a lot

1257
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,399
of

1258
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,359
remediation against these findings so by

1259
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,680
this time we'll be

1260
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,359
having highly skilled operators or you

1261
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,480
know who has capabilities to write

1262
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,560
custom code

1263
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,839
custom command and control service and

1264
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,400
stuff like that

1265
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,799
and most importantly we will be having a

1266
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,800
well different property model

1267
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,720
to measure the progress of red and blue

1268
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,359
team capabilities because

1269
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,560
we are not there to just do things right

1270
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,520
so we need to

1271
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,000
have a well different way so that we can

1272
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,720
trout

1273
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,240
track our own progress and convey that

1274
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,919
to the management because

1275
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,160
they are spending money for all these

1276
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,720
activities so that is very much

1277
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,799
important then we can start doing cover

1278
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,359
physical security assessment because uh

1279
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,040
you know

1280
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:51,040
we have cleared most of things in the

1281
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,119
past four phases

1282
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,960
then uh like i mentioned custom tuning

1283
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,000
capabilities and one of the important

1284
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,480
thing would be

1285
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,160
continuous adversary emulation and

1286
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,520
simulation to keep

1287
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,160
different days on the toes because

1288
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,200
every week or every day new attack

1289
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,759
vector is new

1290
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,640
psr comes into the play right so we need

1291
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,640
to uh

1292
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,960
do continuous simulation and elimination

1293
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,118
exercises so that defenders will be you

1294
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,359
know

1295
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,680
will be on their own toes and will be

1296
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:24,000
more efficient

1297
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,440
then continues our team operations with

1298
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,359
well-defined process

1299
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,200
because uh these are things are not

1300
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,799
happening in a day or a couple of months

1301
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,160
it will take you know a significant

1302
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,240
amount of time

1303
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,200
to reach phase five of red team

1304
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,479
operations

1305
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,480
international operations

1306
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,040
going to the next one so this is the

1307
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,040
important part because

1308
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,920
we have strategic plans and tactical

1309
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:51,599
plans so for example we have a

1310
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,400
long time objective we need to identify

1311
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,640
uh you know how what i mean how many

1312
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,400
senior executives are in our company

1313
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,078
and how many of them are vulnerable to

1314
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,280
phishing attacks so that is the long

1315
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,520
term objective

1316
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,040
so we can split that into tactical pants

1317
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,680
like on tactical plants

1318
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,680
uh last for for four to five months

1319
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,560
within four to five months we can

1320
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,839
understand uh the the senior executives

1321
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,319
entire on

1322
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,920
who are all these how many of these

1323
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,880
people are vulnerable to simple phishing

1324
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,599
campaigns

1325
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,440
then uh you know uh perform awareness

1326
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,720
then ask them to enable two-factor

1327
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,800
authentication

1328
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,720
so every strategy plan can be divided

1329
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,440
into tactical plans and put that into

1330
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,919
play

1331
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,839
so there is uh you know i have followed

1332
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,319
this pla this method uh you know

1333
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,440
for a long time and it is kind of uh

1334
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:41,040
very much

1335
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,040
you know it gives result

1336
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,839
also there is one more point the

1337
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,720
management always needs updates about

1338
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,040
everything so

1339
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,040
uh they are asking us to do uh perform

1340
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,040
writing operations and

1341
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,040
they are not supposed to wait for like

1342
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,119
six months without any results right

1343
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,440
so they need periodic updates from our

1344
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,800
ends so the best way to do that having

1345
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,960
technical plans for

1346
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,440
each subcategory from a business

1347
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,440
standpoint

1348
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,599
and about this picture i always i really

1349
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,240
wanted to show

1350
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,079
off this image because uh you know this

1351
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,520
is the perfect symphony between the

1352
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,839
attackers and different days

1353
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,720
adversaries and different things uh we

1354
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,040
created uh

1355
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,000
this uh conceptual team versus routine

1356
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,319
picture

1357
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,480
uh you know uh for a cpa which we had

1358
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,880
organized uh before two years for cocoon

1359
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,440
uh

1360
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,119
cyber security contracts uh this picture

1361
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,359
is uh you know portrait uh

1362
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,560
as native kerala master art form called

00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,000
organizing team they had created this

1367
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,319
image for us i really

1368
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,119
like this i i really like to show off

1369
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,839
this picture

1370
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,720
in kind of uh in almost every

1371
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,759
presentations

1372
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,640
which i give it is really example of

1373
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,560
you know the actual symphony between the

1374
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,879
really cool symphony between red teams

1375
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,720
and blue teams

1376
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,800
they are not enemies because uh for

1377
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,240
example the blue the red guy comes up

1378
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,400
with a new tactic

1379
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,598
the blue uh the blue guy lands it and

1380
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,839
prevents it right

1381
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,680
so the next next time the red guy

1382
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,400
attacks the blue guy he has to come up

1383
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,720
with a new

1384
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,480
attack plan he has to come up with a new

1385
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,799
tools techniques or procedure

1386
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,920
it's kind of you know a game a kind of a

1387
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,040
martial arts

1388
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,440
so that's how i uh like uh

1389
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,558
xbox or you know uh the red team and the

1390
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,839
blue team uh

1391
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:32,960
should be working together and

1392
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:35,520
uh yeah i saved two minutes right

1393
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,000
so now it's a time for q and a i know uh

1394
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,960
this

1395
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,640
has been uh you know i talked a little

1396
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,800
bit faster this time because

1397
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,960
uh you know i wanted to keep the within

1398
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,200
45 minutes

1399
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,040
i'm afraid i would just that uh it's two

1400
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:53,040
minutes until the next speaker is on

1401
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:56,160
so very little time but

1402
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:59,599
