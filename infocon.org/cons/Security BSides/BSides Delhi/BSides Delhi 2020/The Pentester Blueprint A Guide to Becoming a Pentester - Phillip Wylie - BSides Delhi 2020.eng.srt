00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,760
international conference uh and not only

that i see you've got the um

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,199
the regulation information security

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,238
haircut

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,440
um which which means that uh we make the

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,040
perfect pair

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,160
uh on our viewers screens at the moment

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,839
so um philip you're talking about the

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,279
pentester blueprint a guide

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,960
to becoming a pen tester i'm hoping that

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,079
you are also a pen tester

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,840
and and therefore what is it about pen

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,559
testing that makes you want to

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,440
get more people in is it purely you know

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,160
too much work

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,559
or or something else well it's kind of

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,599
uh

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,919
i before i i also teach pen testing

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,360
at a community college and prior to

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,640
doing that i did a lot of mentoring

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,520
helping people that wanted to get in the

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,520
field

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,520
and when i wrote this talk there wasn't

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,640
anything that i was aware of at the time

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,119
i've been given this for

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,479
two years now but there was all sorts of

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,159
books on how to be

37
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,240
you know in pen testing pen testing

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,759
skills but no one was really sharing the

39
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,199
prerequisite knowledge that you needed

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,560
to become a pen tester

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,479
so this was kind of really lacking in

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
the community and

43
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,759
i started this talk and actually have a

44
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,200

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,720

one of the things i really loved about

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,079
one of the good things

73
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,680
of uh social isolation through the

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,760
coronavirus pandemic

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,800

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,640
global content

77
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,480

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,319
share information and one of the things

82
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,159
i really hope going forward

83
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:07,679

or most recent roles in offensive

113
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,719
security was

114
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,079
uh working as a red team lead i was in

115
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,919

advocate and board member

125
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,080
so my uncommon journey to offensive

126
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,560
security

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,840
kind of started out way back out of high

128
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,960
school i didn't know what i wanted to do

129
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,359
for a living

130
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,120
so my friends told me i should be a

131
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
professional wrestler so i wrestled

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,400
professionally for a while and during

133
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,759
that time i actually wrestled

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,880
a bear and you know i got married

135
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,080
in 88 and i needed to get a more stable

136
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,440
career

137
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,000
i stuck with the wrestling thing for

138
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,080
like another another year

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,800
and then i worked various jobs retail

140
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,240
sales construction different types of

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,039
manual labor

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,880
but none of that really paid well and

143
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,719
was anything i was interested in

144
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,639
so i went to a trade school to learn

145
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,080
autocad drafting and became an autocad

146
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,000
draftsman

147
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,680
i did that for a few years and during

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,680
that time

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
you know prior to being a drafter i

150
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,759
really have exposure to computers

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,360
so i learned how to use computers and a

152
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,680
lot of the places i worked at

153
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,199
as a draftsman we didn't have it staff

154
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,639
so i figured out how to fix things and

155
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,919
found out that i had more of a natural

156
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,120
ability

157
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,639
for the iet side of things so i taught

158
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
myself how to build computers took a

159
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,680
novell

160
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,919
netware network operating system course

161
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,440
and became a sysadmin

162
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,440
so i did that for a little over six

163
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,680
years and i moved into infosec

164
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,800
started out as a network security

165
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,039
analyst

166
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
and then after a while we we hired in

167
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,719
our company hired in a cso

168
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,479
and he came in and kind of divided our

169
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,000
group up into different sections

170
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,560
everyone on the team was doing network

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
security and risk assessments so

172
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,440
everything did everyone did the same

173
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,639
thing but when this new cso came in

174
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,120
he divided us up into different

175
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,840
specializations unfortunately i got put

176
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,360
in appsec

177
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,719
and appsec is where i learned about pen

178
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,319
testing so i got laid off in 2012 and i

179
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,840
went to work consulting as a penetration

180
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,440
tester

181
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,599
so i shared this journey to just kind of

182
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,280
get you know the pro wrestling part is

183
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,120
really not relevant to

184
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,400
becoming a pen tester or the the

185
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,479
drafting piece

186
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,400
but i the stuff to keep in mind here is

187
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,240
the sysadmin experience

188
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
the network security experience the app

189
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,360
set those things

190
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
played a big role in me becoming a pen

191
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,440
tester

192
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,599
so i share this this slide each semester

193
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,840
with my students because this

194
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,039
event actually came out for my lectures

195
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,239
for the first day of class

196
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,960
each semester i would uh you know do a

197
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,520
first day

198
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,880
introduction to pen testing to tell my

199
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,198
students about pen testing

200
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,719
and it's eventually turned into a

201
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,160
conference presentation

202
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
which i gave for the first time in

203
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,319
b-sides dfw

204
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,080
which is the the local b-sides

205
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,840
conference to my area which is the

206
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,520
dallas-fort worth area

207
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,599
and so i share this slide each semester

208
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,039
my students because i love this quote

209
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,159
that i first learned from spider-man

210
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,520
with great power comes great

211
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
responsibility

212
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,039
so only hack or perform pen test if you

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,800
have permission

214
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,800
even better written permission hacking

215
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,400
without permission is illegal

216
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,720
and so up at the top you see this little

217
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,440
sticker up there hacking is not a crime

218
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,800
uh i'm a advocate for hacking is not a

219
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,919
crime and a board member

220
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,319
and what we're trying to do is to

221
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,000
let people know that hacking is not a

222
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,479
criminal activity unless you're using it

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,680
as such

224
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,520
just like locksmiths uh

225
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,879
unlocking your door that's not illegal

226
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,758
unless they don't have permission

227
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,319
or they're trying to get in for

228
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,400
nefarious reasons so we're trying to get

229
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,160
the message out hacking is important

230
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,758
your security researchers are finding

231
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,720
vulnerabilities that

232
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,639
allow people to create remediations for

233
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,440
and fixes so

234
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,879
it prevents uh you know we're just

235
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,120
trying to take back the name

236
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,440
that it's not just a negative that is

237
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,199
it's a positive thing

238
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,039
and what is pen testing pen testing is

239
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,000
assessing security from an adversarial

240
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,318
perspective

241
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,639
attempting to exploit vulnerabilities to

242
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,680
gain unauthorized access to systems and

243
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,360
sensitive data

244
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,879
also not as hacking security posture

245
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,000
from an adversarial perspective gives

246
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,800
you a better understanding of the

247
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,240
security

248
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,760
risk severity exploitable

249
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,680
vulnerabilities are higher risk and

250
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,519
higher priority for remediation as well

251
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,039
as justification for budging

252
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,919
sometimes remediation can be very

253
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,839
expensive and if you prove that that

254
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,600
vulnerability is exploitable then

255
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,680
there's more of a need to

256
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,680
remediate that finding so that's a lot

257
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,040
easier for companies to justify

258
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,120
the cost of remediation

259
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,319
my pen testing regulatory compliance is

260
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,240
a big reason

261
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,519
for pen testing when i got started in

262
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,279
2012

263
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,200
most pen testers were consultants or

264
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,880
contractors as

265
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,360
payment card industry data security

266
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,519
standard became regulatory compliance

267
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,480
requirement for companies processing

268
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,040
credit cards

269
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,600
then the need for pen testing became

270
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,880
more

271
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,000
more well known and became a more of a

272
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,360
priority

273
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,120
a lot of companies were still using

274
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,320
consultants at that time but

275
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,880
as uh the need for testing

276
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,720
you know was was proven then companies

277
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,519
started hiring their own internal

278
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,600
pen testers and so pen testing it's a

279
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,000
fun job every time i hack into a system

280
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
it's still

281
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
just as much fun as it was the first

282
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,399
time and although it's not really a new

283
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,440
role

284
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,320
it's relatively new as an overall

285
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,320
concept in

286
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,760
security programs so there's a lot of

287
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,680
good opportunities out there in this

288
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,120
area

289
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,560
testing jobs so pen testing is the the

290
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,959
the short term of penetration tester

291
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,079
and these roles can fall and normally be

292
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,760
categorized as

293
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,000
security consultants analysts or

294
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,399
engineers because not all hr departments

295
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,680
can give a single title to every job

296
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,240
within a company they

297
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,920
to make things easier to to manage you

298
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,360
know your security personnel whether

299
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,760
they're defenders

300
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,399
uh pen testers sock analysts a lot of

301
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,319
times have

302
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,000
similar titles the job descriptions are

303
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,680
what varies so when you're looking for a

304
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,560
job you want to look through

305
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,439
the job descriptions and so some

306
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,760
different terms

307
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
synonymous for pen testing is ethical

308
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,680
hackers this is the one that's most

309
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
common

310
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,560
think of the ethical hacking

311
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,199
certification the certified ethical

312
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,279
hacker

313
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,120
it was one of the first certifications

314
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,720
of his kind but to make it easier to

315
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,120
understand they use the term ethical

316
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,800
hacker so this makes a lot easier for

317
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,800
non-technical people to understand what

318
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,000
you're talking about and even some

319
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,599
technical people offensive security

320
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,320
adversarial security are some of the

321
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,760
newer more new newer terms that you hear

322
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,920
pin testing refer to

323
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,200
as and threaten vulnerability management

324
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,800
is a a

325
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,160
department that sometimes pin testing

326
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,359
falls under threat vulnerability

327
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,760
management

328
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,519
is typically your vulnerability scanning

329
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,560
and your remediation

330
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,880
part of a of a program

331
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,000
and so sometimes pin test groups fall in

332
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,240
that same group

333
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,240
pin testing skills in other areas so not

334
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,240
only are these skills important for

335
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
pen testers it's helpful for sock

336
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,720
analyst and network analysts and

337
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,040
engineers

338
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,000
being able to identify malicious traffic

339
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,880
makes them

340
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,440
better at their job makes them you know

341
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,120
help the defense of the company

342
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,440
so your your digital forensics and

343
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,320
instant response be able to investigate

344
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,240
a incident and understand the attacks

345
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,600
makes it easier for your investigation

346
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,640
if you're not familiar with those

347
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,079
different type of attacks it's going to

348
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,480
take a little more to investigate

349
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,760
so understanding pin testing is helpful

350
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,360
in those areas

351
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,959
purple teams this is kind of a newer

352
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,680
concept this is where the defense and

353
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,359
offense

354
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,479
security works together to improve the

355
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,959
defenses so instead of just performing

356
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,920
a pen test you're able to go in and work

357
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,920
with these teams to

358
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,839
execute scripts to see if scripts can be

359
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,279
executed on the endpoint

360
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,040
seeing if it's being detected and

361
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,760
working together as a team

362
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,120
with the defensive team to be able to

363
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,600
block and detect these

364
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,480
these type of activities in application

365
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,399
security

366
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,680
be able to test the security of the

367
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,160
application through the

368
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,000
software development life cycle makes it

369
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,439
easier to remediate these bindings if

370
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,959
you find something earlier on

371
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,920
it's easier to fix than you've been

372
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,079
through several iterations of updates

373
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,920
on your code so this is an important

374
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,920
area in action this is kind of where

375
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,040
i found out about pen testing myself was

376
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,719
working on

377
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,000
appsec team types of targets that you're

378
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,440
going to test

379
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,560
so there's different type of targets

380
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,279
that you're going to test as a pen

381
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,239
tester

382
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,839
so network you want to test internally

383
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,160
externally from the internet

384
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,920
and wireless you know attacker can have

385
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,360
a high-powered antenna

386
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,240
and usb uh network adapter

387
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,920
and you know attack your facility a mile

388
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,519
down the road or so

389
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,439
so you really need to make sure that

390
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,000
that's the the external facing as well

391
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,160
as internal

392
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,360
is tested application this is a

393
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,880
popularity a lot of

394
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,800
companies are using web-based

395
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,680
applications they can be accessed

396
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,599
anywhere

397
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,120
if allowed they can be accessed outside

398
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,839
the company thick client your

399
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,040
traditional binary executable type files

400
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,240
mobile and cloud

401
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,959
as well as api and iot apis are used a

402
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,040
lot but

403
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,880
due to like iot and that sort of thing

404
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,760
but this is a really important area to

405
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,200
test

406
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,959
web applications have really become

407
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,040
popular because at one time

408
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,880
we wrote thick client applications to

409
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,920
work on different operating systems and

410
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,040
one time you know it's mainly just

411
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,880
windows but with

412
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,800
you know linux in your environment mac

413
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,959
os environment mobile devices

414
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,040
then web application made it easier to

415
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,839
to deliver an application across

416
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
multiple platforms

417
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,480
in hardware hardware is a popular area

418
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,719
that needs to be tested

419
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,079
your network hardware your companies

420
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,199
that build routers and switches are

421
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,319
going to test their

422
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,319
their products to make sure they're

423
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,680
secure and your medical devices need to

424
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,800
be tested as well

425
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,279
i've performed wi-fi pen tests for

426
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,000
hospitals during my consulting career

427
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,160
and you know

428
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,160
it's kind of scary when you see these

429
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,360
medical devices connected to a wi-fi

430
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,439
network

431
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,560
so a malicious actor got access to that

432
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,880
network

433
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,399
they could compromise us those devices

434
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,079
as well as some of these

435
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,440
devices like pacemakers and insulin

436
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,120
pumps are

437
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,480
are connected by bluetooth so you can

438
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,680
manage the systems and

439
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,519
monitor those devices so these need to

440
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,719
be tested they can be weaponized for bad

441
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,720
so we want to make sure

442
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,079
that those devices are secure

443
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,639
transportation

444
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,719
any type of transportation different

445
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,880
types of vehicles cars buses

446
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,079
trains airplanes we need to make sure

447
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,000
those are secure

448
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,079
especially with the autonomous driving

449
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,519
self-driving vehicles coming out

450
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,880
we need to make sure that they're secure

451
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,320
that they can't be used to weaponize

452
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,000
someone takes control of that they could

453
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,079
cause harm so that's

454
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,160
one area that has become popular a lot

455
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,839
of different

456
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,279
people in different companies automotive

457
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,440
industry have

458
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,760
you know added pen testers to their team

459
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,240
to make sure that they're

460
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,519
that their products are secure you need

461
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,440
that need to make sure that your people

462
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,800
and your buildings are secure to you

463
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,560
because you can have the best security

464
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,680
in the world but if someone let someone

465
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,000
in the building

466
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,839
and they get in the server room or get

467
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,639
access to a computer they're

468
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,600
more than likely to be able to exploit

469
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,560
that system

470
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,279
if not the whole network and same thing

471
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,839
with your building

472
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,959
your building security and your in your

473
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,000
physical security

474
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,000
all needs to be secure

475
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,599
so types of knowledge so when you're

476
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,079
performing a pen test these are kind of

477
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,240
the three

478
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,239
main categories black box sometimes

479
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,240
referred to as blind pen test

480
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,680
white box also known as crystal box and

481
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,320
gray box

482
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,920
black box or blind pen test is going to

483
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,440
be more limited to

484
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,719
the ip addresses or a url or some cases

485
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,199
you know i've done a full scope pen test

486
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,519
or

487
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,758
red team engagements where i only knew

488
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,759
the physical address of the company

489
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,600
so we could test the physical security

490
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,519
and it was up to me to find all the ip

491
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,680
addresses that the company owned

492
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,519
through open source intelligence and

493
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,599
using tools like shodan

494
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,720
to be able to test the external facing

495
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,160
targets like their

496
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,759
their networks and applications

497
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,360
so this takes a little more time because

498
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,720
you're having to research and find this

499
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,399
information

500
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,839
now if you go to like a white box test

501
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,040
this is where you got detailed system

502
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,600
information

503
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,959
including applica accounts for

504
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,279
application tests

505
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,800
uh even like source code you know you

506
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,920
need to make sure that the source code

507
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,758
is secure

508
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,599
so between these two you know the white

509
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,360
box is more thoroughly testing

510
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,120
whereas black box emulates more of an

511
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,720
attacker

512
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,639
these are all based on time too if you

513
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,399
have a lot of time then you can perform

514
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,120
a black box test if you're more limited

515
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,399
on time

516
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,399
then you'll want to go with a white box

517
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,920
test that way nothing gets missed

518
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,160
you know you may be able to maybe your

519
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,160
authentication is really strong and it's

520
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,079
hard to initially hack into the system

521
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,759
but once you have access what's possible

522
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,198
we need to test that

523
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,280
administrators don't need to be able to

524
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,760
see account information and pii

525
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,720
as well as lower level users don't need

526
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,959
to be able to do

527
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,480
admin functions so we need to make sure

528
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,600
that there's some segregation of duties

529
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,919
there

530
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,438
so we need to test on all levels in a

531
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,360
gray box test this is kind of a

532
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,600
combination of the two

533
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,359
and this is what you see most the time

534
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,639
as a as a pen tester

535
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,080
you know you you're going to get more

536
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,039
detail ips because they really don't

537
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,879
want you to miss

538
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,520
anything so they're going to give you

539
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,559
you know either ip ranges subnets or

540
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,799
individual

541
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,520
ips to test so this is typically what

542
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,520
you're going to see

543
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,679
in types of pen testing depth or

544
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,000
different steps in a pen test

545
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,280
vulnerability scanning and vulnerability

546
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,880
assessments you'll see

547
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,039
noted here not a penta so these are not

548
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,440
a pen test there are some companies that

549
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,919
will

550
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,880
run a vulnerability scan put it in a pen

551
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,720
test report

552
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,120
and give it to a customer either so

553
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,880
either they don't understand pin testing

554
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,320
or they're depending on the person

555
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,120
they're doing the test for doesn't

556
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,639
understand

557
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,159
pen testing and they're kind of taking

558
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,600
advantage of them

559
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,520
vulnerability scanning is an important

560
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,199
part it should be part of your

561
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,559
vulnerability management program

562
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,440
you should be scanning on a regular

563
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,960
basis and working with the it groups to

564
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,799
remediate those

565
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,919
and then your vulnerability assessment

566
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,120
this is where you're basically doing

567
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,080
vulnerability scan

568
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,080
plus you're validating the

569
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,000
vulnerabilities your vulnerability

570
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,120
scanning can find false positives so you

571
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,160
know make sure they're not false

572
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,918
positives

573
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,600
and in this stage you go a step further

574
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,039
you're also running other tools to look

575
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,039
for vulnerabilities

576
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,280
that may not be detected by the

577
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,799
vulnerability scanner

578
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,799
so these are important steps to do

579
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,280
during a pen test and then once

580
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,320
you have validated your vulnerabilities

581
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,240
and it found anything

582
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,000
else with your manual testing and other

583
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,320
tools that you use during

584
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,240
the vulnerability assessment then now

585
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,520
you're going to exploit or hack those

586
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,840
vulnerabilities that you found

587
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,200
so we need to know how severe they are

588
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,360
how much further you can get

589
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,120
so you know some vulnerability may not

590
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,080
look that

591
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,199
risky from first glance but once you get

592
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,600
a system what's

593
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,840
what's available there what level of

594
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,240
user are you able to access that system

595
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,199
if you're able to access this nt system

596
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,919
authority

597
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
uh root domain admin then you can do a

598
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,760
lot more things so

599
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,520
this is a way to to further test your

600
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,480
security passed like a vulnerability

601
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,000
scan

602
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,039
and then you have your red team in

603
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,039
adversarial testing

604
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,160
red teaming a good quote

605
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,919
from a good friend of mine and founder

606
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,799
dallas hackers association

607
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,240
he describes penta red teaming as

608
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,000
testing the blue team

609
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,080
so not only are you testing the security

610
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,039
and the technology for vulnerabilities

611
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,199
you're also

612
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,879
testing the humans you're testing the

613
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,760
different endpoint protection making

614
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,799
sure

615
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,160
that it's able to detect the different

616
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,080
malicious activities

617
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,600
and this is less restrictive scope

618
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,399
sometimes referred to

619
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,799
as an open scope pen test and a lot of

620
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,440
times people confuse red team

621
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,799
with pin testing in general it's you

622
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,320
know a different type of pen test so

623
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,320
it's not exactly the same thing

624
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,720
so specializations which this first one

625
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,400
really nodded a specialization this is

626
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,520
just typically where someone starts out

627
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,679
as a pen tester

628
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,280
is what most pen testers do as a

629
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,440
generalist you're testing network

630
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,120
wi-fi networks in some light web

631
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,679
application

632
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,199
these generals are not typically experts

633
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,960
in web app pin testing but you need to

634
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,919
know a little bit of web app pen testing

635
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,080
because a lot of administrators tools to

636
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,400
administer like print servers

637
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,120
different it functions use like a web

638
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,200
front end

639
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,719
so as a pen test you may get in maybe

640
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,679
the end point protection is good they've

641
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,120
got all their patches

642
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,159
in place everything's configured

643
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,479
securely sometimes the web layer is the

644
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,919
the only way to get in so you need to

645
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,760
understand some light web app pin

646
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,520
testing

647
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,039
then the next specialization is your

648
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,559
your application your web app

649
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,000
mobile cloud api and fit clients

650
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,678
this is an important area and a lot of

651
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
people come over from here as developers

652
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,720
maybe you work as a developer you're

653
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,440
interested in pen testing

654
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,600
then you understand that that technology

655
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,919
so it's easier for you to

656
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,840
you know secure or break into that

657
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,360
that technology so there's social

658
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,559
engineering physical

659
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,240
uh building assessments security

660
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,678
assessments so these kind of go hand in

661
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,480
hand these two the social engineering

662
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,919
physical

663
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,080
are usually part of the same type of

664
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,880
assessments then transportation as we

665
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,639
mentioned

666
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,159
earlier and red teams

667
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,320
so how do i become a pentester this is

668
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,760
where this this talk has really become

669
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,918
popular people

670
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,039
you know hear pen testing they see it it

671
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,159
looks like something interesting

672
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,559
something like to do but where do they

673
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,840
start

674
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,000
you know you there's a lot of books out

675
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,600
there that show you

676
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,360
how to perform pen tests the different

677
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,039
tools but

678
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,559
nothing really guides you tells you okay

679
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,840
this is what you need before you become

680
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,440
a pen tester

681
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,639
so that was the whole goal of this talk

682
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,880
so you need the technology knowledge

683
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,640
so you need to understand networking

684
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,799
operating systems especially windows and

685
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,960
linux from like a sys admin level

686
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,158
understand security and depending on

687
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,039
what you're going to do application wise

688
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,840
understanding

689
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,799
uh hardware and applications can be very

690
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,399
important

691
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,200
so you really need to understand the

692
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,880
security before you can secure it and

693
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,000
before you can break into it so

694
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,600
understanding how to build a server if

695
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,200
you install apache web server then

696
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,439
you're gonna have more of an idea

697
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,039
of what it needs to be to secure it and

698
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,600
then you need to go know what to exploit

699
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,360
by be able to set that up

700
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,240
so hacking knowledge this is where i was

701
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,039
at when i got my first pen testing job

702
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,400
i had used vulnerability scanners and

703
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,760
but i didn't know how to hack so i had

704
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,200
to take a hacking class so i took the

705
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,039
oscp

706
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,640
and so the oscp is where i learned how

707
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,240
to hack so you can get this hacking

708
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,840
knowledge from classes

709
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,840
conferences such as your b-sides

710
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,439
conferences different meetings and

711
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,000
meet-ups your different user groups

712
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,600
there's

713
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,440
groups that are you know focused on

714
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,000
security and some of them

715
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,760
cover offensive security topics and then

716
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,039
self-study no matter where

717
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,600
if you're going to school if you're

718
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,960
taking college courses or you know doing

719
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,409
all the self-taught

720
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,640
you do need some level of self-study to

721
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,799
[Music]

722
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,840
enhance your learning abilities so home

723
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,400
labs videos there's a lot of good

724
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,760
videos on youtube some decent udemy

725
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,080
courses out there are some very good

726
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,000
udemy courses tutorials blogs and

727
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,158
articles and twitter

728
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
more specifically referred to as infosec

729
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,080
twitter is a good way to find people in

730
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,360
the industry that are writing tools that

731
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,879
are professionals that you can learn

732
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,959
from and find out about

733
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,960
their talks at conferences and workshops

734
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,720
so the hacker mindset so once you even

735
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,159
knowing how to hack you've got to

736
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,679
develop this mindset

737
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,919
and this is kind of similar to learning

738
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,000
how to troubleshoot something when you

739
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,320
install like windows server for the

740
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,880
first time and you have no problems with

741
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,158
it

742
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,760
then it's easy to install but if

743
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,600
something goes wrong then it's hard to

744
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,080
troubleshoot until you've run into

745
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,678
some issues and successfully resolve

746
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,840
those issues then you really don't

747
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,919
truly understand that operating system

748
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,840
so the hacker mindset's kind of similar

749
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,600
you know you learn that for instance

750
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,918
apache tomcat if you have a

751
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,639
unrestricted upload or you got default

752
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,799
credentials

753
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,480
you can upload a malicious file the

754
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,918
malicious file can give you a shell to

755
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
that system once you have

756
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:27,039
shell access then you know that you need

757
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,159
to try to get a better more stable

758
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,879
connection to that server uh you know if

759
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,520
that

760
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,880
service account's running as root or nt

761
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,559
system authority then you can do a lot

762
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,480
more things so you kind of learn

763
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,960
through practice you know through ctfs

764
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,600
home labs and bug bounties what to do

765
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,840
next step

766
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,360
you chain those activities together to

767
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,720
learn how to breach a system how to

768
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,918
exploit the system

769
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,760
and gain access to it so this mindset

770
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,360
takes time and repetition to develop and

771
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,240
is best developed with hands-on hacking

772
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,678
experience

773
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,600
so just like anything else you can take

774
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,960
a class and if it doesn't have any

775
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,360
hands-on

776
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,640
uh portions to it then when you get out

777
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,000
there in the real world you're working

778
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,760
with it's gonna be a little difficult so

779
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,039
you have to get the hands-on

780
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,039
lab piece to the learning

781
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,080
so the pen tester blueprint formula is

782
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,679
the technology knowledge plus security

783
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,480
knowledge plus the hacker mindset

784
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,200
so we kind of described what you need to

785
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,960
know but where do you start

786
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,919
so you need to develop a plan so what

787
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,000
you're going to do is you're going to do

788
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,200
a gap analysis based on the skills you

789
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,960
have

790
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,559
and the skills you need so if you have

791
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,440
no i.t experience

792
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,360
then you're going to start with the

793
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,400
basics like operating systems hardware

794
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,399
and networking

795
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,520
if you have it experience you know you

796
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,799
could be on the help desk maybe you

797
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,639
don't work with linux

798
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,720
linux is a good place to start learning

799
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,559
security and networking

800
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,679
if you're in security then kind of learn

801
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,559
the areas that you haven't worked in

802
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,919
maybe you're

803
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,678
a network security analyst you're going

804
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,720
to understand the networking you've got

805
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,080
to learn how to hack

806
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,799
so doing uh learning taking you know pic

807
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,279
pac uh hacking and pen testing courses

808
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,279
participating in ctfs and bug bounties

809
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,919
those are great ways to learn and also

810
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,919
build a lab

811
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,960
so here's kind of three high level

812
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,559
descriptions of some lab options

813
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,080
my favorite is the minimalist lab and

814
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,600
this is like your

815
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,760
the computer you use for your everyday

816
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,879
maybe you have a laptop laptops is what

817
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,039
i prefer because

818
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,320
it's portable if you're home studying

819
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,960
you get bored you can move to other

820
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,840
areas

821
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
of your home you could go to a coffee

822
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,879
shop or

823
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,039
you know just or if you're traveling for

824
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,559
work or you're going to see

825
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,919
friends or in-laws or something you can

826
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,960
carry this with you and you can get some

827
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,720
studying in

828
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,080
so the portability is really what i like

829
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,400
of the minimalist lab

830
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,120
so you have no restrictions on where

831
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,240
you're at

832
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,199
you know and with the minimalist lab

833
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,240
where you have your

834
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,360
your vulnerable vms and your attack vm

835
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,640
that you know you don't even have to

836
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,080
have internet connection once you have

837
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,039
this set up so if you

838
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,120
you're somewhere where there's no

839
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,559
internet then no problem

840
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,479
and then a dedicated lab this is having

841
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,799
like a dedicated system with all your

842
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,080
vulnerable vms on there

843
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:09,120
and uh so that way you know you can

844
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,320
take your your laptop or whatever and

845
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,479
attack those systems so you're going

846
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,439
across the network so it more emulates

847
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,480
a network-based attack so this is

848
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,520
actually what i have i have the

849
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,159
minimalist and

850
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,879
a dedicated lab i have a server that i

851
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,640
built

852
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,039
just specifically for running vulnerable

853
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,039
vms

854
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,520
and so uh attack platforms so you need

855
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,080
something to hack with and i'm sure most

856
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,679
everyone

857
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,360
on here has heard of kali linux so this

858
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,200
is like one of the first

859
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,120
uh pin testing distributions out there

860
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,000
while very good perot os is another

861
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,320
option

862
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,159
a really you know really good solid

863
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,600
option to

864
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,120
alternative to kali linux i got to use

865
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,120
paired os over the summer because i was

866
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,600
performing some wi-fi pen test

867
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,879
for my past employer and i was having

868
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,799
some problems getting some tools

869
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,840
installed on kali linux triperidos and

870
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,320
it worked great

871
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,918
so i'm really a big fan of paired os now

872
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,480
and then ubuntu you can take ubuntu

873
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,320
linux

874
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,960
and install the pentester framework

875
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,480
which is a utility or python script

876
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,320
written by trustedsec

877
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,679
that installs all the pen testing tools

878
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,639
so you have a little more

879
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,960
control over what you're installing and

880
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,480
uh

881
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,799
that way if you like ubuntu linux then

882
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,840
it's more familiar environment to work

883
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,840
in

884
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,120
and then windows you need a system if

885
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,320
you're a pentester you need a windows

886
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,199
system and a linux system because

887
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,320
there's a lot of great

888
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,840
administrative tools for you know doing

889
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,320
network administration

890
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,879
active directory and these are these are

891
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,439
native to

892
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,520
to windows so these are very helpful you

893
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,760
can use the command ovm scripts

894
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,360
by fireeye and that's a set of scripts

895
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,000
that installs all the hacking tools on

896
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,479
there for your

897
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,919
for your pen test so you need you need

898
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,360
your linux platform and a windows

899
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,320
platform you need to be used to using

900
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,918
both of those

901
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,360
for the longest time everyone use was

902
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,159
using mainly linux but

903
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,799
as active directory became a target then

904
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,440
more people

905
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,960
started using linux windows as an attack

906
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,559
platform

907
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,000
so your home lab so you need some

908
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,360
vulnerable vms

909
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,919
so you can download targets from

910
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,479
volunhub.com let us pointable

911
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,159
two and three are great resources for

912
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,360
vulnerable vms they have a lot of

913
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,640
vulnerabilities they were created by

914
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,840
rapid seven

915
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,760
for people to learn how to use

916
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,320
metasploit and it gives you targets to

917
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,760
test

918
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,960
uh metasploit against oas web goat as

919
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,799
well as juice shop and some other

920
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,799
vulnerable vms are great for

921
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,480
web app pen testing and then create your

922
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,879
own vm targets with vulnerable software

923
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,039
from exploitdb

924
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,240
exploitdb is a website that is a

925
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,640
repository

926
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,399
of exploits and not only does it have

927
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,000
exploits it has links to the vulnerable

928
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,719
versions of the software so if you want

929
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,360
to test

930
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,080
a certain exploit out on that vulnerable

931
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,600
software

932
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,960
then you can go download the software

933
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,760
and build that in your lab and test it

934
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,679
out

935
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,480
and another good reason to have a lab

936
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,720
even is you're an experienced pen tester

937
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,159
sometimes it's good to test exploits in

938
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,399
your lab before you go to a

939
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,600
production environment if you're not

940
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,799
careful you can break something in

941
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,279
production environment

942
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,279
and sometimes you know you get one shot

943
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,720
to run these exploits and once it's run

944
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,399
if it doesn't work then that system's

945
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,919
got to be rebooted

946
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,600
to be able to run that exploit so

947
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,159
testing it ahead of time is a great

948
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,000
option and be able to get the exploits

949
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,520
and vulnerable software from exploit db

950
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,600
is a great way to test it so recommended

951
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,360
reading so this first book

952
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,639
penetration testing a hands-on

953
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,039
introduction to hacking

954
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,240
by georgia weedman this was the textbook

955
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,960
i used for my

956
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,399
first year teaching we went to pentest

957
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,679
plus after that because pentest plus

958
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,279
came out

959
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,000
in 2018 and i want to give my students a

960
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,399
certification

961
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,320
to prepare for so we switched to the

962
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,080
comptia pentest plus material

963
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,840
but i still recommend this book because

964
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,799
it takes you through building your own

965
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,039
home lab

966
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,720
and teaches you how to do pen testing

967
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,720
georgia is actually oscp

968
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,399
so i remember when this book came out or

969
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,120
i had my oscp and i actually got the

970
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,158
book

971
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,439
from the publisher to to review and i

972
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,039
just thought once i read that book it's

973
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,399
like man if this only been out when i

974
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,879
was getting my oscp it would have made

975
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,279
things

976
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,120
a lot easier then the hackers playbook

977
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,200
took him two and three

978
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,600
uh this is what i would follow up after

979
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,240
penetration testing

980
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,600
so this gets into some really good real

981
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,840
world scenarios

982
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,799
and skills to build for a pen tester

983
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,879
version three

984
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,879
is the red team edition so i wouldn't

985
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,080
skip out on version two

986
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,799
you know if you're interested in red

987
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,639
team stuff read version three after you

988
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,399
complete version two and the web

989
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,200
application hackers handbook discovering

990
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,080
exploit

991
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,000
security flaws this is created by one of

992
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,120
the creators of burp suite and it's a

993
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,600
great resource

994
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,199
for learning web application pen testing

995
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,959
then i have a couple resources over here

996
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,799
on the right hand side of the screen

997
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,880
the red team field manual and operator

998
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,960
handbook these have different

999
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,640
command line syntax for linux windows

1000
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,399
with the operator handbook they get into

1001
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,159
some cloud technologies they both cover

1002
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,559
some hacking tools

1003
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,880
the red team field manual came out in

1004
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:01,678
2013 but the operator handbook came out

1005
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,200
spring of this year or actually uh like

1006
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,840
around january of this year

1007
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,559
they have a printed book and an ebook

1008
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,080
which i like

1009
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,879
the portability ebooks i actually have

1010
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,240
both of those but it's uh it covers like

1011
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,799
some kubernetes stuff

1012
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,679
and docker so a lot of different cloud

1013
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,039
technologies

1014
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,519
so that's a really great reference to

1015
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,840
have good for red teamers blue teamers

1016
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:26,000
oset so learning resources

1017
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,678
so i've got a list of resources here the

1018
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,480
top section here there's a little space

1019
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,440

you that's some

1186
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,040
excellent advice and insider information

1187
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,839
on getting into the pentester game

1188
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,520
we don't have any questions on the

1189
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,000
youtube link although

1190
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,839
uh it looks like somebody has already

1191
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,560
pre-ordered a copy of your book

1192
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:04,640
on our say-so so if we go halves on the

1193
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:08,160
profit that'll be absolutely

1194
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,440
um uh that was really good i think one

1195
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,759
of the points that you made

1196
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,359
quite early on was the the ability or

1197
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,000
you certainly hinted at the ability of a

1198
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,920
good pen tester to work with other teams

1199
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,280
and i think that's that's so very true

1200
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,359
because we often

1201
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,040
the uh traditional view of a pen tester

1202
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,839
is somebody who's just sort of by

1203
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,880
themselves

1204
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,359
focused single screen single person when

1205
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,560
actually

1206
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,000
it's a huge team effort um i think the

1207
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,400
previous um

1208
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,079
uh the previous speaker daniel spoke

1209
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,280
about the a team and how everybody

1210
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,400
brought a different

1211
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:44,079
skill to the game uh and

1212
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,520
that couldn't be truer for pen testing

1213
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,520
yeah and and that you mentioned that

1214
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,359
that's been one of the

1215
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,359
successes of your bug bounties your

1216
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,799
crowd source pen test because you've got

1217
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,400
you know you may have one application

1218
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,760
where traditional pen testing

1219
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,520
you've got one person working on it but

1220
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,920
if you've got like 100 different people

1221
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,920
or

1222
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,440
20 different people pen testing they've

1223
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,720
all got their specialties

1224
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,720
there's things that they'll find and

1225
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,919
they can help teach each other in the

1226
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,118
process as well

1227
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,160
