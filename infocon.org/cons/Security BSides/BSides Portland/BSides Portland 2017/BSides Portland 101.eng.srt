1
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,490
hello hello welcome to welcome to

2
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,770
besides there would be an introduction

3
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,720
to the speaker but we screwed around and

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,130
ate up that time so we're gonna

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,000
introduce ourselves

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:32,019
I'm Michael Lewis I'm Ricky oh this is

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,610
Topher and then Joe is mint mentioned

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:39,760
there but didn't appear that's fine

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:45,190
we'll just continue without so firstly

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:48,190
we we have badges oh my god they

11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,129
work that's amazing I really didn't

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:54,449
think that was gonna happen you can

13
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:58,899
direct most of your complaints to me so

14
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:00,789
what is on on the badge so this is a on

15
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:02,100
the back if for those of you who have a

16
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:08,050
badge and they're playing along at home

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:10,690
on the back is a NRF 52 a 32 module it's

18
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,360
arigato BMD 300 these are really neat

19
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:17,710
these are really neat tiny little ble

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:22,890
modules that they have a cortex aren't

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,889
armed for their cortex m4 inside and

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,970
they're really low-power really neat and

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,520
they're so small that you can actually

24
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:36,690
embed them inside of an RSA SecurID

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:39,850
token there's a that's a different talk

26
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:45,400
there's a neat little LED screen d-pads

27
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:49,330
that most we probably work you know they

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,130
all flash but QA we didn't get the

29
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,350
chance to actually to do QA so the

30
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,970
buttons may be work and you can like

31
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,550
flip them through into a little see if

32
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,050
my button works maybe you can flip them

33
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,380
through into a cute little like

34
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:06,039
sasquatch hunts cameras games it's got

35
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:08,288
two two oxen or an oxen docking

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,349
connector and a wagon hitch and a power

37
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:12,970
switch that is a little bit flaky so if

38
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:15,429
you flick it on and flick it off and

39
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,620
it's still on move your battery around a

40
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,010
little bit or accept the fact that it's

41
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,010
always on

42
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:29,340
so how did this happen so if you went to

43
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,900
Vegas and you were part of the DC 503

44
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,900
party then this is sort of familiar to

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,319
you this looks very similar to the bet

46
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,080
that Joe primarily designed for the 503

47
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,940
Trail which was amazing

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,880
and we had this great idea that we were

49
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,079
going to just recycle that design and

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:52,650
then this wouldn't be such an epic

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,750
clusterfuck like it always is and then

52
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,790
we kind of had our Vegas hangover then

53
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,760
we said well you know wouldn't it be

54
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,650
great if we had these like actually

55
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,049
produced because it's really hard to

56
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,150
solder these by hand and we knew that we

57
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,069
were gonna have a lot of people so we

58
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,170
really need to make this you know to do

59
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:13,950
design for manufacturer right to design

60
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,839
this to be producible by machine so the

61
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,040
DC 5 or 3-bedroom made a hundred of them

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,850
and we had the really tiny parts

63
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,820
professionally assembled and then the

64
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,320
other parts we drank a lot of

65
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,790
caffeinated beverages and hung out of

66
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,750
control H and just soldered them until

67
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,690
we couldn't see straight and we knew

68
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:36,959
that we have way too many we have way

69
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,430
too many people to do that and that we

70
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,720
really would benefit from having

71
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,600
professional assembly so that took a

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,359
little longer than I thought it would

73
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:51,620
and then there was a there was a lot of

74
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:54,060
chaos panic and ultimately despair I

75
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,220
won't go into the chaos and panic but

76
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:01,260
you can be sure that you know most of it

77
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:05,600
was probably my fault and it actually

78
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:09,030
all came together on Wednesday I had

79
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:12,480
sent the email to the assembly house

80
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,790
saying we have to come to reality here

81
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,940
and that you know this just isn't gonna

82
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,370
happen and we this is all my fault and I

83
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,260
accept this and you know we'll we'll try

84
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,990
to get badges out to people you know

85
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,460
maybe a month after a con and they sent

86
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,180
me back email saying we're rolling we're

87
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,180
gonna make deadline

88
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:37,440
so an emotional rollercoaster and then

89
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,050
they called me a little bit later and

90
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,080
said hey you know the battery is

91
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,960
backwards and you can't insert or remove

92
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,500
the battery without ripping components

93
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,219
off the board and and I asked them well

94
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,860
you know how many have you assembled

95
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:01,740
where we've identified this problem and

96
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:03,750
and they wrote back 300 and they said

97
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,840
well you know I I think we can I think

98
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:09,810
we can hand rework all these it'll it'll

99
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,780
it'll just it'll just be a little bit of

100
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,890
money and and overtime and and I I was

101
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,960
unsure but Dean said yeah let's do it so

102
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:21,659
unbelievably amongst overcoming all

103
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,520
obstacles they assembled it all we

104
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:29,070
picked it up on West on Thursday

105
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,960
afternoon we assembled it all at control

106
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,760
you know got the wheels on the batteries

107
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,419
programming a controller tested them and

108
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,070
oh my god they work and we had a

109
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:44,010
hundred percent yield this has never

110
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:46,260
ever happened to me before if someone

111
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,940
told me that they did their badges and

112
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,349
they got a hundred percent yield I would

113
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,450
think that they like really planned

114
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,550
everything really well and everything

115
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,460
went according to plan and I know that

116
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,250
that's totally not true in this case

117
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:03,390
lots and lots of people lots and lots of

118
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,890
people helped do this and and they're

119
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,550
way too many to think there was an

120
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:10,200
entire crew of people there was entire

121
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,630
crew people who truly test night working

122
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,680
feverishly hard and it's amazing to see

123
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,570
everyone come together and I'm

124
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,680
tremendously thankful for everyone to

125
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,320
help make this happen

126
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,710
I mostly won't I most of all want to I

127
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:26,460
want to thank our sponsors so ash Park

128
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:30,030
donated the PCBs which as per usual are

129
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:32,729
perfect purple PCBs Ruggero donated the

130
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,010
radial modules and cascade systems

131
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:37,690
heroically assembled this and donates

132
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:40,330
the assembly and

133
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:45,340
I really just again want to say thank

134
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:46,870
you to everyone oh and there's some sort

135
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:57,070
of hacking you can do with the badge I

136
00:06:46,870 --> 00:07:01,030
think there is a badge hacking contest

137
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:04,780
you should hack your badge and there

138
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:06,880
will be some sort of judging ceremony

139
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:17,950
later to be announced because I didn't

140
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:20,230
plan ahead and with that so also like

141
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,909
Joe finally came because the speaker's

142
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,840
wrangled the guy that's wrangling

143
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:27,610
speakers so yay Joe I was gonna say

144
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,940
something I was gonna be relevant but I

145
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:36,550
don't know what it was so yeah it's been

146
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,250
pretty cool to have badges every year so

147
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,650
ash Park has donated the PCBs that's

148
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,810
four years now this is the first year we

149
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,950
had ragazzo support us by contributing

150
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,610
the little modules those tiny little

151
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:50,950
modules in the back and CST did the

152
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,920
assembly so it's really great to get all

153
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,670
these different sources helping us to

154
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,650
make this happen

155
00:07:54,670 --> 00:08:00,430
they're all nice local companies that we

156
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,200
really like and it's also really nice

157
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,700
that Mike keeps doing it because every

158
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,270
single year he says he's not allowed to

159
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:09,640
do badge again and he does and I don't

160
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,710
actually you know he's not allowed to

161
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,500
bad again let's take let's revisit this

162
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:17,890
in a few months maybe he'll forget or

163
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,480
maybe everyone also forgets but so yeah

164
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,950
that's it or maybe there's someone in

165
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,100
the audience who's designed a really

166
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,930
awesome badge in the past year and would

167
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:31,690
like to you know volunteer to be the new

168
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:34,740
badge person and hint so yeah thank you

169
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:37,330
and thanks Mike and here we go Topher

170
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,700
speaking of doing stuff for some reason

171
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,320
Joe keeps asking me to do things and I

172
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,960
say yes without actually knowing what

173
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,970
the role entails one of which was

174
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,610
leading all of the events and contests

175
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,710
and building the CTF again this year

176
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,450
so I

177
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,640
this is besides it's a security

178
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,620
conference so a big portion of what

179
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,500
people come for all that are the talks

180
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,850
but for people that you know don't want

181
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,520
to go to every single talk and every

182
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,560
single track there's typically you know

183
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,270
other events and happenings going on so

184
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,189
you can interact with other people or

185
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,470
you know try out your hacking skills or

186
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,060
whatever you want to participate in so

187
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:16,080
this year we actually have a really

188
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:18,660
awesome contest and event set up and is

189
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,610
you know is common in a lot of hacker

190
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,850
conferences these days we have a really

191
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,320
awesome CTF which we'll talk about so as

192
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,820
far as the contests and events that are

193
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,690
going to be happening for the duration

194
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,360
of 'besides

195
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,950
we have info set quiz show so this has

196
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,140
been going on for a couple of years now

197
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,970
last year was a huge success how many

198
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,150
people actually participated or watch

199
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,160
this last year yeah a couple of people

200
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,079
great so Steve's doing a really great

201
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,589
job with this and pretty much what it is

202
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,750
is you've all seen this show Jeopardy so

203
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,670
think of this as hacker jeopardy it's a

204
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,680
series of questions and and whatnot to

205
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,300
the to the competitors but they all have

206
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,969
you know some sort of computer or

207
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,920
security theme so some of the questions

208
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:06,030
are you know what's the best text editor

209
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:08,219
and the only answer of course is why so

210
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:11,699
so it's fun it's you know it's got some

211
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,100
comedy aspect to it and it's great there

212
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,590
aren't that many people currently signed

213
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,570
up to be actual competitors for it so I

214
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:21,570
encourage you to go to the b-sides

215
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,730
website and sign up to compete it's a

216
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,620
lot of fun and there's really awesome

217
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:29,700
prizes that will be delivered during the

218
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,260
closing ceremony when is what oh the

219
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,560
quiz show yeah so the quiz show is

220
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,230
happening tonight at 5:00 it's like 5:15

221
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,910
to 6:00 or whenever it ends at UM it's

222
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:43,470
on the schedule as well there's also

223
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,910
this thing called Carmageddon that

224
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,020
Dean's been running for the last two

225
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:51,660
years how many people like reddit here

226
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:55,770
how many people like shitposting you

227
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,839
should play this game so the intention

228
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,430
of this is essentially shitpost as much

229
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,050
as you can on reddit and collect all of

230
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,250
the karma and the person with the most

231
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,109
karma wins

232
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,230
and is the you know the best poster

233
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,880
it besides PDX I'm looking I'm looking

234
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:14,400
at one person in particular that should

235
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:17,300
do pretty well at this I'm saying a sign

236
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,920
up there is also prizes for this and

237
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,780
then coming back this year and this is

238
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,329
an event that hasn't really been widely

239
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:27,060
publicized so it hasn't really taken off

240
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,860
but we as the organizers feel that there

241
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,849
is merit to it is this notion of a

242
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:35,670
technical book swap so like you know

243
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,530
like all of you I assume I have books on

244
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,910
my shelf that I've read that I will

245
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,770
never pick up again because I've either

246
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,300
gone through the material or it's no

247
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,310
longer relevant for what I care about

248
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,140
and it would be cool from a community

249
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,550
standpoint to be able to give that away

250
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,699
to people or exchange it for another

251
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:53,310
book that I want so this this you know

252
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,470
informal event in the event room there's

253
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,780
a table next to all of the lanyards

254
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,750
which is also a cool thing that's like

255
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,970
looking for work and looking to hire

256
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,310
particularly for Portland hires so it's

257
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,870
you know community driven go go through

258
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,250
your resume on there get hired but also

259
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,780
at the same time there's the book swap

260
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,910
happening on top of it to learn more

261
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,130
technical skills or to give those skills

262
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,900
to the community so I encourage you and

263
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,550
I'm it's likely that you didn't know

264
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,990
about this today but if you know going

265
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,099
home tonight you look at your shelf and

266
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,230
there's some books that you'd want to

267
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,400
contribute to this event I encourage you

268
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:29,220
to do so and put them on that event

269
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:33,770
table um I don't know maybe maybe don't

270
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,770
have stuff about like you know X I net D

271
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:40,280
can be whatever if somebody doesn't take

272
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,280
it it's you know take it back whatever

273
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:49,650
that sounds fun do you have books should

274
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:58,500
bring those books in and see if somebody

275
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:59,939
wants to learn that crap also for the

276
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,089
first time this year we have this thing

277
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:06,180
called engineering stories so an Meixner

278
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:08,190
is going to be around Friday today from

279
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,020
1 to 5 and Saturday from 1 to 4 and

280
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,209
essentially what she's doing is she's

281
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,740
taking peoples engineering stories how

282
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,829
they built something what they're trying

283
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,960
to build and curating it on

284
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,090
her blog Engineering's daughter with the

285
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,100
intention of this being you know

286
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,710
community involvement and community

287
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,260
feedback on solving actual engineering

288
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:29,000
problems or the struggles that one faces

289
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:33,950
while trying to solve those problems

290
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,370
she's trying to you know get get

291
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,960
questions curated to pertain to certain

292
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,400
communities one of which of course is

293
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,610
security since she's donating her time

294
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,410
for b-sides and we'll take your stories

295
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,440
and post them on her blog and in such a

296
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,030
way that you know reflects the struggles

297
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,910
or the challenges that you've overcame

298
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,680
in some of these engineering tasks all

299
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,230
of that information is going to be in

300
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,390
the event room and on the website and

301
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,700
there will be a sign-up sheet so she's

302
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:04,670
going to be doing 20 minutes lots of

303
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,140
interviews and we'll take you know a set

304
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,579
amount of stories and actually post

305
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,840
those on the blog and we'll get the

306
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,850
access tomb as well and we'll put them

307
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,680
on the b-sides website so this is

308
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,770
something that we've never tried before

309
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,630
it has promise but it's going to take

310
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,460
people to actually go out and give those

311
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,080
interviews and see how it goes with your

312
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,820
story that you have to tell because all

313
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,820
of us have something to say

314
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,630
there's also coming back again this year

315
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,280
lock-picking village so this is the

316
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,140
thing that it wasn't necessarily known

317
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,760
if it was going to happen and then Kenny

318
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,890
miraculously sent out to the mailing

319
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,040
list I think Thursday afternoon that hey

320
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:42,020
I'm gonna be at b-sides so this has been

321
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,730
happening for you know several years and

322
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,890
it the majority of hacker conferences

323
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,230
there is you know a lockpick village

324
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,270
happening um so this is really really

325
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,460
excellent to have and kudos to Kenny in

326
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:56,270
the tool chapter of Portland for putting

327
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,590
this on again this year so those are the

328
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,100
majority of the contests and events

329
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:03,560
happening in the room and now really and

330
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,510
this is biased for me as somebody that

331
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,699
was a part of the organization of the

332
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,800
CTF and somebody that is really into

333
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,960
hands-on skills and I feel that CTF is a

334
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,729
really excellent learning platform both

335
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,680
to practice offensive security skills

336
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:19,280
and defensive security skills which I'll

337
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,109
talk about in my talk tomorrow but if

338
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,760
you're not familiar capture-the-flag is

339
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,950
essentially a computer security

340
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,730
competition or is if you watch mr. robot

341
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:30,430
how he put it hacker jeopardy or or the

342
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,630
hacker Olympic

343
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,069
so it's essentially you'll you'll be

344
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,750
presented with you know a series of

345
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,060
challenges whether their web binary

346
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,710
forensics reverse engineering and the

347
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,989
intent is to solve the challenge and

348
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,760
such the in such a way that at the end

349
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,500
you get a flag out and then you cat that

350
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,660
flag to a scoreboard and you get points

351
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,310
and the person with the most points is

352
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,730
you know they win the CTF and they're

353
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:56,270
that they won the hacker Olympics the

354
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:58,040
unfortunate part about CTF is at a lot

355
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:01,579
of conferences especially save bigger

356
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,339
ones like Def Con for example the CTF s

357
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,830
have a really really difficult barrier

358
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,330
to entry and people feel discouraged

359
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,010
from participating because they don't

360
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,380
think that they have the skills in order

361
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,700
to solve even the you know the basic 100

362
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,730
level challenges because at these

363
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,130
conferences they're not basic the whole

364
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,290
idea behind b-sides which was reflected

365
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:24,020
by Joe during the opening ceremony is

366
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,480
this as an event for people that are new

367
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:29,030
they're incoming it gives them an

368
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,060
opportunity to voice their ideas and get

369
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:34,339
started so we kind of take that notion

370
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,560
and put it into the CTF so these

371
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,180
challenges are you know amateur to

372
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,270
intermediate there's nothing that should

373
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:44,089
be that tricky or surprising to somebody

374
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,410
that's new and I say this not as you

375
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,940
know if you're new and you can't solve

376
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,579
these I'm not saying that's bad I'm

377
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,620
saying it's a way that you know we have

378
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:55,870
things like buffer overflows that have

379
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:58,540
been existing since 1983 or whatever and

380
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,620
they're not things that are meant to

381
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,439
discourage you from playing and it's a

382
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,030
really good way to gain skills that can

383
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,980
take you further in your exploitation

384
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:12,230
career so this year we developed 16

385
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,660
challenges across four domains so it's a

386
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,689
four by four scoreboard we have web

387
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:20,720
binary exploitation reverse engineering

388
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:22,100
and shellcode challenges speaking of you

389
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,990
know useless books that you might not

390
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:28,369
want to read does anybody know how to

391
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,360
how to write MIPS you should play CTF

392
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:34,899
because one of the shell coding

393
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,899
challenges is MIPS you're welcome

394
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:43,289
so one of the hardest parts about CTF

395
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,549
isn't necessarily the challenge writing

396
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:50,250
it's how you're going to host the

397
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:51,900
challenges so in the past at some of the

398
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,270
CTF events that have been ran at besides

399
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,010
one year in 2015 we actually had you

400
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,990
know a dedicated server sitting in the

401
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,640
event room it was all a local subnet and

402
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,200
you just connected to the server with

403
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,419
you know the local network and there was

404
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,190
no internet access to it which is cool

405
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,860
but then you know you can't go on Google

406
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,919
and try to get help from things and read

407
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:14,189
you know the manual for poem tools or

408
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:17,070
whatever so last year what we wound up

409
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:20,039
doing is Jesse and I at our old

410
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,918
organization wrote a series of

411
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:24,559
challenges for the CW top 25 which are

412
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,429
the top 25 most pertinent

413
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,260
vulnerabilities across the software

414
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:30,720
domain including you know binary and web

415
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,000
and we took those and we're like okay

416
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,010
let's make the b-sides PDX CTF out of

417
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,110
this because this is very much driven to

418
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,299
the this is intermediate and amateur and

419
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,740
most people from reading these articles

420
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,830
about these vulnerabilities that have

421
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,210
been existing for years can solve them

422
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,889
but then it became the question of how

423
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,230
do we actually host this infrastructure

424
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,850
in such a way that it's it's secure from

425
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,280
when somebody gets you know root shell

426
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,770
in a box or a shell on a box they're

427
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,450
limited to their executives and they

428
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,168
don't tear down the infrastructure or

429
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:03,780
we're giving them something unintended

430
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:06,830
so I reached out to my friend Andrew who

431
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:10,168
at the time was building a platform and

432
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,149
they agreed to let us use it and sponsor

433
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:14,520
the event so we wound up using if you

434
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:17,280
played CTF last year it was this really

435
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,320
awesome platform from Symantec where it

436
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,908
was fully isolated every player was

437
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,820
competing in their own you know little

438
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:29,039
sandbox and it worked out really really

439
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:31,168
well so going into this year I you know

440
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,970
DEFCON time knew I was gonna run the CTF

441
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:35,250
had no idea what the infrastructure was

442
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,500
gonna look like and of all things we're

443
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,710
sitting at the Flamingo in the Cabana

444
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,450
that Mozilla was hosting and you know

445
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,830
I'm talking about how last year's CTF

446
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,780
was a huge success and I didn't know

447
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,659
what to do this year but besides San

448
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,460
Francisco did a really cool thing where

449
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:52,320
kubernetes implementation and ran their

450
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,240
whole entire challenge in kubernetes and

451
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,540
the guys sitting next to me looked over

452
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,670
I'm the one that wrote that so I'm like

453
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,230
oh wait what this is amazing we should

454
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,030
connect and talk and he's like yeah you

455
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,100
know I kind of copy it from this

456
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:08,280
semantic platform and Andrea is like I

457
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,020
wrote that so it became this whole

458
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,020
little circle of you know it's a small

459
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,300
world and people that are designing and

460
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,570
hosting CTF somehow all wound up at the

461
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,909
same Cabana at the Flamingo so we all

462
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,800
coordinated with each other and wound up

463
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,960
with this really awesome infrastructure

464
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,960
platform this year it's all deployed in

465
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,490
AWS in Mozilla's instances actually and

466
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,260
then being one of our platinum sponsors

467
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,260
is totally wicked that we're able to

468
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,810
host in them and it's it's kubernetes

469
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,940
everything is built with docker which

470
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,800
we'll get into you know don't don't fret

471
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,330
it's actually not that bad how we're

472
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:48,060
doing it because you know docker

473
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:49,800
security oh my god don't do that so yeah

474
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,360
I'm gonna invite Youssef up on stage

475
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,740
from Mozilla I mean he's actually

476
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,570
visiting from out of the country they

477
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,790
flew him here from London just to give

478
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,679
just to build our infrastructure for us

479
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:07,290
and to give this little section of the

480
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:08,790
talk so welcome Youssef hi everybody I

481
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,970
only have a few minutes so this is going

482
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:14,550
to be a very very very quick run-through

483
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:18,360
of a lot of complex things so take this

484
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:22,139
more as a go forth and look at these

485
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:25,709
after after this talk but so yeah

486
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:29,280
running a CTF inside docker

487
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:31,380
doesn't sound like a great idea so these

488
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,610
are some of the things that we've worked

489
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:38,280
on too so sort of harden up the

490
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:41,189
kubernetes cluster in case the docker

491
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:45,030
security fails so one of the first

492
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:46,860
things and sort of the key the key

493
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:49,020
security mechanism right now for

494
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:52,050
kubernetes is robeast access control and

495
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:55,830
so essentially that's what it says on

496
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:58,500
the tin it's you define roles and you

497
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:00,070
combined it to various resources inside

498
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,550
of kubernetes

499
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:08,379
and it allows controls the controls

500
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:12,510
access to the API and so by by default

501
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:14,920
in earlier versions of kubernetes

502
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,690
role-based access control isn't enabled

503
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,610
by default so anything running inside

504
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,700
the cursor has completely administrator

505
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:24,520
access to the API and also by default in

506
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,530
kubernetes is anytime a pod so a

507
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,860
container a set of containers is

508
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:32,050
deployed in kubernetes a service account

509
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:35,429
token is mounted inside the pod that

510
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,720
gives access to the API so by default

511
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,760
every container inside the curse that

512
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,820
has cluster level cluster level

513
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:48,340
administrative privileges which isn't

514
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:51,399
great so from Cuban se is 1.6 and a

515
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:54,060
later it's enabled by default but a lot

516
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,800
of people end up disabling it because

517
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,230
there are some services that don't

518
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,419
support car back but like helm for

519
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:04,270
instance the package manager or they

520
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,980
just created their cluster before it was

521
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,930
enabled by default so if there's

522
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,000
anything to take from take from my

523
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:12,460
section it's just enable are back on

524
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,580
your cluster or create it when you're

525
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,320
creating your cursor the next big thing

526
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,300
I'm going to talk about is container

527
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:24,000
networking and the new network policy

528
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:26,580
resource in in kubernetes by default

529
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,590
kubernetes uses cube net as its

530
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:32,320
container networking overlay which is

531
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:34,090
sort of really simple it does the basics

532
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,020
there is no sort of cross node

533
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:41,590
networking or network policy

534
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,360
implementation so for any production

535
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:46,060
kubernetes cluster I just recommend

536
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,760
using one of the other networking

537
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:53,350
plugins like calico weave that kind of

538
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:55,810
thing if you are using calico on AWS

539
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,490
just remember to change the disable

540
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:59,169
source destination checks otherwise

541
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:03,160
nothing will work and you'll spend a

542
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:05,470
half a day try figure out why yeah and

543
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,080
so another thing the besides

544
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:10,600
infrastructure was created using K ops

545
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,409
which made this thing super easy so as

546
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,629
you can see there there's a simple four

547
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:17,000
to just enable character networking you

548
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,650
don't have to worry about anything

549
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,420
inside the curse the same with our back

550
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,270
there's authentication equals our back

551
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:26,540
super easy to do with K ops we love it

552
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:28,700
happens illa so and it covers a lot of

553
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:32,830
use cases for most people who want to

554
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:37,160
use kubernetes and so yeah cocoa enable

555
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:39,439
implements the network policy and so by

556
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,120
default there are no network policies

557
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,760
defines that all traffic can run inside

558
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,550
of the cluster which doesn't really help

559
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,490
us much so this is sort of a sample

560
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:51,290
configuration Network policy that will

561
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:54,260
just deny all ingress traffic to all

562
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,850
pods and so that gives you a good

563
00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:00,560
starting point from there you can

564
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:02,929
whitelist whitelist the networking you

565
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,590
want to do so this is on the left here a

566
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:08,450
super simple nginx pod that exposes port

567
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:12,709
80 and on the right here we have a

568
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:16,430
network policy that simply put allows

569
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:19,850
all traffic into port AC on that on

570
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:21,410
their nginx pod and so when you get in

571
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:25,100
you can do more complex things with this

572
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:30,500
as well so for instance here we'd have a

573
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:35,090
a memcache D pod and this network policy

574
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:37,640
will allow it to allow the web pods to

575
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,409
communicate with that so instantly right

576
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,780
there we're separating out

577
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:44,690
isolating each of these services from

578
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,970
each other so in case one gets pwned

579
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:50,630
people won't be able to move across the

580
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:53,360
applications inside the core so some

581
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,370
other things that I'm going to briefly

582
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,850
touch on not go into too much detail on

583
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:00,580
these is the pod security policy and

584
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:03,230
mission controller this lets you control

585
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,810
what kind of dock and containers can be

586
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:09,710
run the main use case for that is to

587
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:13,310
disable host networking if if somebody

588
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:15,620
is able to deploy pods inside of the

589
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:17,480
cluster with hosts networking completely

590
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,629
bypasses all of that network policy

591
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,010
stuff so that all becomes a moot point

592
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:25,610
the node restriction admissions

593
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:27,440
controller so one thing in coop

594
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:30,678
Nettie's is that cubits the nodes that

595
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,160
run the containers by default have

596
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,740
access to all the sort of the secrets

597
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:38,150
every service in the cursor needs to run

598
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:42,650
the node restriction emission controller

599
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:44,870
makes it so that only the the queue only

600
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:47,210
the secrets that the cube Allah is

601
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:50,479
actually going to run it has access to

602
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:52,809
so it can see everything inside of the

603
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,850
cluster so it's at least privileged

604
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:59,389
using certificate authentication for

605
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:01,639
cubits and Etsy D you can enable our

606
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,440
back but it doesn't really help much if

607
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,330
people can just write and read the state

608
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,830
of Etsy D directory you can just

609
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:11,199
bypassed all of that role based access

610
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:13,639
and specifically for AWS your procure

611
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:19,540
your containers are probably going to

612
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:25,070
interact with the other AWS services and

613
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:28,129
the buy in AWS you can only assign I am

614
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:30,559
permissions to an AWS instance not by

615
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:33,020
container and the metadata proxy is able

616
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,790
to sort of transparently assume

617
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,950
different AWS roles for different

618
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:39,500
containers so you don't have to give a

619
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:42,080
broad set of AWS permissions to all of

620
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,500
the services running in the kubernetes

621
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,299
cluster so yeah I know that was a really

622
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,970
big information dump but I'd recommend

623
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:51,230
going off searching all of this stuff if

624
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,290
you're running or want to run a

625
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,910
kubernetes cluster then you have come

626
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:58,668
talk to me if you have questions about

627
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,970
this I believe now I'm going to hand

628
00:27:58,669 --> 00:28:05,360
over to Andrew who's going to talk about

629
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:08,450
the fun prizes you can get if you manage

630
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,919
to rig the cluster thank you

631
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:15,240
[Applause]

632
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,330
so there's a kind of one more thing

633
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,690
about the CTF that we were able to add

634
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:23,639
at the last minute so mo Zilla we have

635
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:26,010
this checklist of security principles

636
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,410
before we put something into our

637
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:31,170
production environment there's 12 and 4

638
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:33,060
categories I think and once one of those

639
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:35,370
things reaches that level of maturity we

640
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,480
put in what's called our core bug bounty

641
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:43,860
program who knows what a bug bounty is

642
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,720
who likes cash so we've decided for

643
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,969
b-sides since this is our reference

644
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,710
implementation of kubernetes running

645
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,110
these challenges in what we believe is

646
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,870
our most secure configuration that we

647
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:58,350
will consider this cluster in scope for

648
00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:01,260
our core bug bounty program so if you

649
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,570
can pivot out of one of the b-sides

650
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:07,770
challenges and you can hack the cluster

651
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:09,659
itself please find me and I will connect

652
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:13,940
you with our bug bounty people and you

653
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:16,620
will get a substantial pile of cash so

654
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,420
you have a my boss over there Jeff

655
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,770
Reiner to thank for putting this in

656
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,890
scope for the bug bounty program so

657
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,570
thanks Jeff and I'm so glad that we

658
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:31,170
could be here and do the infrastructure

659
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:34,590
for this event and I mean as far as CTFs

660
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:37,230
are concerned right I mean you're giving

661
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:39,510
people intentionally vulnerable

662
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,280
challenges and in some cases especially

663
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,140
for Epona Buhl's category of challenges

664
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:47,190
the whole intent is to cap that flag

665
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:49,980
when you're running commands as you know

666
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:51,720
a user on a container so there's been a

667
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,180
lot of really fascinating talks about

668
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:59,280
kubernetes security particularly stuff

669
00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:01,770
from Dino capsulate he did a talk

670
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,330
recently at one of his security meetup

671
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:05,100
groups in New York City where he showed

672
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:08,100
in about eight minutes how if you have

673
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,620
code exec on a on a kubernetes pod like

674
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,360
a docker container basically in five

675
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,790
commands you own the whole entire

676
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,350
environment so the whole notion of this

677
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,389
particularly around the bug bounty is

678
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,429
that should not be possible in this and

679
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,440
if you get code exec and one of the

680
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,400
challenges which is intentional you

681
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,820
shouldn't be able to do anything

682
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,680
more than that so we're really stuck

683
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:32,260
tobacco structure this year we believe

684
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,090
it's a secures can be for a CTF where

685
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,430
you know you don't necessarily have to

686
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,050
be a good developer to write CTF

687
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,230
challenges because the whole intent is

688
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:44,320
they are hackable so we'll see how it

689
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:46,180
goes with that said though there are a

690
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,939
lot of things as a challenge organizer

691
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,130
that we could have done a lot better so

692
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,080
one thing in particular is you'll notice

693
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,550
and I'll mention this in a little bit

694
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,290
but we're going to open source all of

695
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,270
the challenges including the

696
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,280
infrastructure code and you'll notice

697
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:03,070
that some of the code is you know slop

698
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,970
together which you know whatever like I

699
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,740
said you don't have to be a good

700
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,900
developer in order to write CTF which is

701
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,970
great but one of the things we're doing

702
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,590
is like using X I net D which of course

703
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,690
we all know is old and deprecated

704
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:17,500
because system D ate everything but at

705
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:19,150
the same time but it's system D so we

706
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,250
didn't use that this year but we can in

707
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:24,160
the future and you know if you look at

708
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,100
house ETF's are kind of modeled a lot of

709
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,390
challenges that people write will be

710
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,310
modeled after something else that

711
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:31,810
they've attacked or exploited whether or

712
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:34,179
not you're you know in a pen test role

713
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:35,830
or a red team role a lot of the ideas

714
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,630
and inspiration for challenges you as a

715
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,639
Content developer come up with are

716
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:41,350
things that you've previously done which

717
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,760
makes it really interesting and you know

718
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,290
if you go on the internet a lot of stuff

719
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,290
is still running X inot D so this is

720
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:48,820
totally legit

721
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:53,139
another thing is starting earlier in the

722
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:54,730
year so like I said this a lot of the

723
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,950
inspiration for this really came from

724
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,570
randomly meeting people at Def Con at

725
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:01,360
the Cabana especially the infrastructure

726
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:03,669
side and we hadn't necessarily planned

727
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,889
from an organizational perspective how

728
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:08,590
many challenges we wanted to do and who

729
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,610
was gonna write them and I actually got

730
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,919
an email

731
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:14,800
Eric wound up talking to Joe I think or

732
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,480
Dean and was I want to help out with the

733
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,040
CTF of besides this year who do I talk

734
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,320
to and I got you know an email in my

735
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,080
inbox took about a month to actually

736
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,120
meet up and go over what the intent was

737
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,949
which is going into another thing to do

738
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,929
better which is more organizers and

739
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,640
organization so other than the

740
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,400
infrastructure side which we were pretty

741
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,700
hands-off with it was two people that

742
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,900
wrote all 16 challenges which if you

743
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,270
look at say

744
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,309
other CTF teams there's a lot more than

745
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:45,190
two people doing the doing the work and

746
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:47,500
in a lot of cases particularly say what

747
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:49,480
legit BS was doing at DEFCON they

748
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,920
treated it as a second full-time job

749
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,290
which of course we didn't necessarily

750
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:59,260
have the resources nor manpower to do so

751
00:32:53,290 --> 00:33:01,149
and having lives is kind of cool it can

752
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,070
be there is a comment that it's kind of

753
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:06,430
overrated but yeah I mean what's life

754
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:08,350
right but there's you know certainly

755
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:10,630
room to improve for organizers and

756
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:13,419
organization of the event before it

757
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,590
actually happens at b-sides so if you

758
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,240
want to you know get involved with

759
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:18,010
organization or you feel that you have a

760
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,960
really unique idea for a challenge and

761
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,150
you want to contribute come talk to me

762
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,860
and we can make that happen for next

763
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,200
year I'll also probably do a better job

764
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,149
and actually have you know comms reached

765
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,490
out whether or not it be on Twitter or

766
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:33,040
the besides PDX Google group to get some

767
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,960
more assistance with this and then of

768
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,620
course continue to improve our

769
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,390
kubernetes cluster and our AWS infra I

770
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:42,010
anticipate this going really well this

771
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,440
weekend and I hope that we can utilize

772
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:47,230
Mozilla for next year from the

773
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,510
infrastructural standpoint also you'll

774
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,130
notice and this is sad because we had

775
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:55,379
this epiphany this morning as we were

776
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,380
setting up there's no live scoreboard

777
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:04,030
how did we not think of this so I want

778
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,678
to get Eric up here just so people can

779
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:08,620
see see him because he put in a

780
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,320
substantial amount of work with me this

781
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:13,000
year and he reached out to me I didn't

782
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,500
reach out to him and without his help I

783
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,030
don't think I would have been able to do

784
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,710
16 challenges and get all of the

785
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,929
infrastructure and organization done by

786
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,449
myself so Eric wanted to say something

787
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:25,000
really quickly about that yeah just a

788
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:26,678
few quick comments like Topher said in

789
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,270
the beginning a lot of CTF challenges

790
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,040
have a really high barrier to entry with

791
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:32,168
this one in particular we really went

792
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,330
for breadth over depth so if you're a

793
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:36,129
person who's maybe heard of sequel

794
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:39,219
injection or heard of a buffer overflow

795
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:42,460
or wants to do things that normally

796
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:44,500
might get you a CFAA investigation this

797
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:47,199
is the time and place to do it if you're

798
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,030
new we really encourage you reach out to

799
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,290
one of us will probably be at the CTF

800
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,300
table

801
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:54,909
somewhere around here and and we can

802
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:57,310
help you get started we're friendly we

803
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:59,200
don't bite and really encourage you if

804
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:02,049
you've never done a CTF before this is a

805
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,830
great contest to start so that's all

806
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:08,200
thanks and then of course big thanks

807
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,520
again to the Mozilla team and them

808
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,140
hosting the infrastructure in getting

809
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,670
our kubernetes cluster for us and the

810
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:16,500
surprise bug bounty program for their

811
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,500
core bug bounty which is totally awesome

812
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:21,700
so one thing that doesn't necessarily

813
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,520
happen after a CTF event is organizers

814
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,960
will you know they'll make they'll

815
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,030
they'll put their events on a repository

816
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,920
and have people contribute write-ups for

817
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,570
how people solve challenges but nobody

818
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,060
necessarily published a source for how

819
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,590
those challenges were created and I

820
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,660
think that's a shame I think that

821
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:39,150
sharing as an organizer the the

822
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,500
challenges that were created showing

823
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,330
showcasing you know how I thought a

824
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,160
particular vulnerability worked and how

825
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:47,680
I wanted it to be exploited as valuable

826
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,230
to bring the community forward both from

827
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,759
learning how not to write code or if you

828
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,010
are an organizer learning how to write

829
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,570
vulnerable code intentionally and then

830
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,670
also showing you know if somebody is

831
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,410
completely stuck and they're trying to

832
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,820
solve challenges afterwards which with

833
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,220
this you'll be able to do everything is

834
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,380
going to be a single docker compost

835
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:08,140
command to bring everything up locally

836
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:10,600
on your box after the event it's really

837
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,279
useful to have source and I want to you

838
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,410
know try to get a movement started

839
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,940
within the CTF organization space of

840
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:19,720
people publishing source after their

841
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:21,550
events also of course there's awesome

842
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,200
prizes this year for the CTF so be sure

843
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,420
to come to closing ceremonies I'll do

844
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,000
statistics of how many teams played how

845
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:30,070
many solves there were there and that

846
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,420
sort of thing also like I said if you

847
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,860
want to be involved next year whether or

848
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,390
not it be with planning challenge

849
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,550
writing or helping out with

850
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:38,290
infrastructure please reach out to me I

851
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,390
would love help and I would love to get

852
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:42,970
this going is a bigger event at besides

853
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:44,680
every year so yeah

854
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,169
come play CTF it's in the event room we

855
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:52,330
have dedicated Wi-Fi besides PDX CTF

856
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:53,830
party there's also a series of evening

857
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:56,740
activities happening throughout this

858
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,480
throughout this conference so last night

859
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,549
as you've heard there were a bunch of

860
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,490
hackers meeting up a control age where

861
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,260
we assembled all the badges I play

862
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,939
tested some of

863
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,580
cetf to make sure the environment was

864
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,680
still stable after we made our

865
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:13,620
kubernetes cluster a little bit better

866
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,390
last night but with that said they're

867
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:18,120
one of our sponsors Thursday nights are

868
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:20,009
always open house Wednesday nights Deane

869
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,600
leads a thing called exploit workshop

870
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,370
and it's usually a pretty good turnout

871
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,589
of people just hacking on stuff and

872
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,549
exploiting things like you know if

873
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,380
you're familiar with the crack

874
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,910
vulnerability that just came out play

875
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,710
people were just playing around with

876
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,029
that willy-nilly and having fun and

877
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:39,020
seeing how vulnerable their phones were

878
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:41,250
that'll never get patched also tonight

879
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:43,410
technology diversified is hosting an

880
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,570
after-party at Pascal this is a new

881
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:47,279
hacker space in the area it's fairly

882
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,200
recent and they're going to have things

883
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,540
like retro games lock-picking badge

884
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,740
hacking music hacker bingo and then

885
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,850
they're also gonna have a couple of

886
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:58,319
tables to further play the CTF event

887
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,940
there's there's a meet-up page for it

888
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,220
it's linked to you on the website it you

889
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,370
know the events page for contests and

890
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:09,779
really the event begins at 6:30 so you

891
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:11,609
know go get your drink on tomorrow night

892
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,650
there's also going to be another after

893
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:15,510
party of course everybody's going to be

894
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,640
really tired especially those that

895
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:20,160
organize the event but you know there's

896
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,859
always room for drinking so there'll be

897
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,950
another event at control H between 8:00

898
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,360
and 10:00 over which isn't that far from

899
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,980
here you can literally just hop on the

900
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,360
max yellow line it drops you off right

901
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:36,390
at the front door and that's the end of

902
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,820
the slide deck I don't know if people

903
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:40,350
wanted to ask questions totally open for

904
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,330
that in the spirit of this being a 1 a

905
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:45,569
101 talk and nothing you know being

906
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:52,590
rehearsed and do it live mentality we

907
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:54,750
did it live yeah so the closing

908
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:58,830
ceremonies are at 4:00 it will be done

909
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:01,740
around 4:30 and then I will get push so

910
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,850
tonight or tomorrow night it'll be

911
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,209
pretty instant everything's already

912
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:07,710
ready we had it on bit bitbucket because

913
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,990
you know they support private repos for

914
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,400
free because github you know for some

915
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:14,100
reason likes to charge people lots of

916
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,180
money to have open source things so yeah

917
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,180
it'll be available tomorrow

918
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:25,189
yeah yes

919
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:34,020
soon I will I will clean up all the

920
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:36,060
swear words in the schematics and then I

921
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,870
will push them to get and I'll tweet it

922
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:49,290
out I should do that soon

923
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:53,549
like maybe after this also also we'll

924
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:56,160
have the schematics the source file the

925
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:58,580
source for flashing lists and like a

926
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,790
rough series of instructions basically

927
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:04,740
you need the NR the NRF SDK to blow the

928
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,150
bootloader but that if you wedge your

929
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:09,209
bootloader but that's already done but

930
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:15,000
this is an RF Arduino project so if you

931
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:20,040
just download the Arduino NRF 50 X

932
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:23,460
because it's 51 50 and 52 SDK well done

933
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:26,580
the Arduino runtime for it then you can

934
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:29,150
flash it directly through the UART

935
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,150
connector of the back

936
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:45,859
I'll publish a bomb cool well thanks

937
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:48,320
everybody for coming to b-sides enjoy

938
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,360
all the presentations enjoy the events

939
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,830
and contests enjoy the parties and let's

940
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:58,409
hack the planet together

941
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:58,409
[Applause]

942
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,740
you
