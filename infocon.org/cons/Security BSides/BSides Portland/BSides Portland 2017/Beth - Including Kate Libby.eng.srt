I am Beth I'm going to talk about

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,529
including Kate Libby so how many people

4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,619

5
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,419

6
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,680
okay so there's a few people how do

7
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:37,290
people have heard of or seen sneakers

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,280
yes okay audience participation is gonna

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:50,280
work except now I'm all locked out

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:52,530
what's my password so forgive me there's

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,280
actually one side that I have that was

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,879
meant to be animation but Wi-Fi is not

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,890
loving me today

14
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,199
so Who am I you're probably thinking who

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,210
is this crazy person aside from the fact

16
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,350
that my fabulous green matches my

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,940
cthulhu who else am i I am a product

18
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,789
manager for an autonomous driving

19
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:17,039
vehicle company called poly sync I have

20
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,899
no relationship to Tesla or some of the

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,869
things that they're doing but I'm sure

22
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:24,600
they're fine I've been in the tech

23
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,880
industry as a product manager just as a

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,210
product manager not just tech in general

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,920
for 15 years that means that I've made

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,530
it five years longer than most women

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,659
most women opt out at ten because

28
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,610
they're just sick of it and they don't

29
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,320
feel included and they don't feel like

30
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,909
they have a say or they can make a

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,460
difference they hit the glass ceiling

32
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:52,829
they're like screw it out so I'm I have

33
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,740
been lucky enough that I have people had

34
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,529
people who have been in dev ops and

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,899
security the InfoSec community and the

36
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,299
ops community have been tremendous for

37
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,030
me they have been so helpful they have

38
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,369
been supportive they have been kind they

39
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,619
have introduced me to people they have

40
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,940
backed me when people have come after me

41
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,830
for a variety of different reasons

42
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,150
you're not technical enough you don't

43
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,490
know what you're doing you haven't been

44
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,310
in the industry long enough I have so

45
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,000
much love for this community it is not

46
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,550
even funny

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,970
which is why I want to make it so much

48
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,190
better the other thing I've done is

49
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,050
I've assisted in planning the very first

50
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,690
herecan I'm pretty proud of that I

51
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,660
worked with Sarah that's how we met

52
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,760
that was a women in InfoSec on during

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,549
DEFCON I believe it was one of the first

54
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,140
ones so you had career con you had here

55
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,030
a con and there weren't a whole lot of

56
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,489
options if you weren't within a

57
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,380
particular box and so it was great to

58
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,860
have more options for people that were

59
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:55,769
safe spaces people need safe spaces so

60
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,110
that you can have some some people as

61
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,450
Don mentioned with unconscious bias

62
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,490
sometimes you need people and you need

63
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,739
that recharge so that you can be around

64
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,630
people who are like you but what I'm

65
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,370
gonna spend more time talking about is

66
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,160
how you reach out to people who are

67
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,380
different and there isn't a single thing

68
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,720
that I'm gonna talk about here that is

69
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,490
easy and there gonna be days where you

70
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,530
can't do it you don't feel like you've

71
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,000
done it and there's gonna be days where

72
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,940
you feel like you've taken ten steps

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,420
backwards totally fine that's life

74
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,240
it happens nobody's perfect the point is

75
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,268
be aware of it and do the very best that

76
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,800
you can

77
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:37,800
so I talked a lot there didn't I and

78
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,080
that was just all about me so why is it

79
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,650
is inclusion important

80
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,000
so today InfoSec is 11% women I think I

81
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:51,360
looked at last year and it was 10

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,220
percent who you gained a percent 1% but

83
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,590
here's the thing I'm not gonna talk to

84
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,540
you about sis white women I feel like if

85
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,410
you only talk about sis white women you

86
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,900
are not including all negatively

87
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:08,359
impacted groups and all negatively

88
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:11,519
impacted groups look and feel and art

89
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,370
have all the same things that sis white

90
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,798
women so I'm I understand I'm up here as

91
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,750
a woman talking about this but I am NOT

92
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,250
just talking about me and I am NOT

93
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,000
making it about people who look just

94
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,780
like me I'm explicitly not so please if

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,580
you take it in that way shape or for her

96
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:33,210
let me know raise your hand and go dude

97
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:36,479
what are you talking about so some of

98
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:38,580
the groups that are included in this but

99
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,760
this is not the complete group are

100
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,979
people regardless of ability

101
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,750
I like to pace a lot so it looks like

102
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,940
I'm bouncing around but it's because the

103
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,880
mic doesn't come with me so I apologize

104
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,940
I'm gonna try to center myself there so

105
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,830
people regardless of ability which I'm

106
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,800
one of those people who's a little a DD

107
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,930
I like to move around I have a hard time

108
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,630
sitting down it doesn't mean that I

109
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,480
can't do the job you have people who are

110
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,310
visually impaired who are hearing

111
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,590
impaired you have people who are color

112
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,010
blind you have people who have mental

113
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,020
illness PTSD you have people who have

114
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,900
hidden illnesses people who might have

115
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,190
lupus or other things and you can't see

116
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,020
that and you don't know what their

117
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,820
struggles are or why they're doing the

118
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,830
things that they are on a given point in

119
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:29,750
time each and every day so you you also

120
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,880
have people who are single parents and

121
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,530
they can't actually be in the office

122
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,870
from 8:00 to 5:00 because they have

123
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,400
other responsibilities does that mean

124
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,010
that they can't meet the minimum

125
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,280
qualifications by any stretch of the

126
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:49,700
imagination to do the job raise your

127
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:51,799
hand if you think the answer is yes so

128
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,780
one of the things that with all of this

129
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,970
I want people to start thinking about as

130
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,979
you're on hiring committees and as

131
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,340
you're doing other things if you are

132
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:03,230
helping to put together a job

133
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,479
description for somebody within your

134
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,720
group think about what are the actual

135
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,330
minimum qualifications and you have to

136
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,580
go back to that and make it things that

137
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,950
are quantifiable and have absolutely

138
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,820
nothing to do with that person as an

139
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:21,409
individual okay the other thing is

140
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,540
people regardless of sexual orientation

141
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,460
okay aside from the fact that this is a

142
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:29,920
protected class and we're still talking

143
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:33,770
about it mints - so 2017 hurts my soul

144
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,660
but this is a for-real thing and this is

145
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,909
something that people are often

146
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,250
discriminated against and they are

147
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,380
excluded they have glass ceilings

148
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,240
because they are part of this you should

149
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,180
be able to express and be who you are

150
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,300
regardless again have you met the

151
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,800
minimum qualifications to do the job

152
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,289
there is nothing about your sexual

153
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,180
orientation

154
00:06:53,289 --> 00:07:00,300
that means that you cannot meet the

155
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:04,749
minimum qualifications I say it wrong

156
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:07,180
you guys and then you have people from

157
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:10,149
all religious and ethnic backgrounds

158
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,680
okay so if you look at me and then like

159
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:14,139
if everybody were to come up here and

160
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,729
put their arms up next to my arm I would

161
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:18,219
guarantee you there's not a single

162
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:19,839
person who has the same color as me does

163
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:21,610
that mean that there is any one person

164
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:26,860
who has more qualified than the other to

165
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:28,689
do their job no you guys are great at

166
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,919
audience participation I've made it so

167
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:35,379
easy and then the last one is veterans

168
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,628
so I kind of have a special place in my

169
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:42,129
heart for veterans I grew up in a bit of

170
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:43,360
a rough area and there were I was there

171
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:47,919
were a number of people who were raised

172
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,909
by single moms or within who had who

173
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:54,430
were just poor so as you hit the age of

174
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:57,370
18 if you didn't have people who were

175
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:00,610
helping to guide you or you didn't I

176
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:03,129
have to go faster you weren't doing the

177
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:06,039
things that you needed to it's entirely

178
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:08,589
possible that the only option you had

179
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:11,308
was to join the military at the age of

180
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:13,599
18 because that was all that you had a

181
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:16,149
lot of people view people who were

182
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,610
military vets as like hey I like to go

183
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:20,199
out and shoot people up no it's because

184
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,330
they had no other choice

185
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,449
this is the option that they were given

186
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:29,589
so with that they also didn't have the

187
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:31,629
ability to network or do other things so

188
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:33,309
that's neat I just described you a whole

189
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:35,919
lot of problems tonight and you're

190
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:39,388
probably thinking oh my god all I hear

191
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,309
from me too and everything else is

192
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:45,370
there's so many things and you feel

193
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:46,479
burdened by what you can't do and how

194
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,459
you can't fix it

195
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,420
so the rest of the talk is all about the

196
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:54,369
things that you can do so let's talk

197
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,199
about some things and everybody has

198
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,750
different abilities so I tried to hit a

199
00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:00,819
broad stroke of things that you can do

200
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,000
depending on the time that you have and

201
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:07,300
your abilities and what your interest

202
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,980
might be so there's mentoring there's

203
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,260
a number of groups that you can actually

204
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,390
be a mentor for there's chick tech

205
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,279
there's black girls code there's a

206
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:19,360
number of different organizations so

207
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:23,649
make sure that not make sure attempt to

208
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,170
get out of your comfort zone and mentor

209
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:28,630
someone who isn't like you that's gonna

210
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,240
give you that sense of appreciation for

211
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,640
walking in their shoes and understanding

212
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,350
some of the challenges that other people

213
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,540
have that are different from the

214
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,180
challenges that you have we all have

215
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,510
challenges but it's good if you start to

216
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:47,739
think about what everybody else is doing

217
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:49,930
there's also volunteering so there are

218
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,640
schools that are title one schools does

219
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:57,339
anybody know what a title one school is

220
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,279
okay so typically a title one school is

221
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:02,649
a school that most of the kid there's a

222
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:06,279
large percentage of the population where

223
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:09,490
the the kids are or their households are

224
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:12,610
at poverty level below around there's

225
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,040
like this band there and so they get

226
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,750
government funding with that they have

227
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,079
different programs that come in like the

228
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:22,209
Sun program the Sun program is always

229
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,760
looking for people who can come in and

230
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:28,270
help them so if you're part of a network

231
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:31,079
one thing that is super rad and you are

232
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:33,579
giving kids who wouldn't normally like

233
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,829
bangin things around who wouldn't

234
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:39,939
normally have the opportunity to have

235
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:43,180
access to what we do in the InfoSec

236
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,010
world is let's say you have ten people

237
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,899
in your group and they all have slightly

238
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,170
different things that they love and that

239
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:53,170
they have as skillsets

240
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:56,439
you can have once a month go in to the

241
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:58,870
school and you can teach a class nothing

242
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,850
naughty but you can teach a class to

243
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,670
these kids and get them interested in

244
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,560
what is going on and that's something

245
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,829
that you can do just from a volunteer

246
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:13,209
perspective then you have open source

247
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:14,349
projects so sneakers again raise your

248
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:18,880
hand how many people who've seen

249
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:19,150
sneakers awesome so in sneakers who is

250
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,220
the

251
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,890
person who identified where the key was

252
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:28,890
to break the cryptographic code shout it

253
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:34,710
out if you remember the name Whistler

254
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:38,470
what was interesting about Whistler yes

255
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:41,250
so there's a thing called V Pat and what

256
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:44,920
that is is that as a bunch of code and

257
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:47,260
regulations to make things available for

258
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,770
site readers so that you have keystrokes

259
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:53,230
for gooeys etc so think about it if the

260
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,689
team did not have Whistler they couldn't

261
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,120
have found the key so you need people

262
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,860
with different abilities so think about

263
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,170
some of your open-source projects that

264
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,900
you use that you love that you are part

265
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:09,430
of every day and see if you can start to

266
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:12,240
integrate some of that code into it when

267
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:16,870
all else fails you can donate money

268
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:19,210
besides they have free tickets but it is

269
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,090
not free for people who to be here this

270
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:24,100
space is not free so giving money on a

271
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,950
regular basis you're allowing people to

272
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,850
continue to come and network you have

273
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:32,800
people who have donation programs and

274
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,800
they have people who are underprivileged

275
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,170
that can't go and donate can't go and

276
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,959
network and so if you donate money to

277
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:46,870
those conferences then they get the

278
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:50,790
opportunity to network networking see

279
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:53,260
how it all flowed it's like I planned it

280
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,030
so with networking networking can be

281
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,490
super scary so what I would encourage

282
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:00,100
you to do is to be the Kevlar vest for

283
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,720
people so if you have someone who's a

284
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,300
little nervous about it maybe they

285
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,730
haven't networked because they feel

286
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,630
different they feel odd so be that

287
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,640
Kevlar vest

288
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:13,300
let them know that it's safe create a

289
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,280
safe space for them the other thing that

290
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,979
you can do is you can help people who

291
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,439
have been hired to feel comfortable and

292
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:23,260
hurt I think this is the only example

293
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,990
I'm going to use Kate in and just her

294
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,590
name so how many people have been in a

295
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,470
room where you have someone like Kate

296
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:32,610
who has said hey I

297
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:37,260
I think a great way to solve this

298
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:39,390
problem is if we did x y&z crickets Fred

299
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,460
over here goes you don't be awesome what

300
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:44,250
if we did XY and Z and it was like wow

301
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,500
that's amazing Thank You Fred that is

302
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,900
the coolest idea I've ever heard and

303
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,990
you're sitting there going Kate Kate

304
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,990
just said that and a lot of times you're

305
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:57,900
like not sure what to say or do in that

306
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:00,660
scenario so one thing that you can do is

307
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,280
go Fred that sounds like a great idea

308
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,339
and it sounds like everyone just like

309
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:08,400
plus one Kate's idea which was what you

310
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,560
just said so I wonder how can we think

311
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,480
about moving that forward Kate do you

312
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,160
have any ideas for that and if you don't

313
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,630
you know what that's totally fine let's

314
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,060
figure out how we can all do that

315
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,860
together so you're taking it back and

316
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,569
you're bringing it back to Kate without

317
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,100
calling her out and making her feel like

318
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,890
oh my god someone just called me out

319
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,840
which could be a deterrent for her to

320
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,030
throw ideas out in the future you're

321
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:34,500
making it a positive experience for Kate

322
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:36,930
to speak up next follow people who

323
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,390
aren't like you on social media and

324
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,569
stand in when they're being harassed how

325
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:43,949
often does this happen that you see

326
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,750
people who are being harassed and you're

327
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,240
like oh my god they have to deal with

328
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:52,050
this on a regular basis you know what it

329
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,270
sucks but here's the thing having a man

330
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,099
go up against a man is far more

331
00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:00,480
impactful than a woman continuing to

332
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:02,640
fight 20 men far more impactful follow

333
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,490
them understand what the challenges are

334
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,470
use their same language but let them

335
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,080
know that you're doing it for the

336
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:13,020
purposes so that they don't have to take

337
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:16,770
that emotional hit to do it themselves

338
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,480
so be that Kevlar vest for them having a

339
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,260
white person go up against another white

340
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,970
person also far more impactful and

341
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,160
you're doing again that same thing where

342
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:29,190
you're taking the hit so that they don't

343
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,010
have to think about how it is to be in

344
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,230
their shoes and how exhausting it is

345
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:37,290
every single day to have to defend

346
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:41,310
yourself and to have to say what I'm

347
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:44,240
doing is okay and I should be able to

348
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,239
have this opinion

349
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:49,859
and we don't have Wi-Fi this would have

350
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:53,610
been a much cooler slide it would have

351
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:56,249
showed you that from my perspective if

352
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,920
we all look the same if we were all the

353
00:15:56,249 --> 00:16:01,739
same we'd get tired of looking at each

354
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,959
other it's actually song quote but I

355
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:05,850
really believe that we get tired of

356
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:08,609
looking at each other there's actually

357
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:11,819
this amazing site where you can actually

358
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:14,249
get stock photos absolutely free for

359
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:17,519
calling out women of color and textured

360
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:19,259
and so you can start to have that as a

361
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,480
subtle thing in the background as you're

362
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:25,339
doing your talks and they have all the

363
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:29,369
stock photos of a wide variety of people

364
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:32,610
who are in conference room meetings who

365
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:34,709
are white boarding stuff who are giving

366
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:38,160
presentations who come from all

367
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:39,959
different backgrounds use it have it in

368
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,839
your background it doesn't always have

369
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:49,279
to be I don't know he-man or cat photos

370
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:49,279
so speaking of

371
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,239
you
