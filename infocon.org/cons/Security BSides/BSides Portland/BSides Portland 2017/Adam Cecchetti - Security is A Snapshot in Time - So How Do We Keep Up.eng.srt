1
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,190
so thank you for the introduction thank

2
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,570
you for all spent for all of you

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,060
spending a bit of time with me here

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,580
today very briefly I'm Adam cicchetti

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,140
founder CEO of daijobu security also the

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,788
founder and chairman of peach fuzzer

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,230
which is the company we rolled out to do

8
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,529
the product is Asian of the peach fuzz

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,180
in framework which is open-source very

10
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,770
briefly about daijobu security where

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,540
seattle-based company we've been

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,370
operating since 2010 we've done hundreds

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,589
of application and hardware penetration

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,030
assessments specifically in the areas of

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:51,539
web crypto crypto currencies IOT and

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:53,610
infrastructure time is undefeated no

17
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,770
matter how fast you make your processes

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,870
no matter how much you reduce your gait

19
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,789
delay no matter how much you've time you

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,370
spend on making something more efficient

21
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,530
time is the finite resource which you

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,750
never get more of the wall clock keeps

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,439
on ticking and there's nothing that you

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,439
can do to stop it

25
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,860
timer roads all things

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,340
what was once state of the art or the

27
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,299
state of defense the pinnacle of

28
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,880
technology from whether you're looking

29
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,990
at it from a offensive or defensive

30
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,330
perspective if you add a little bit of

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,310
time to it it'll roads and eventually

32
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,810
becomes a ruin and this is no different

33
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,810
for the systems that we look at today

34
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:39,090
recently I've been getting kind of a

35
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:40,560
sense of deja vu if you rewind 20 years

36
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,150
so here a lot of people that will start

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,290
to say the tubes are on fire we have a

38
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,329
problem with the networks I mean just

39
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,799
secure our networks to rewind 15 years

40
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,809
ago that we talked about applications

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,640
whether it was desktop applications

42
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,990
server applications saying the desktops

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,630
are on fire we need to secure these

44
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,640
things 10 years ago it was the web the

45
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,070
entire world is on fire as we start to

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,899
plug more things in five years ago was

47
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,210
the cloud and recently with the Internet

48
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,130
of Things our pants are on fire and when

49
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,658
I originally wrote this slide was like

50
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,098
maybe that's a bit of a stretch and then

51
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,200
Samsung went ahead and made a phone that

52
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,959
exploded in your pocket so

53
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,910
I was like all right so maybe my

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,319
epiphany here is not so far-fetched

55
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:22,019
Thank You Samsung so the problem is big

56
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,970
the first step to recovery is always the

57
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:27,030
hardest but awareness doesn't cure

58
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,980
cancer obviously as we create more

59
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,540
systems and time continues to go on we

60
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,630
have some of the same problems over and

61
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,429
over again the cool thing about this is

62
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,709
though is that if you're an attacker

63
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,420
you can't just gin up a security problem

64
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,160
in someone else's system you have to

65
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,260
find the problem it has to exist there

66
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,329
already the individuals that built the

67
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,040
system have to have created it at some

68
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,200
point you cannot create a security

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,400
problem in someone else's system which

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,660
gives it these very interesting

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,340
properties that means the number of

72
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,160
security vulnerabilities out there is

73
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,599
finite now that's not to be saying that

74
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,670
new systems aren't being built every day

75
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,679
and constructed however at the same time

76
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,010
that gives them some very interesting

77
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,299
properties security issues are inherited

78
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,040
computers are very good at copying

79
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:09,569
things well the security problem from

80
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,280
one library to the next one that what

81
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:12,988
configuration to the next is no

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,670
different here it's very easy to get a

83
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,170
security problem being inherited from

84
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,700
one system to the next like a bad

85
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,670
fruitcake being passed from one relative

86
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,649
down on to the other they're plentiful

87
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,328
the fence helps and but for the last 20

88
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,980
years we've been doing mostly as a

89
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,420
research community kicking over more

90
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,518
rocks saying there's more problems in

91
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,048
more places and we're finding more

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,470
things faster than we have the ability

93
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:36,239
in many cases to kind of keep up they're

94
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,709
random the future is asymmetrically

95
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,630
secure we've gotten very good at

96
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,459
securing certain kinds of systems

97
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,530
operating systems browsers and certain

98
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,299
other pieces but you start to add the

99
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,739
web Internet of Things and cloud and

100
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,709
that we start have to start this process

101
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,540
all over again and finally there

102
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,639
polymorphic the tools that we use to

103
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,138
construct our systems eventually become

104
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,900
security problems themselves

105
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:00,090
JTAG being a debug a debugger but also

106
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,970
potentially a backdoor and other logging

107
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,319
and infrastructure become the same thing

108
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,030
so if we want to fix this problem at

109
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,339
scale we're gonna have to start thinking

110
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,510
a little bit differently and there's

111
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,400
occasionally this idea that we should

112
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,260
just give up and monitor and mitigate

113
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,349
everything that there is absolutely no

114
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,820
possible way for us to ever keep an

115
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:20,190
attacker out of a system or make

116
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,570
defensible systems and I say we

117
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,000
shouldn't start thinking that way we

118
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,500
should can you think

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,790
and a bit differently but not so

120
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,290
differently that we throw in the towel

121
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:32,540
so let's take a look at the last sixty

122
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,820
years or so of computer systems

123
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,560
somewhere around the 70s we took a whole

124
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,570
bunch of hard copy and shoved it into

125
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,250
mainframes effectively taking

126
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,380
distributed data from multiple sources

127
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,600
and putting it into a centralized system

128
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,550
shortly after that we started to push

129
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,950
this data out into individual pcs

130
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,510
through the 80s into the 90s back into

131
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,520
web and email resent realizing it

132
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,500
reproach distributing out through social

133
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,960
networks resent realizing it into the

134
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,910
cloud and redistributing it currently

135
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,320
into the Internet of Things so if you

136
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,030
look at this cadence if you look at this

137
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,830
clock about every 10 years we kind of

138
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,840
have this pulse of we put either

139
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,700
centralized or decentralized the data in

140
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,890
different places and along with it

141
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,680
follows the users users use dumb

142
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:16,490
terminals on mainframes the PCs to email

143
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,740
and the way that their actions happen

144
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,810
creates new data and some of that data

145
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,730
lingers in the Eddie's and places of

146
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:28,610
where it's left over from previous usage

147
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:32,120
models security in effect is a snapshot

148
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,400
in time the snapshot in time is that

149
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,020
snapshot where the system designers and

150
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,400
where the system builders decided to

151
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,260
make it so you take a set of libraries

152
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,969
you put it into some binaries you put it

153
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,030
on a set of systems you push it out and

154
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:46,970
that snapshot can be very easy to end up

155
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,919
in not where you're currently at so

156
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,360
there's a very interesting point along

157
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:55,250
that graph which is around 1995 in 1995

158
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,130
attackers are effectively unstoppable

159
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,169
the closer the snapshot to 1995 the

160
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,520
harder it is to defend so let's talk

161
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:04,460
about that for a second

162
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,250
in 1995 there was absolutely no memory

163
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,450
defenses like DEP ASLR stack cookies or

164
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,970
some of the other things we kind of take

165
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,349
for granted today there was no patching

166
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,990
and the patching that was out there was

167
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,000
focused on reliability and availability

168
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,220
not security issues there was little to

169
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,140
no security awareness and there was the

170
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,910
default scope or the default attack

171
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,770
surface installed for every single

172
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:27,169
system that you would propagate out so

173
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,400
you would set up a new you know PC you

174
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:30,680
set up a new server and you will get

175
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,320
everything turned on by default so the

176
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,440
closer the clock looks like what we did

177
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,210
in 1995 the harder it is to defend

178
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,680
which effectively means if you're trying

179
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,270
to defend systems that have a snapshot

180
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,980
that looks like 95 you're going up

181
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,460
against terminators there's not really a

182
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:48,290
good chance of you winning put slightly

183
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,169
different you wouldn't March this army

184
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,090
today you would not take rifle rifle men

185
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,010
in close order formation onto a field of

186
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,479
battle and expect good results the

187
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,940
second they came up against modern

188
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,200
attack it would be immediately decimated

189
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:04,640
by automatic or mid wear heavy weapons

190
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,820
very similarly you wouldn't March this

191
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,289
army in 21 17 not to say the brave men

192
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,330
and women of our armed forces don't do

193
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,220
an incredible job there's just too much

194
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,840
time for them to catch up on there's too

195
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,550
many things that have changed their

196
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,020
attack model their defense model was

197
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,840
done in the past so how do we get to

198
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,039
having systems shipping in 2017 that

199
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,440
look like we're trying to defend them in

200
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,330
2002 here's an example of a recent

201
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,130
binary that we looked at that was

202
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,750
compiled and shipped in 2016

203
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,969
had a library the last time it was

204
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,070
touched or updated was from 2011 another

205
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,490
library from 2006 which had another

206
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,800
library baked into it from 2005 finally

207
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,810
the oldest piece of code inside of it

208
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,060
was from 2002 the last time someone

209
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,980
updated it so here's a modern binary

210
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,010
being compiled and shipped with modern

211
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:54,410
standards in 2016 and the point in time

212
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,960
which is trying to defend it as is

213
00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:00,580
actually in 2002 so there was

214
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,349
immediately a ton of bugs inside of it

215
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,960
so here's an example of going back all

216
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,610
the way to 1995 and 2017 here's a piece

217
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,830
of firmware we recently looked at it was

218
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,280
compiled in 2016 from a reference

219
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,560
implementation built in 2005 built on of

220
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,510
another piece of firmware from 2006

221
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,930
baked together from a library from tooth

222
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:23,150
to 2005 all built on protocols from 1995

223
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,980
this system is effectively indefensible

224
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,429
even though it's being shipped and

225
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:33,680
pushed out in 2007 16 because we're

226
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:35,120
looking at it from 1995 but enough doom

227
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,689
and gloom for a second let's talk about

228
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,340
how awesome computers are right

229
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,360
computers don't let you do anything they

230
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,490
do anything

231
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,990
modern touring machines are the reason

232
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,370
that we have a distributed global

233
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,230
network whose primary purpose is

234
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,769
delivers cats on small embedded devices

235
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:54,259
that is us

236
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:55,759
and general computation is good it

237
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:57,680
enabled a revolution in the way we

238
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,970
process information at the same time it

239
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,380
didn't come with some of the things that

240
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,829
we really decided along the way that we

241
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,990
needed

242
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:05,839
there's no reliability no availability

243
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,699
no security as a result we had to bolt

244
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,410
on multiple layers of complexity at

245
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:12,709
every single stage when we wanted one of

246
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,660
these things the more complexity the

247
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:17,119
more opportunities for an attacker to

248
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,589
find an issue the more opportunities for

249
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,120
an attacker to find an issue the more

250
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:21,610
possibility of a side effect in the

251
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,839
system that wasn't predicted

252
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,329
exploitation whether you're writing a

253
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,759
modern exploit or a mic slick from 1995

254
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:30,800
is simply stacking up side effects in a

255
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,329
programmatic matter exploitation is

256
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,790
programming with side effects set a

257
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:36,380
little bit simpler but don't get me

258
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,849
wrong the side effects are awesome they

259
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,290
manifest themselves in all kinds of

260
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,850
interesting ways and we have conferences

261
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,069
like this and all around the world to

262
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,230
sit down and sometimes literally discuss

263
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:46,880
one individual side effect in one system

264
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:51,649
and how interesting that is from us in a

265
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,569
general computation standpoint we're at

266
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:56,329
this very interesting and odd juncture

267
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:58,339
mobile Zita world the same way that PC

268
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:00,229
did user habits are starting to shift

269
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:02,240
again we're putting producing and

270
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,130
consuming data in a distributed manner

271
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,110
for the things that aren't on your

272
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,759
mobile phone the web ate the rest of the

273
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,110
world in API manner which meant

274
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,300
everything at this point is becoming

275
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,069
distributed as a result we have these

276
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,449
very strange pockets where user data

277
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:17,899
flows and kind of lingers into the

278
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:19,250
eddies in different places for those of

279
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:21,079
us that still care about general

280
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,790
computation we're left to run unknown

281
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,019
kernel and firmware exploits on our

282
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,599
phone so we can actually use as a

283
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:28,250
general Turing machine again effectively

284
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,110
jailbreaking the thing and blowing a

285
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,569
hole in the only security the mobile

286
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:38,180
device provides us which is do not run

287
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:41,389
unsigned untrusted code occasionally it

288
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,829
kind of pops up into the meme meme verse

289
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:44,899
of the ecosystem that we should stop

290
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:46,579
putting things on the internet and my

291
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,959
response to this is is you should stop

292
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,630
telling water to be wet because you'll

293
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:52,310
have better luck with that it is free to

294
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,870
put another computer on the Internet it

295
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,609
costs you nothing to add another device

296
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,189
to a corporate network or a home network

297
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:01,069
and to a certain point to a certain

298
00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:02,610
threshold it is free to put a Pentium

299
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:04,680
Pro inside of literally any

300
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:08,220
we can put a Pentium Pro and a mop today

301
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,380
and it costs us $0 in four years it is

302
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,779
free to put an iPhone one and literally

303
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:16,260
everything and why is this it's because

304
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,550
of the inverse of Moore's Law everyone

305
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,470
its rim is very familiar with Moore's

306
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,849
law Moore's law very simply states that

307
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,190
every 18 months the number of

308
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,860
transistors doubles and we get general

309
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,990
computation allowing us to revolutionize

310
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,010
the world to have the fast CPU so we can

311
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,880
deliver cats through our faces

312
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:34,319
instantaneously today however this may

313
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,870
have created this industry but the

314
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,149
inverse of Moore's law is that every 18

315
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,790
months the cost of a transistor halves

316
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:44,880
in the inverse of Moore's laws what is

317
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:46,140
going to change the face of the earth so

318
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,200
if we take a look at the number of

319
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,689
transistors in a Pentium Pro in 1995

320
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,670
that cost 1,000 u.s. dollars and you

321
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:56,279
apply the inverse of Moore's law to it

322
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,740
putting a Pentium Pro in every single

323
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,920
thing is free today and every day in the

324
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,920
future

325
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:07,260
putting an iPhone in everything in the

326
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,180
near future or adding a first generation

327
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,140
worth of iPhone transistors to

328
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,989
absolutely everything is $4 and 2018 and

329
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:19,319
free in 2022 if you want to put that

330
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:22,829
slightly differently adding Wi-Fi GSM

331
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,230
Bluetooth GPU CPU storage sound and an

332
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:29,640
interface is free for every single

333
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:31,440
device in 2022 it costs literally the

334
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,910
engineering time because the transistor

335
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,540
cost is free at that point which is

336
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,360
awesome

337
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,500
the internet finally showed up the thing

338
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,449
we've been waiting for the thing that

339
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,519
got us into this like the cyberpunk

340
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:46,589
future is finally here I think that is

341
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,329
amazing that means the amount of air gap

342
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:49,920
between our lives every single day is

343
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:51,689
shrinking a little bit more and more and

344
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,829
frankly I'm ready let's go like plug me

345
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:57,360
in with its matrix time unless of course

346
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:58,890
you decide to try and live entirely

347
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,540
offline and you know at a certain point

348
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,279
the transistors become so cheap you can

349
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,459
put them in back 1 oh but regardlessly

350
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,320
can kind of move on from this idea so

351
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,420
technology in my opinion is awesome in

352
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,890
five years my self-driving car will have

353
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,510
an internet connection which means I can

354
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,360
livestream myself from inside of my

355
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,499
self-driving car which means that

356
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,759
localized people

357
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:19,199
ethics sitting around the world board

358
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,209
and trying to monetize their commute

359
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,919
will livestream their twitch stream or

360
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:24,238
coding streams to other people sitting

361
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,728
in traffic around the world bored just

362
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:28,049
wanting to watch someone else which

363
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:29,669
means we're gonna have people sitting in

364
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:31,079
traffic watching other people sitting in

365
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:33,359
traffic around the world because we

366
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,809
haven't figured out how to like do real

367
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:38,339
traffic yet which is awesome in my

368
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:39,629
opinion you'll end up having like all

369
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,159
kinds of entertaining rigs and

370
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:43,559
self-driving vehicles to allow you to

371
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,609
kind of do this and being live from you

372
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:46,769
know whatever parking lot you're

373
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:51,419
currently on whether it's i-5 or 420 or

374
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:52,919
whatever might be so good and bad

375
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:54,329
because we got some of the other things

376
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,209
kind of coming up something I call the

377
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:58,439
Internet of me I can't wait I can

378
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:01,589
actually wait a minute until my heart

379
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:04,199
has an IP address because it's gonna

380
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:05,399
need firmware updates and of course you

381
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:07,169
need to you know have an app store to

382
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,459
monetize the fact we have IP addressable

383
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:10,439
organs you want to make sure that you

384
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,819
know we can get you know the developer

385
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:14,728
community involved in third-party apps

386
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:15,929
pushed here so you know there's a big

387
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,309
health kick going on which means you'll

388
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:18,689
have your cardio trainer and you want to

389
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:20,039
make sure that you can live update to

390
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:21,478
Twitter or Instagram or whatever the

391
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,979
thing will be in a couple of years and

392
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:24,419
of course those applications will need

393
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:25,919
patched and they will have side effects

394
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:28,978
inside of the systems that are inside of

395
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,659
you move brat move fast and break things

396
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:32,909
for IP addressable organs is not

397
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:36,419
something I want I need to figure this

398
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:38,189
one out get this one right that brings

399
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:41,069
up this interesting concept is which

400
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:43,108
everybody bugs bugs happen to the best

401
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:44,909
and worst there's bugs in some of the

402
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:46,470
most robust systems in the world and

403
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:48,659
frankly it's because they're proof that

404
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,759
you did something the world moves

405
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:52,109
forward one little mistake at a time one

406
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:57,029
more thing plugged into the Internet at

407
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:59,159
a time so how do we talk about this to

408
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,929
people that are the folks that make the

409
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,729
decisions about these things how do we

410
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:04,559
make them understand or help them

411
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:05,789
understand to take the snapshot in a

412
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,059
better ways such that they care about

413
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:11,220
security well the fastest way to lose

414
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:14,218
normal deep people is to start with

415
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,359
details the buffer can overflow causing

416
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:16,859
a corruption the pointer which interns

417
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:18,389
referenced by the vtable to cause code

418
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:19,949
to jump to a known locations or a little

419
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:22,439
SLR being compounded to the supporting

420
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:26,128
dll this room knows what I'm talking

421
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:27,748
about maybe a third of you care the

422
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:29,550
password is password everyone in this

423
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:33,060
room knows what I'm talking about

424
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:35,130
no you really care a user can affect the

425
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,449
details of user B that's when you start

426
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,920
to get people to care what do you mean

427
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,360
you can go into my virtual farm and

428
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,550
still my virtual sheep I don't want that

429
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,700
I mean I really don't like I spent a lot

430
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,260
of time on that virtual farm and

431
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,610
sometimes the details really truly don't

432
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,959
matter there's certain things that get

433
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,820
published there's certain embedded

434
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,109
systems there's certain bugs that no

435
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,480
matter how much you talk about the

436
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,550
details the impact upon our daily lives

437
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,720
is negligible so starting there is a

438
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:02,130
road to basically a dead end so how will

439
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,630
we as an industry been getting things

440
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,370
flowing how have we been talking about

441
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,870
this in a certain way that people can

442
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:11,220
understand us well we talk about impact

443
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:14,370
the users bank account can be drained

444
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,380
one user cares the company can no longer

445
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,019
perform transaction the entire company

446
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,800
cares the car performs a j-turn at 60

447
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,100
miles an hour

448
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,529
remotely you get a news cycle the plane

449
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,760
crashes you get two news cycles for if

450
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:32,730
they can't find the plane the pacemaker

451
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,589
stops and kills somebody two federal

452
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,020
agencies and an n number of pacemaker

453
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:38,490
users really care everybody else goes I

454
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,060
don't have a pacemaker but that sounds

455
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,700
terrible

456
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,609
what else is in the next Channel the

457
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,050
power plant explodes that's interesting

458
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,130
that someone else did it but when did

459
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,630
the lights come back on because that's

460
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,220
what I really care about I really care

461
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,750
about you know that's a nice you lost

462
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:55,709
the power plant when can I turn my

463
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:57,089
toaster back on with an age of infinite

464
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,310
scroll this problems been exacerbated

465
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:00,959
because now there's infinite information

466
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,589
and infinite other things to take a look

467
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,760
to understand to see impacts from

468
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:08,250
Charlie Miller and Chris valasek did

469
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,260
some fantastic work hacking the Jeep two

470
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,419
years ago absolutely phenomenal work

471
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,069
this is a follow-up article by Alan

472
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:17,730
Greenspan the same person that did that

473
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:19,260
kind of the initial press on it doing a

474
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,179
survey of the individuals that had heard

475
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,010
about this saying that only one in four

476
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,990
Americans that had heard about the fact

477
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:28,319
that a car could be hacked remembered it

478
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:31,050
one year later that is fantastic

479
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,760
information to me going the thing that

480
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,918
all the people heard could be hacked as

481
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,780
a 3,000 pound piece of steel throwing

482
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,700
down the road at 60 miles an hour can be

483
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,960
suddenly taken over only about one

484
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,610
fourth of those folks really oh yeah

485
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,230
that's probably gonna that's bad

486
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,699
great

487
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,470
so I mean it takes a second for that to

488
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,059
kind of catch up the impact

489
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:52,169
only has a splash of a certain duration

490
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,970
so I'd like to talk about a concept

491
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:56,519
called Ken for those of you that are

492
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,830
nautical individuals in the organ so you

493
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,659
may have heard of this word before Ken's

494
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,059
a very old word it has Germanic roots

495
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:04,980
and etymology of it is effectively the

496
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:07,408
range of one's sites or one's knowledge

497
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:11,610
it's how far you can see it's found how

498
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:13,679
far you understand something and and for

499
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,360
your Ken how far or wide your

500
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,620
individually focused and additionally

501
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,379
when you're talking about someone else

502
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:23,580
how far and wide or narrow they can see

503
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,929
and where the what they can focus on so

504
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,699
here's a common picture that has

505
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:28,230
multiple revealing layers depending on

506
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,950
how you focus on it and where it's at

507
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,809
this is not ken ken is understanding

508
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,600
that you can only see half of this

509
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,830
picture that your range of vision that

510
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,149
your range of knowledge the way you

511
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,529
understand and see the world whether

512
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:43,500
it's from a details and impact

513
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:45,090
perspectives only so wide and that when

514
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,679
you have someone else that you're

515
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,029
talking to whether it's your Ken in the

516
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,190
audience or someone else you're speaking

517
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:53,519
about it's the exact same thing they can

518
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,289
only see part of the picture but with

519
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,840
our Ken together we can start to see a

520
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:59,460
more full picture what reveals multiple

521
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,199
things multiple layers multiple

522
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,080
different nuances between the two pieces

523
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,190
combined so let's get a little more

524
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,379
concrete example there Ken I need to

525
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,799
move 14,000 plains a day with 300 people

526
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:18,450
in them each or the global economy stops

527
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:19,950
full stop my Ken planes can crash or

528
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,409
move in ways that you don't intend if

529
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,990
you wire them to the Internet there can

530
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:29,760
customers really don't like to crash my

531
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:31,440
can is less planes move if they crash so

532
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,789
how about our combined Ken together is

533
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,960
let's make planes that are better and

534
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:39,450
safer in the future we've both learned

535
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,860
something if you look back at this it's

536
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,380
very often that someone will start with

537
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,918
their own details 14,000 planes

538
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,870
300 people my details they might move in

539
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:51,090
ways that you don't intent the impact

540
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,830
crash the thing that we care about that

541
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,449
with our ken together we can get to a

542
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,168
common ground a common place of

543
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,519
interface as a result

544
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:00,009
and both be kind of left thinking for a

545
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:04,659
second like wait a second I think we can

546
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:06,460
figure out how to work together ken is

547
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:08,080
always accepting we is greater than I

548
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,609
that by having someone else that you

549
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,678
interface having someone else that you

550
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,908
interface talk with about the range of

551
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,470
your knowledge and the range of their

552
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:16,659
knowledge that the two of you or the

553
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,309
multiple of you together

554
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:22,299
have an extended range of just one of

555
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:23,678
you alone once you have an extended

556
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:25,539
range of vision you can start talking

557
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,100
about the impacts and then finally work

558
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:30,220
out the details that really matter to

559
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,779
the impacts so how do you know whether

560
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,769
or not you're starting to have Ken with

561
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:38,049
another individual

562
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:39,639
well you test for echo you have lost if

563
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:41,649
all you are hearing is your own words

564
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:43,149
coming back if you say something to

565
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:44,889
someone the password policy needs to be

566
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:46,029
updated so it's 14 characters long has a

567
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:47,799
special underscore and whether I'm like

568
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:49,149
yes absolutely that sounds 100% correct

569
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:50,590
a lot of a password policy it's 14

570
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:52,779
characters long underscore and special

571
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,820
characters and whatever they have not

572
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:56,139
understood or if what you're hearing

573
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,200
back is something you already know

574
00:20:56,139 --> 00:21:00,820
you haven't extended yourself shared ken

575
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,499
is a shared exchange of knowledge and a

576
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,668
shared range in part it's actually

577
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:04,960
shared vulnerability because you're

578
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:06,700
literally pointing out someone I'm

579
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,619
trying to understand what you're saying

580
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,340
I need you to help me to see the place

581
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:14,470
that I cannot see when this doesn't

582
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,850
occur you have a sustained echo between

583
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,259
two organizations you have the same

584
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,879
information either being passed back and

585
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:20,049
forth or you have the same individual

586
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:21,879
saying the same things to each other

587
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:23,200
which is a fast construction of an echo

588
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:25,209
chamber and no one eventually learns

589
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,499
anything actually everyone synchronizes

590
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,389
on the same message agrees that the

591
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:30,190
policy should be this and we will do

592
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:32,320
that but nobody really has a way of

593
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:34,359
extending themselves on a decade

594
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,100
timeline in any large community this is

595
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,570
a slow death because you have no new

596
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,039
influences to be able to start to

597
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:43,779
understand the problem in the domain and

598
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,519
you do affect have an effect on so don't

599
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:48,639
take my word for it let's take a look at

600
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,409
three times that we want our three big

601
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:53,139
winds were firewalls encryption and

602
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:56,080
two-factor off these are all three

603
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:57,729
examples of an extension of Ken I don't

604
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,649
want to run Ethernet cable in my house

605
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,940
well how about a Wi-Fi network what if

606
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:03,399
it just happens to have an added

607
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,509
firewall with it here's a firewall into

608
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:06,479
your home where you have something that

609
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:08,919
makes your life a little bit better

610
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,730
encryption I can't make it to the store

611
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:11,530
today I want to work

612
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,390
from home well how about this tunnel it

613
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,220
happens to go over TLS and SSL or it

614
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,330
goes over encrypted IPSec tunnel don't

615
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,770
worry about those details we have

616
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,120
hundreds of smart people that sit in

617
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,280
rooms on weekends to listen to people

618
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,159
talk so we can make sure that that works

619
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,350
but how would you like to shop from home

620
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,200
sounds good right or how would you like

621
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,240
to work from home two-factor

622
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,830
authentication the first mass adoption

623
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,530
of two-factor authentication was in the

624
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,899
world World of Warcraft from MMORPG

625
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,910
because people didn't want to rewind the

626
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,320
character they had spent 40 hours a week

627
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,750
of their spare time putting back

628
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:48,399
together so thank you

629
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:50,440
gamers so what does that mean we've won

630
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,090
the same way that everyone else has we

631
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,860
have won when we've made someone's life

632
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,449
better when we truly understood what the

633
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,159
thing that was impactful in their lives

634
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,500
or their organization where they were

635
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,090
spending their time and then saying hey

636
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,250
here's a better way to do it just

637
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,480
happens to be secure ignore that and

638
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,250
we'll just kind of sweep under the rug

639
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,660
that we just Trojan horse security into

640
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:12,550
your life if you can shift the user

641
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,020
behavior to something that's better and

642
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,430
simpler and is something that you've

643
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,110
been talking about trying to build as

644
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,700
part of the future for a long time they

645
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,320
will immediately adopt it it happens

646
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,940
like wildfire look at this thing better

647
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,120
faster I can get a package to my house

648
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,280
in 24 hours I can get you know I can do

649
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,939
my online transactions here no problem I

650
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,740
don't even have to go into the bank the

651
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,660
users will always want to do the thing

652
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,920
if you truly understand the user of the

653
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,870
organization that wants to do the thing

654
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:43,360
that can starts to follow up pretty fast

655
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:44,530
so how do we keep up as we keep up with

656
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,719
three different things

657
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:51,370
details impact and Kent the details are

658
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,780
very simple it's what everyone in this

659
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,820
room has been doing for a very long time

660
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,230
it requires a ridiculous amount of work

661
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:57,850
to understand all the nitty-gritty

662
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,410
pieces of a different of the systems

663
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,070
understand where and how they're

664
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,350
vulnerable

665
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:04,000
however I will help posit to you I make

666
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,520
this hypothesis that there are only four

667
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,880
security bugs and all systems that we

668
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,889
have ever constructed the first bug is

669
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,690
data being interpreted as code this is

670
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,310
SQL injection cross-site scripting

671
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,750
buffer overflows and a significant

672
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:19,030
number of memory corruption bugs fall

673
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,590
into this category take some data the

674
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,690
system starts to interpret that data

675
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,530
it eventually interprets that as code it

676
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,530
jumps to a certain

677
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,730
and any place that the Machine can take

678
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,350
some data parse it and potentially

679
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,840
interpret it as code their security

680
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,060
problem waits we have spent a ridiculous

681
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,770
amount of time here looking at this and

682
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,530
they can you can spend entire lifetimes

683
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,930
mastering just this bug and people have

684
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,910
they spent entire careers on one of

685
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:45,040
these bugs or a multiple two of these

686
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,450
bugs and so as a result we've made some

687
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,460
pretty good gains here we have things

688
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,050
like DEP and a SLR and stacked cookies

689
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,820
and static analyzers and dynamic

690
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:55,540
analyzers and fuzzers we've done some

691
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:57,340
pretty good work here the second bug is

692
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,260
that gamers are always going to came and

693
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,090
my first bug it's that data is being

694
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,590
interpreted as code and the second bug

695
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,300
it's that the logic of the program is

696
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,500
not being executed is intended you're

697
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,080
taking a different flow through the

698
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,700
program we haven't made a lot of good

699
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,990
progress here in automating these types

700
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,780
of systems to be able to make logical

701
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:15,730
checks for every condition additionally

702
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,379
there's also the metagame

703
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:20,410
which is pushing the clock back as close

704
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,750
as you possibly can in 1995 by finding

705
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,220
the weakest place in the graph attackers

706
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,600
will always go after the weakest point

707
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,640
and the weakest point will be at

708
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,199
whatever in your infrastructure programs

709
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,880
systems whatever it is that looks

710
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,570
closest to 1995

711
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,150
unless the motivation versus reward

712
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:39,970
scenario is incredibly high saying I

713
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:41,980
want a bug in modern iOS 11 or I want a

714
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,570
bug and Chrome and there's a significant

715
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,860
amount of money or motivation behind

716
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,510
having that bug either from an

717
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,969
organization perspective or politicals

718
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:50,260
perspective it doesn't matter only in

719
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,360
the cases where the reward scenario is

720
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,770
that high will they not go for well an

721
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:58,179
attack or not go for the weakest point

722
00:25:53,770 --> 00:26:01,090
in time the next one is the secret isn't

723
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,850
secret from one has seen the password or

724
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:06,459
we all use the password password one

725
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:08,469
exclamation point and this is secured by

726
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,570
most modern policies that you'll see in

727
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,720
many IT organizations and many websites

728
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,939
that you go to a more secure password by

729
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,380
a stronger policy of 16 characters

730
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:21,040
special upper or lower case is actually

731
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:22,870
an SQL injection vector have or one

732
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,060
equals one and it is can it is

733
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,760
absolutely a valid password by many

734
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,379
modern policies if we're not passing

735
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,360
around word jumbles to each other we're

736
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,100
passing around bits that we may or may

737
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,350
not be able to verify we're entropically

738
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,500
created on one machine send them to

739
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,000
another machine

740
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,530
to have them may or may not correctly

741
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,580
entropically verify and use that for

742
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,530
another operation

743
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,760
many of our NGS and other things still

744
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,920
have a lot of work and we're finding a

745
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,420
lot of bugs even as recent as the infant

746
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,830
on bug and the last one is the thing is

747
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,870
in the wrong place and this usually

748
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:56,899
manifests itself isn't the following

749
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:59,030
what is this oh my god this should not

750
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,560
be here how did this get here whether

751
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,629
it's a system on the wrong side of the

752
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,540
DMZ or a person on the wrong side of a

753
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:07,370
physical security door the thing being

754
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,379
in the wrong place is often indefensible

755
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,389
because it's outside of the area you

756
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,350
were hoping to defend it if the system

757
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,440
that you're trying to build

758
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:21,590
looks like 1995 it's impossible to

759
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:23,000
defend it because it's not in 2017 so to

760
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,620
master impact you need to be able to

761
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,320
start to see the system as a graph the

762
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,790
list sorted by time this allows you to

763
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,470
understand what matters in the system

764
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,990
most and what you can cut out of the

765
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,700
system immediately at that point you can

766
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,560
start to use the details to break that

767
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,330
point in the system and when the system

768
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,000
will not break you change the game by

769
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:44,689
moving the clock so let's talk a little

770
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,850
bit about mastering the graph so when

771
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,920
you start to see the system of as a

772
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,969
graph and you start to label points in

773
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,070
this graph whether this is an

774
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,780
infrastructure graph a binary graph it

775
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,129
doesn't matter it's starting to

776
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,450
understand where pieces of this is being

777
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,970
constructed and what matters the most

778
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,010
you can start applying actions to then

779
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:04,760
update it to get more secure to move

780
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:06,379
more forward in time when you understand

781
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,240
what your organization cares about or

782
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,980
what you care about you can start to

783
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,510
actually spend time and resources in

784
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,070
places that deter the most amount of

785
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:15,920
attack or the most time of an attacker

786
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,300
because the attacker of your systems or

787
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,550
someone that's an offensive scenario

788
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,659
also has a limited amount of time and

789
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,909
resources that they can throw in

790
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,190
anything waste enough of their time

791
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,510
waste enough of their resources make it

792
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,490
such that what they're going after isn't

793
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,680
valuable to them or your organization

794
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:35,690
and you start to have real impact on

795
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:38,150
their ability to exploit them it's

796
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,770
master Ken eyes to know yourself and the

797
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,270
ideas and creations that you have put

798
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,820
into the world as well as the systems

799
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:45,679
that you care about the most it's asking

800
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:48,139
to understand yourself and others and

801
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,549
the impacts to then use to connect

802
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,129
yourself to other individuals and

803
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:53,720
organisation's faster at that point

804
00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:55,580
using the details to demonstrate the

805
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,590
issues in each of the systems if you

806
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,210
start with details you will always lose

807
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:03,769
the individuals that you're trying to

808
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:05,690
extend your can with the interesting

809
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:08,779
thing about Ken is is it as double-edged

810
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:10,429
sword in cooperation it allows you to

811
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:13,369
extend your knowledge and extend your

812
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:14,779
range and understanding in conflict it

813
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:17,418
allows you to immediately find where

814
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:19,669
your opponent is blind where they're

815
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:21,739
blind they cannot defend so if you want

816
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:23,600
the fastest way to go into a system the

817
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:25,429
fastest way to find a massive impact in

818
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,748
a system and you understand the can of

819
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:29,029
where someone else is blind and you

820
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:30,379
target that vulnerabilities immediately

821
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:37,609
fall out it doesn't matter about the

822
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:39,738
details at that point so I would ask you

823
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:41,989
to start testing for EKKO is to step out

824
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:43,159
of the echo chamber from time to time to

825
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:44,929
start going and talking to other

826
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:46,399
individuals either in your organization

827
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:47,989
or at other conferences other places

828
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,418
about some of the problems that they

829
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:52,220
have and just listen hear what they care

830
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:54,619
about and understand why it's important

831
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,989
to them such that you can go forward and

832
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:58,309
use that as some way to extend your own

833
00:29:56,989 --> 00:30:01,009
vision and knowledge and port it to

834
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:03,289
different places see how much you hear

835
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:04,340
back when you start see how much you

836
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:06,619
hear back when you start interacting

837
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,809
with them but most importantly see what

838
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:10,939
you didn't have any idea of previously

839
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:12,428
that little bump and your range of

840
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,139
knowledge and understanding is

841
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:20,029
invaluable for reapplying that to other

842
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:22,519
systems so how do we keep up security as

843
00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:24,139
a snapshot in time time is ever moving

844
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:25,549
forward well we keep up by understanding

845
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:27,350
the snapshot we need to take

846
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:28,639
understanding what the range of our can

847
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:30,259
is for the systems that we administer

848
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:33,080
are the systems that we look at defend

849
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:34,639
or attack understanding what the impacts

850
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,470
in that system are interesting so we

851
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:38,269
know how to spend our time and then

852
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,769
finally using the details of the system

853
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:43,759
to either break it or build a better

854
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:45,649
tomorrow building a better tomorrow and

855
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,539
ask them to help you adopt it is the

856
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:49,399
fastest way to defend old systems the

857
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:51,679
fast way to deprecate things make a new

858
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:53,600
user path make a simpler user path make

859
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,090
it more secure user path and it will be

860
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,580
adopted very simply do you want to keep

861
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:01,879
fighting and pulling yourself away from

862
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,679
1995 or start building the future if you

863
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:04,209
use 10

864
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,590
correctly if you talk to individuals in

865
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,910
your organisation correctly and you say

866
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,590
I want to build the future and I want to

867
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:13,600
make it awesome there's very little

868
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:16,120
friction to that most of the time so

869
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,770
takeaways security is a snapshot in time

870
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,540
the second you deploy a system it

871
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,550
immediately starts to erode it starts to

872
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,520
move backwards on you've towards 1995

873
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:26,680
that snapshot is part Ken impact in

874
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,170
details building a better tomorrow can

875
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,330
create a more secure tomorrow if we

876
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:33,180
point towards that and if we extend our

877
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,530
cannon to someone else's understanding

878
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,910
but it requires us to understand where

879
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,110
are we you're blind and not understand

880
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,770
other people in the organization's

881
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,969
ourselves

882
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:44,910
I hope this talk is extended yours

883
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:50,449
alright thank you

884
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:50,449
[Applause]

885
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,830
you
