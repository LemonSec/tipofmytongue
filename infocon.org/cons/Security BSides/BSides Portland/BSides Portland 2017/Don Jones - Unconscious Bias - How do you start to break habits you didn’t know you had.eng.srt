1
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:19,270
is how many of you have you're in a

2
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,980
relationship raise your hand how many of

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:23,380
you have been in stinky relationships

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,140
raise your hand I'm raising my hand

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,549
because I've been in one too so in

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,529
stinky relationships there are

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,270
interactions that happen stuff that goes

8
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,439
on things that are happen how many of

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,170
you are in a much better relationship

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,489
now you're a better person for you're a

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,059
lot easier to live with you're a lot

12
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:41,919
easier what happens with someone that

13
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:44,769
you're with in your good relationship

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,890
behaves or speaks in a way that reminds

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,289
you of your stinky relationship what's

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,300
your reaction it's visceral its

17
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:54,309
immediate and the person that you now

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,510
are with is saying what's going on I

19
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:57,248
don't understand what's happening here

20
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,300
why are you reacting this way and you

21
00:00:57,249 --> 00:01:04,059
have to explain this is for me beans you

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,830
will do X you will be this you do that

23
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:07,149
and if the person cares about you and

24
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,158
they care about they're gonna say oh I

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,510
got it okay so what do I need to do

26
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,340
differently what is it that we need to

27
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,799
know I need to learn this and I need to

28
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,500
find this out so for me this was a very

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,960
clear journey because I'm talking about

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,600
something that happened to me 28 years

31
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,669
ago where I was in a really stinky

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,380
relationship all kind of goofy stuff

33
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,030
happened you know how relationships go I

34
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,030
go into a new relationship the person

35
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm still with now and I had to figure

36
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:37,210
out Who am I what is it about me that

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,340
makes me who I am that I care and that I

38
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,320
want to be for this person who cares

39
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,900
about me and understands me very well so

40
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,149
for me that was a journey into what are

41
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,090
the unconscious things that I'm carrying

42
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:51,880
from my experience with that stinky

43
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,940
person that I now have that are could

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,920
ruin my current relationship so that's a

45
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,350
small example of an unconscious a

46
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,730
learned thing right and I think it's

47
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,880
really important for us to think about

48
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:05,310
these types of mundane things because we

49
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,019
also have things in our environment

50
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,330
things in our culture things in our

51
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:11,860
media things that are surround us that

52
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,800
we have no consciousness about

53
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,340
whatsoever yet they leave an impression

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,010
they leave a vision they leave something

55
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,590
inside of us that we take to be the

56
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,209
truth and that's what we're going to

57
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,319
talk about today is finding your way

58
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,269
through these things

59
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,879
so that you have a sense of what can I

60
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:33,280
do about this so there's work here to do

61
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,200
for everybody me included still on a

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,519
journey doing this so I'd like to some

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,599
where they take you through this so you

64
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:46,870
get a sense of this

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:50,010
I like this statement this is from a

66
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:55,180
group of people that were in Ireland in

67
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:56,620
1791 and they were very very much

68
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,030
affected by the the different

69
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,950
organizations that were around right

70
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,299
there were lodges around there were

71
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,220
Brotherhood's around all this other

72
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:05,439
stuff and they said I'd like to have the

73
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,250
benevolent conspiracy that cares about

74
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,780
everybody everybody matters that's what

75
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,599
I'd like to see here that's what I'd

76
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,329
like to have I consider our lives and

77
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,450
the world that we live in to be that

78
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:22,540
benevolent conspiracy I approach myself

79
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,839
and my life in a way that I understand

80
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,950
that this is what I'm here for to be a

81
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,220
smarter better human being and that's a

82
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,478
good place to come from

83
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,449
so what's the learning environment for

84
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:40,479
doing that your life the lives of others

85
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:42,040
I know we're all busy I know that we all

86
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,510
have a lot of stuff in our minds we're

87
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,280
busy driving towards things we're busy

88
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,590
doing things I know how that works

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,299
believe me I understand what that feels

90
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,069
like I understand what that looks like

91
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:52,299
and what it sounds like when you're in

92
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:54,399
the middle of your day and what's

93
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:58,540
happening there that is that is not

94
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,799
foreign to me whatsoever so this is so

95
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,429
that you can take better care of

96
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,750
yourself

97
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,019
is what we're going to be talking about

98
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,459
and by taking better care of yourself

99
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,870
I'd like to think that if you follow

100
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:09,970
some of the things that we talked about

101
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:16,599
today you'll be taking better care of

102
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:20,769
others as well so what sucks about

103
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:26,469
unconscious bias give me anything it's

104
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:29,440
hard it's hard what else it crops up

105
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:33,870
when you don't expect it yeah it's

106
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,870
invisible you don't know it what else

107
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,790
influences thoughts and decisions even

108
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:45,099
when you don't even plan on it doing so

109
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:46,540
yes it makes you do things you didn't

110
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,430
want to do what's the number one defense

111
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,449
you get from somebody when you when you

112
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,720
point out that they've exhibited

113
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:55,380
something that is a bias it wasn't my

114
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,380
intention

115
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,960
we're gonna talk about that that's great

116
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:22,719
that you brought that up

117
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:24,400
yes yeah get defensive right you get it

118
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,710
you get a sense of wow why am I being

119
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,169
attacked why am I being the one called

120
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,900
out on this what about when you

121
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,690
experience this and it's not directed at

122
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,229
you it's directed at somebody else how

123
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,030
do you feel in that situation

124
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,950
uncomfortable yeah I don't know what to

125
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,570
do what can I do what should I do

126
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,820
so we're gonna answer a few of those

127
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,740
questions as we go through here so all

128
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:51,700
of that and even more is what you're

129
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:55,660
going to have a sense about here's the

130
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:59,260
thing we're wired this is how we are

131
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,660
wired the DNA that we have the synapse

132
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,099
is that we fire the things that we skip

133
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,170
over because we learn them as we're

134
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,660
growing and we're becoming bigger better

135
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:11,190
humans are things that create

136
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:14,350
unconscious bias bias is everywhere we

137
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,910
need to accept that the bias exists

138
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:19,350
whether you're conscious or unconscious

139
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,400
or whatever it is the bias exists and

140
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,310
understanding that that is something

141
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,979
that we all have is the key to

142
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,860
understanding what can we do when we're

143
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,630
encountering it when we exhibit it when

144
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,770
we see it when it's pointed out to us

145
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:38,350
what can we do when that's the case so

146
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,740
we need to accept a certain amount of

147
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,750
responsibility I'm biased it's like a

148
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,390
12-step meeting hi I'm dawn I'm biased

149
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,820
right that's the kind of thing we need

150
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,979
to think about you carry biases they're

151
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,800
very beneficial in some ways they're not

152
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,140
all bad but there are a few constants

153
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,570
and these are my constants these aren't

154
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,830
from any empirical study these aren't

155
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,580
anything else but these are the

156
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:08,710
constants that I want you to think about

157
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:12,520
biases and consciousness so they're

158
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:15,599
useful sometimes right that's great also

159
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,640
you know we know about them sometimes

160
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,639
they're expected sometimes somebody said

161
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,550
they're unexpected

162
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,539
but they're present all of the time in

163
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,499
your consciousness

164
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:29,568
well unless you leave this body but is

165
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:35,840
your consciousness really gone there's a

166
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:38,360
lot of young times right and it's known

167
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,929
and expected but it is present all the

168
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:45,439
time we have the constants to do

169
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:49,099
something when we encounter are exposed

170
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:51,289
to or are witnessing any sense of bias

171
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,650
being directed at ourselves or at

172
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:56,620
somebody else

173
00:07:53,650 --> 00:08:01,669
so what rocks about cons conscious bias

174
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,870
give me some examples it does right we

175
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:04,279
were able to move quickly we're able to

176
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,810
skip over the details and get to the

177
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:11,629
crux of it right what are some of the

178
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:13,819
other rocking things yes yeah you can

179
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:16,009
actually make a connection with

180
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:18,259
unconscious bias that you would not be

181
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:20,029
able to make in the same amount of time

182
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:21,560
if you went through it iteratively and

183
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:23,270
you'd probably go left or right if you

184
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,099
did that there are a lot of advantages

185
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,568
to it so what we've got is we've got a

186
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:29,930
situation where we have something that

187
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:32,630
we accept that we have it has pluses and

188
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,190
it has minuses right there are

189
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,958
advantages things to it and then there

190
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,800
uninvent Aegeus things to it so you're

191
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,679
like what do I do

192
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:43,299
right what can I do about this then what

193
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:46,279
should I be thinking about awareness

194
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:48,410
this is what makes the difference is the

195
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,329
awareness that we have and your

196
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,300
awareness cannot be your awareness of

197
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:56,390
only yourself your awareness has to be

198
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,430
the awareness of others the path that

199
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,430
you walk is not the path that everyone

200
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,769
around you walks your neighbor your

201
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,319
coworker your boss everybody else has

202
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:08,300
their own point of view so what should I

203
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,459
do right what is it that I can do when I

204
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,439
experience or I see NEC bias and what

205
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:15,500
happens with that

206
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,690
there are four helpful mindsets that you

207
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:22,940
can keep in mind things that you want to

208
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:25,670
have in your mind so that you can be the

209
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,870
person that can do something and make a

210
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,670
difference when you encounter

211
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:34,779
unconscious bias

212
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:37,569
humility it's really important most of

213
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:40,029
us only exhibit it when we are caught in

214
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:43,000
a lie when we're caught in something

215
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:45,220
that we're feeling under the rug all

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,380
kinds of reasons we can feel it I want

217
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,350
it to be a cultivated thing when can I

218
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:53,410
turn on my humility when do I need to

219
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,880
adopt the sense of humility right when

220
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,050
there's something happening that has

221
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,269
unconscious bias I encourage you to have

222
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,849
humility there and you do not have to be

223
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,920
the hero right you don't have to be the

224
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,940
one to fix it can we all fix everybody

225
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,560
here no we can't however we can inform

226
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,459
everyone and do something about that

227
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,869
and you might not have the answer right

228
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,279
a lot of us feel I know what it needs to

229
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,110
happen here and you need to do this and

230
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,449
you need to do that that may be true

231
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,790
that may be the wrong way to go about it

232
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:30,339
your humility will help you not try to

233
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:33,550
be that empowerment right I need to have

234
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:35,199
people that think similar do I do and I

235
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:39,160
need to know who it is that I can work

236
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:41,979
with that I can know I've got some

237
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,829
backing I've got somebody to help me

238
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,350
I've got something I can do know what

239
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:49,300
your team strengths are right we all

240
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,190
build teams around ourselves when you're

241
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,899
talking about unconscious bias you

242
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,540
shouldn't be the one doing that alone

243
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:58,000
you should be having others with you

244
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,890
whether it's in the moment or is after

245
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,980
the moment or whatever it is that's what

246
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:04,180
you want to do and be willing to let

247
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,649
others solve the problems there may be

248
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,569
somebody that's better equipped to take

249
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:12,730
that to the fruition than you curiosity

250
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,430
this is my favorite one if we are

251
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,490
curious no matter what the situation no

252
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:20,319
matter where we are if we're curious

253
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,060
we're going to get to an answer we're

254
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:24,610
gonna get to something that will help us

255
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:27,010
come to a conclusion that is very

256
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:29,589
helpful that is very important for us to

257
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,480
understand curiosity is one of the

258
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,920
values where I work it's one of the

259
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,420
things we interview people for and talk

260
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,180
about and it takes a lot of different

261
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,910
forms but I can't stress enough if you

262
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,689
are curious about why you think what you

263
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,399
think what

264
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,529
who said that bothered you what you saw

265
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,649
that made you feel funny if you when you

266
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:51,490
get curious about that you will find out

267
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:53,500
more and if you exhibit and somebody

268
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,540
comes to you and says hey when you did

269
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,040
this here's what happened there get

270
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,079
curious about why would they say that

271
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,969
what was it they're telling you what is

272
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:02,739
it that they'd like to know what is it

273
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,420
can they tell you more about what it is

274
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,910
you've done that's really important to

275
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,219
do and think about likely scenarios and

276
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,569
trade offs right you don't have to jump

277
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,759
into things you can actually think about

278
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:14,649
if I say something now what happens if I

279
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:16,000
say something later what happens what's

280
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:19,420
the reaction of the person I'm talking

281
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,550
to right you have lots of tools

282
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:25,719
available to you curiosity is a really

283
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:26,979
good one and then adaptability how many

284
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,350
people here are adaptable raise your

285
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,459
hand how many people have to be

286
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:36,399
adaptable or they will lose their minds

287
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:39,040
there is a natural tendency to

288
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,870
adaptability however my version of

289
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,719
adaptability in note I can adapt to is

290
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:46,060
predicated on Who I am where I am where

291
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,370
I've come from and what I'm how I'm

292
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,319
wired and that's very different than

293
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,569
yours very different than yours very

294
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:55,380
different than yours

295
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:58,509
everybody sense of adaptability they

296
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,699
tailor it to what they need and what

297
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:02,100
they have I think that when we're

298
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:05,769
talking about unconscious bias

299
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:09,910
adaptability is knowing when to pivot

300
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:12,910
and to do it boldly that's the big one

301
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:16,209
we are always afraid to be bold and I

302
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:19,480
can't stress enough if you are honest

303
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:22,899
with yourself if you're curious if you

304
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:26,439
have the adaptability to take that step

305
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:28,389
that you normally don't take you'll be

306
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:30,189
successful even if you're not successful

307
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:34,689
in that moment you're forwarding

308
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:36,189
something that's better so these are

309
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,449
some of the mindsets that you can have

310
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:40,420
these are some of the things that you

311
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:42,670
can do they're not perfect they're not

312
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,949
all employable to every situation you

313
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,740
have but I'm telling you no matter what

314
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:50,920
side of the equation of unconscious bias

315
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,130
you're on if you exhibit and internalize

316
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,069
these things

317
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:58,610
and show them you're going to come out

318
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,780
being a smarter better human being thank

319
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:05,320
you

320
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:05,319
[Applause]

321
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,869
you
