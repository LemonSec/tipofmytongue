00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:21,039
[Applause]

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,040
awesome well thank you Estefan so cool

3
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,570
getting to know you more and do the

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:31,660
personal color con okay

5
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:36,850
awesome it'll be fun

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:38,559
so this talk getting along when you see

7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,700
someone being harassed or bullied or

8
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,459
when you're being harassed and bullied

9
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,780
the talk comes largely from the allies

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,030
point of view because it's really really

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,320
hard when you're in that situation to

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,089
address it yourself although there are

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,410
some things doing yourself make it a lot

14
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:52,329
easier for other people to help you if

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:55,959
it's still needed we're gonna talk about

16
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:57,999
that towards the end but this talk came

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,039
out of kind of also a little bit about

18
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:02,199
who I am my mom is hard of hearing so I

19
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,720
got a also federal government amusingly

20
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,100
enough so I got a good tour of the

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,600
federal government grievance process

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,309
when I was a kid because my mom was left

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,869
out of meetings cuz well she couldn't

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,330
hear and she wasn't allowed to

25
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,159
participate so I was able to kind of get

26
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,960
a first-hand look at what workplace

27
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,540
harassment looks like when you go home

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,158
and it's horrible it's horrible for your

29
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,930
health it's horrible for your family

30
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,909
it's not just someone was a jerk to you

31
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,320
at work it's when you go home it

32
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:27,909
continues to impact your life and it

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,258
impacts your health when she finally did

34
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:31,060
have to retire from the federal

35
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:34,000
government my mom's health still hasn't

36
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,799
come back so it's just I got a really

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,479
good tour of how much it sucks and I

38
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,860
don't like it and so I you know try and

39
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,409
advocate for that not being something

40
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,270
that happens I've been in nonprofits

41
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:45,420
pretty much my entire career I started

42
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,289
at a Don profit that helped people with

43
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,930
intellectual disabilities and physical

44
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:51,130
disabilities live independently and also

45
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,380
function in the community which was

46
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,420
incredible I've been in this community

47
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,899
since I was like I don't know shorter

48
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,670
not so short so I was like 15 going to

49
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:02,649
DC 2600 and there was some Irish Sea

50
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,229
before that so I've had a chance to

51
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:07,659
watch us grow up our DEFCON 9 and DEFCON

52
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:09,429
19 alright DEFCON 19 still kind of rowdy

53
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:11,830
on the side I don't love but def kind 9

54
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,690
horrible so I can tell you we've grown

55
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,450
up a lot and I've just watched it and

56
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,520
been part of it I'm a Nova hacker are

57
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,519
there any other Nova hackers in here no

58
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,170
West Coast ok incidentally we're going

59
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,360
to be doing a public speaking group at

60
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,799
Pascal we're still working at the dates

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,280
and times but if you want to practice

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,600
your

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,459
would like to do it in an inclusive

64
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,410
space we're gonna be spitting that up

65
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,510
starting next year

66
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,299
and so I've done women's projects Tierra

67
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,370
con which was largely about women and

68
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,000
also everyone else creating space base

69
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:45,670
for people of all backgrounds and allies

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,400
and so ladies of kamas women's directed

71
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,890
I serve the 50-plus which is super

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,620
freakin cool AARP first thing people

73
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,299
hear is oh my god I got my AARP card but

74
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,160
when you actually work for a company

75
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,900
that advocates for seniors on a daily

76
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,450
basis where you know they're out suing

77
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,190
people who aren't nice to seniors when

78
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,230
we're making policy and legislation I

79
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,720
love what I do and that's that's what I

80
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,640
get to do but this is not a work talk

81
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,680
I'm not speaking for anyone HR has not

82
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,730
signed off on this I am NOT it's not a

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,370
work talk technology diversified is a

84
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,149
brand-new shiny nonprofit that builds in

85
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,260
the work we did with Tierra con which is

86
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,430
diversity and inclusion focus so

87
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,560
bringing folks of diverse backgrounds

88
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,819
together and including them so working

89
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,310
with folks of diverse backgrounds and

90
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:32,350
working with allies how do we come

91
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,630
together to change the culture because

92
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,430
in one moment you may be the target of a

93
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,840
bullying situation and in the next

94
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,970
moment you may be able to help someone

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,280
who's being bullied we are all allies we

96
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,590
are all brought together and you can be

97
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,360
bullied if you're a guy or a gal you can

98
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,829
be bullied anytime so how do we come

99
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,989
together to change the overall culture

100
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:53,489
and tone so that stuff is just not

101
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:56,739
acceptable that's kind of what I'm about

102
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,690
so it's important when you're talking

103
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:59,769
about harassment and discrimination to

104
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,140
know what harassment and discrimination

105
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:06,640
are and why that is so impactful

106
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,279
harassment is because you're a member in

107
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,500
a protected class so your gender your

108
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,540
religion where you come from these

109
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,180
protected classes are partially

110
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,880
federally mandated and partially state

111
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,769
mandated and so they are because they

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,140
are based on laws there are time periods

113
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,060
for investigation so if you come to HR

114
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,560
with an allegation of harassment they

115
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,539
need to start investigating it like the

116
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,030
next day they have a time line and they

117
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:32,820
have to follow their process but if you

118
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,289
go to HR because you're being bullied

119
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,169
totally different scenario you are not

120
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:39,700
protected because bullying is not

121
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:41,049
because of a protected class therefore

122
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,870
there is no alleged

123
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,540
there is a very small exception and when

124
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:50,440
I say small I mean four states all right

125
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:53,170
what I mean is Utah and California have

126
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,700
a law against abusive workplace behavior

127
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:59,770
abuse of conduct that is that require

128
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,659
intention so you have to intend to be a

129
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,609
jerk to someone you have to attend to

130
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,230
abuse someone that can be hard to prove

131
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,450
right the intention because you can also

132
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,270
say oh I was just clueless so you have

133
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:14,140
to document and show a pattern there's a

134
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,849
lot of burden of proof one doesn't

135
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,680
mention intention at all Tennessee so

136
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,840
it's a lot looser and then Nevada says

137
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,940
bullying is illegal whether or not is

138
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,130
intend to cause or actually causes harm

139
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,650
because bullying does cause harm you go

140
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,820
home and you throw up or you get IBS are

141
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,549
these little stress related sicknesses

142
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,690
it's not it's not something that you see

143
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,720
at work and then it doesn't come home

144
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:37,030
with you so if you have someone who's

145
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,040
being bullied it is really really

146
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,989
important to go and be a support to that

147
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,360
person because they are not legally

148
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,980
protected they the only protections they

149
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,810
have are based on the policies at your

150
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,150
place of employment around workplace

151
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,040
bullying and workplace violence does not

152
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,330
cover workplace bullying totally

153
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,490
different thing weird police violence is

154
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,200
what I'm screaming at you all right but

155
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,000
there's all of this really unacceptable

156
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,380
behavior that starts with leaving people

157
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,830
off mail chains not bringing people to

158
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,140
meetings

159
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,690
ignoring people's ideas still not okay

160
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,789
you know all the way up to humiliating

161
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,900
people and email chains by calling them

162
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,730
out for your not and happy with their

163
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,950
work in front of their entire team up

164
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,750
too before you get to the screaming

165
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,400
point so there's a whole lot of room for

166
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,280
things to go wrong for someone and they

167
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,109
are not protected but if you go with

168
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,479
them if you log with them if you support

169
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,570
them and you become part of that problem

170
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,660
with them then you're protected class

171
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:32,530
because you are covered under NLRA

172
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:34,780
National Labor Relations Act as

173
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,650
collective bargaining so if it affects

174
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,630
more than one worker

175
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,370
you've got protection so be there for

176
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,200
your friends and people who are affected

177
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,670
that was the whole point of that slide

178
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:47,409
very important to know so we were going

179
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:50,440
to watch some mr. robot who likes mr.

180
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,910
robot okay so we're gonna have to kind

181
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,200
of imagine in our heads because the

182
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,530
video is not going to play nicely with

183
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,469
us

184
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,719
today but who scenes that episode one

185
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,210
mr. robot okay a lot of you this is

186
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,520
super cool alright so there's this girl

187
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,760
Angela right and she goes into this

188
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,020
meeting with all of these other people

189
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,080
Angela's there with Elliot the other

190
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,210
main character and when they go in that

191
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,120
meeting is to discuss a breach something

192
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,380
happened and you have the MSSP people so

193
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,390
the security people I'm not as much of a

194
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,520
mr. Batman but I can discuss the social

195
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,590
contracts you got the people from the

196
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,479
contracting company right you've got the

197
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,270
people who hire them evil Corp

198
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,510
definitely evil guy's a jerk and then

199
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:34,780
you've got the feds who say nothing

200
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,550
so say nothing not my problem

201
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,830
so they go in and they're having this

202
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:43,540
meeting about this post breach activity

203
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:46,359
and Angela's boss says let's have Angela

204
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,280
who is the account executive give us the

205
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,480
the readout on the incident you know

206
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,840
because she's the one who knows the best

207
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,550
well the C makes one error and it'll

208
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,369
start saying hey okay well this is what

209
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,020
we're doing and she makes a mistake on

210
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,400
the time which if you've handled an

211
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,260
incident you may have made a mistake

212
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,969
when you were doing the read out - it's

213
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,039
not that hard

214
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,350
and the CEO promptly jumps in her neck

215
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,010
and he's like we need someone technical

216
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:13,270
here you're not on the ball he's really

217
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,010
really hostile towards her he was

218
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,280
already getting worked up when she

219
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:21,550
started to talk he was already getting

220
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,429
steamed up and then he basically had her

221
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,169
thrown out of the room so he went to his

222
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,669
direct and his direct went to the head

223
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:30,940
of the contracting company and he

224
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:32,319
grabbed Angela and he took her out and

225
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,740
there were some really interesting

226
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,419
points in this scenario one is Elliot

227
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,310
who was friends with Angela apparently

228
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,370
from childhood again I'm not a huge mr.

229
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:45,819
Rohit fan jumps in to try and help

230
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,430
Angela he's like you know interrupting

231
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,890
the boss trying to berate her by

232
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,140
answering her question for her that

233
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,420
actually didn't help her when I watched

234
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,949
the video I watched it three or four

235
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,020
times I didn't catch it until the second

236
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,820
or third viewing so what Elliot was

237
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,770
doing and trying to answer the question

238
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,450
for Angela but she was being berated

239
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,880
when she was trying to answer was

240
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,360
actually supporting the bully because it

241
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,910
was taking

242
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,899
power from Angela it was taking away her

243
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,250
ability to be an agent and she wasn't

244
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:16,750
able to pick back up from them and that

245
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,899
was right around when she got shoved out

246
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,970
of the room for not being technical and

247
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:23,110
not being at the level and we need a

248
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,779
higher level of people in this room

249
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,839
which was pretty much how that went down

250
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:30,160
so there was some attempted support but

251
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,310
it was the wrong kind of support and it

252
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,920
didn't work and there was an episode

253
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:38,709
later where Angela raised this with

254
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,019
Elliot and Elliot was completely

255
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:43,209
clueless he didn't realize that what he

256
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:45,910
done hadn't worked for her I wouldn't

257
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,469
have worked for anyone right so this is

258
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,839
one of those things where it's not that

259
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,850
hard to do the wrong thing meaning well

260
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:57,670
but there are ways of doing the right

261
00:09:51,850 --> 00:10:00,190
thing and meaning well the last really

262
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:03,160
important character scenario when there

263
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,750
to mention were the bystanders so when

264
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,029
you go into a situation like that and

265
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,370
you've got a boss being completely

266
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:11,200
uncool out of line and you look at him

267
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,420
and you know yeah yeah it's not okay or

268
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,360
some other person who is in power or

269
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,310
just someone in a meeting it is really

270
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,470
hard to stand up to them and say hey no

271
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,449
I'm cool in that moment because there's

272
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,670
a lot of pressure to please that person

273
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:26,469
in that position to power the minute the

274
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:29,860
Angela left the meeting everyone kind of

275
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,140
leaned in and got huddled and it was it

276
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,300
was totally a we're here to be with you

277
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:37,720
and so there was a lot of pressure to

278
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,060
not support her and it really sucked for

279
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,649
Angela and she left right that can

280
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:46,989
happen to each and every one of us

281
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:49,149
regardless of gender race disability or

282
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,880
ability any of us can be shut out of a

283
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:54,130
meeting at any time but it was

284
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,720
particularly sucky for her and it was

285
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,149
particularly sucky I think for the

286
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,140
bystanders and I kind of want to dig in

287
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:05,260
on that one of the things I have found

288
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:07,390
most sucky is when I have to watch

289
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,949
someone else be treated badly and

290
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,569
there's nothing I can do about it you

291
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:12,130
know what do I do

292
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,360
I don't know what to do I don't want to

293
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,790
get pulled up and hit in front of HR

294
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,360
myself I don't want to cause problems or

295
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:22,069
make anyone else uncomfortable but that

296
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,660
person is definitely uncomfortable

297
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:28,220
and so some of the reasons for

298
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,870
bystanders to be passive are they're

299
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,880
afraid of their loss of privacy because

300
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,220
the HR investigations are not private

301
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,020
they can say that but they do have to

302
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,420
investigate and that information is not

303
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,250
private they're afraid of bad

304
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,079
consequences or the bully taking it out

305
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,130
on them they're afraid of getting too

306
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,930
involved they don't want to deal with

307
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,970
this drama and at home or at

308
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:50,120
work they're afraid because they're

309
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,560
introverts but they may think that

310
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,420
there's nothing's going to come it but

311
00:11:51,560 --> 00:12:04,520
you can absolutely stand up for other

312
00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:06,860
people and have it be effective so so

313
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,810
you're there what do you say what do you

314
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,960
do right like I just saw this it's not

315
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:14,329
okay and there's it's totally okay to

316
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,200
not do anything right then if you're

317
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:20,060
ever in that situation it's totally okay

318
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,570
yeah I pulled out the that slide what's

319
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,550
going to play video at this point so

320
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:28,010
it's okay to not say anything right then

321
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,979
go talk to them afterwards go and say

322
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:33,860
hey I hear you I notice it wasn't just

323
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,330
you I'm gonna log just you know I kept a

324
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,750
note of what happened who was there and

325
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:40,880
if you ever need to talk to me you can't

326
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:43,190
it can be very traumatizing to be

327
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,680
targeted and it can also be traumatizing

328
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,390
to be the to be a secondary trauma by

329
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,489
being the witness especially when you

330
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,949
feel disempowered so it's not that

331
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,420
person's job to do your work for you if

332
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,070
you're traumatized there's ways of

333
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,550
getting help therapists are awesome EAP

334
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:01,280
s do not suck but being there for that

335
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:04,069
person is really really important

336
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,600
logging cannot be underestimated if it

337
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,820
did not get written down it didn't

338
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,640
happen all right if you did not write it

339
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,620
down it did not happen so you can go to

340
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,380
work and be bullied by your boss or

341
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,030
someone else every day for two years and

342
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,600
if you didn't write it down it didn't

343
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:23,360
happen so it's really important other

344
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,680
things is an ally you can do you can go

345
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:30,170
someone just makes horrible racist

346
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:31,670
remark what you mean by that dark yeah

347
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,469
no seriously what did you mean when you

348
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,050
said that house is on the wrong side of

349
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,450
the tracks you

350
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,699
no oh because you mean it's the black

351
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,640
neighborhood right no see you you have

352
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,500
to challenge that stuff as you feel safe

353
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,839
and comfortable and you don't have to do

354
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,000
it in that moment if I were in a room

355
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,740
where I had the CEO griping up my

356
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,620
contracting company I had the feds being

357
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:57,750
completely useless no comment and right

358
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,610
I wouldn't necessarily stand up there

359
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,720
and be like yo CEO guy you're horrible

360
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,010
and you need to knock it off because I

361
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,110
would have walked out too and I probably

362
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,380
wouldn't have a job the next day right

363
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,000
but afterwards go to that person or take

364
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,519
the person who's being inappropriate

365
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,140
aside being humiliated in front of a lot

366
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,240
of people is going to get a negative

367
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,120
reaction right and sometimes this stuff

368
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,250
is just being clueless like Elliott in

369
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,959
that particular shoot in that particular

370
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:25,230
moment he didn't realize that talking

371
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:26,518
for her was hurtful but if you go and

372
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,200
you have that side conversation

373
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,180
sometimes you can create real change and

374
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,190
the other person doesn't have to do it

375
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,050
the target doesn't have to but you kind

376
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,610
of got to judge your scenarios carefully

377
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:39,540
like I have got people who I will go to

378
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,860
and be like hi so you know and some

379
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,349
people I can do that and some people you

380
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:50,430
can't but look into it think it through

381
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:53,130
trust your gut and then all right what

382
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:55,349
else can I do because that still feels

383
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,290
kind of like not a lot right I can go to

384
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,459
HR with them it's okay because then

385
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,839
you're a protected class if you're going

386
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:02,939
together if it's bullying that's

387
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,490
something you can do it will possibly

388
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:09,540
cause problems for you as well

389
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:10,709
75% of HR involvement is new job so you

390
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,170
kind of got to think that through

391
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,339
definitely don't push the target to do

392
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,079
things they're not comfortable with

393
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,510
because they may not want to change jobs

394
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,229
they may choose to take the abuse it's

395
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:24,720
not something you can decide for them

396
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:27,079
but what you can do is in every possible

397
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,600
opportunity you get say something good

398
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:32,099
so hey coworker I want to recognize your

399
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,199
greatness today and getting all of these

400
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,149
policies together for us because I know

401
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,709
it's not fun and I really want to

402
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,170
recognize the effort and the quality of

403
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:42,359
your work right doing that stuff in

404
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,149
front of other people changes how they

405
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,339
treat the target because then the

406
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:50,310
messaging isn't all negative it's not

407
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,810
all this person stupid it's not all this

408
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,069
person doesn't contribute it's this

409
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,469
person's work is always wrong

410
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:58,890
no now let's let me point out this super

411
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,540
positive thing about this person or

412
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,819
point out the certain positive thing

413
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,199
about the working style in your group so

414
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,770
that you can change that you can

415
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:09,420
influence the entire team and spread on

416
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,980
out by being a good example of how to

417
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,979
talk to you and talk with other people

418
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:24,120
aha now I can actually go to a slide and

419
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:26,940
not not have a video so my craft

420
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,529
formations are genuine small acts of

421
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,240
kindness so that's what I was just

422
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,490
talking about in terms of saying nice

423
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,720
things you do not have to limit it to

424
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,600
someone you know who's being picked on

425
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,060
you can go okay what are the strategic

426
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,520
initiatives I want to encourage like I

427
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,109
want to encourage mmmm

428
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,760
or you know communications a

429
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,920
communications group to do this certain

430
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,480
kind of communication so you give them

431
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,800
lots of positive reinforcement and

432
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,040
suddenly they're doing what you want

433
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,630
right you can use micro formations and

434
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,189
encouragement to change corporate

435
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,470
culture and people's willingness to buy

436
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,699
into your ideas because if they feel

437
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,920
supported by you they're much more

438
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:05,819
likely to want to do things for you and

439
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,040
help you build your initiatives so I use

440
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:09,359
that to basically I pick an area where

441
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,639
people are being nice to people and I

442
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,050
say nice things I'm like yes no I want

443
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,150
to talk to you about how this group this

444
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,980
outsourced contracting group is super

445
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,199
awesome let's talk about this victory

446
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,910
they made today in bone management

447
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,140
because it's a huge victory let's talk

448
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,300
about their achievements over the last

449
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,100
six months doing that for groups that

450
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,050
are marginalized recognizing their

451
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,909
greatness and their success can change

452
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,770
the entire organizations concept of that

453
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,020
group and improve the concept and the

454
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,610
performance of that group so there's you

455
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,770
cannot say enough things about saying

456
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:40,439
nice things about nice people or even

457
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,260
jerky people cuz they can change

458
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,940
bullying policy you're not protected

459
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,230
with that one unless you're in those

460
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,990
four states and then enjoy your lawsuit

461
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:54,570
also if you have to call someone call

462
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:57,690
lawyer I am NOT one and again set the

463
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,830
tone you are people follow you you're an

464
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,550
expert you wouldn't be in this room if

465
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,550
you weren't good at your job

466
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:08,520
and so what do you do if it occurs to

467
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,620
you right that is that is the sucky

468
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,900
slide I have had to experience bullying

469
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,010
and harassment you know I have been

470
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,750
there for people as they have

471
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,760
experienced bullying and harassment and

472
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,080
I've seen you know I know someone who's

473
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,520
right now experiencing major health

474
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:26,100
problems due to bullying and harassment

475
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:29,400
you know so it is it's horrible to be

476
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,590
targeted first thing is don't wait

477
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,220
because the longer you put up with the

478
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,730


479
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,220
the longer there is a case history of it

480
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,170
not bothering you so if they can say hey

481
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,850
this has been gone for six months and

482
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,620
you're just now saying something about

483
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:46,709
it well yeah because you were afraid to

484
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:49,770
go to HR but it still undermines your

485
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:53,250
case if you have to go to HR so start

486
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:57,180
logging early don't wait forever

487
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:59,250
it is a really good idea to validate so

488
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,100
log for a day or two or a week or two

489
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:04,770
see if this is like a pattern right get

490
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,379
a feel for it it is really important if

491
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:10,139
you can to confront your bully and do it

492
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:13,650
early and the reason for that is one is

493
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,630
the period of time at which point you

494
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,900
know it's like well she didn't mind yeah

495
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:21,090
she did and then the other thing is

496
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,590
bullies just escalate so they don't stop

497
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,600
they're not gonna go away

498
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,860
do not ever assume ability is going to

499
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,709
get tired of picking on you because

500
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,820
you're fun and you squirm the bully is

501
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,200
coming after you they're getting

502
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,850
something out of it they're getting

503
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,950
power they're getting control and

504
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,480
they're enjoying it and so the best

505
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,190
thing to do is to call them out on it

506
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,920
early because if they're a relatively

507
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,810
mild bully then they're likely to stop

508
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,800
and if they're not you'll know what

509
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,850
you're dealing with and you can take

510
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,540
action finding friends is really

511
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:50,969
important

512
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,620
back to the bullying thing and having

513
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,870
some ability to take care of yourself

514
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,000
but in general if you're being bullied

515
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,040
or harassed you have a lot of trauma

516
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,390
going on and it happening a lot so

517
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:06,060
having people who can tell you you're

518
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:07,710
not crazy is super helpful and yeah

519
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,389
definitely if the bully doesn't stop

520
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,340
where the harasser doesn't stop or if

521
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,720
it's a cultural thing in the office talk

522
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,220
to an attorney

523
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,710
it is never about

524
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,840
use of money to call an attorney I have

525
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,620
never regretted spending money on an

526
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,490
attorney okay you can call LegalZoom

527
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,870
unfortunately Oregon doesn't do Legal

528
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,659
Zoom there's another legal plan that

529
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:30,750
covers Oregon but if you have a legal

530
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:32,039
plan use it just call spend an hour on

531
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,200
the phone with an attorney and you're

532
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,580
not going to have big problems but if

533
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,770
you don't have that conversation early

534
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:42,928
you won't know what your problems are or

535
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:44,370
how big they are and performance one of

536
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:46,470
the first things that goes to hell in a

537
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,870
handbasket when you're being bullied is

538
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,179
your performance so especially if you've

539
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:56,219
got a hidden disability or you have like

540
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:57,809
ADHD if you are having these experiences

541
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,850
that are undermining your performance

542
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:02,220
well if you have to go to the point

543
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,928
where you file with HR you go to HR and

544
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,750
you say this isn't cool they look at

545
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,280
your performance and if your performance

546
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,870
has already slipped into the toilet

547
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,520
because you've had a bad day every day

548
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,860
for the last six months to a year your

549
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,539
professional work then they can say oh

550
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,809
yeah they're just doing this because

551
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:23,700
they suck at their job so it's like this

552
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:25,260
nasty reinforcing cycle and so the way

553
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:34,049
to keep your power in your hands is to

554
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:35,640
go early and to log and so I'm going to

555
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:37,080
leave you with a quote and then answer

556
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,539
any questions I can't answer given that

557
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,990
I'm not legally an attorney just a very

558
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:47,000
interested person when everything around

559
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:49,409
you seems to be lacking in integrity

560
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,900
when you see things around you that are

561
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:54,929
not in line with what a person with

562
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,039
integrity would do you change the world

563
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:58,020
from where you're standing

564
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,940
you get active bystander training which

565
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,470
is something that is offered with even

566
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,190
more skills because this is terrifying

567
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:07,409
to speak up and you just basically stand

568
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,030
there and you say it's not okay and

569
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,179
whatever way shape or form you feel most

570
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,178
comfortable

571
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,070
you
