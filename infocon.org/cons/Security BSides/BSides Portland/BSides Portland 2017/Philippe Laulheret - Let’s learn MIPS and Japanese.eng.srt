1
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,019
so uh

2
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,890
so I'm going to I'm going to talk about

3
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:29,028
like a project that I had like last year

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,410
I think so um I want it to play like

5
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:32,870
video games and non-japanese at the same

6
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,300
time so I select reverse engineering

7
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,250
this game that we probably know it's

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:45,229
like 20 yards and it's like a pretty

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:49,010
famous RPG it's Final Fantasy 7 so the

10
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:52,129
thing is actually like like it looks

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,019
more like this actually like and awesome

12
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:58,460
graphics and all these like weird

13
00:00:54,019 --> 00:01:01,009
symbols so yeah we're going to look at

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,110
that and here's our tool we're going to

15
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:06,549
use for that is like an powerful

16
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:10,299
debugger I didn't make it I just like

17
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:12,470
useful and little like cluttered but

18
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:14,180
we're going to do some disassembly with

19
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,000
right away all right

20
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,509
radar - which is like a command line

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,380
like these assembler that's free and

22
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:27,680
really sweet and the last tool of the

23
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,240
day is called VK Chan which is um like

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,490
kind of like an online dictionary the

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,710
idea is it's an add-on for Firefox and

26
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:38,479
when you click on a word it's going to

27
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:41,869
pop up some some definition of the word

28
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,810
you're looking at so what's the

29
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:47,900
objective of this project it's um

30
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:51,020
let's take the text out of the game and

31
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:55,490
type them into like a web page so we can

32
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:59,449
use we catch on to like look upwards

33
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:00,798
while playing and it's it's different

34
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,670
than like just like Google translating

35
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,200
because you can click on the words and

36
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,430
directly know which is what is the

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,679
meaning of that word as opposed to just

38
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,120
translating everything and you know not

39
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,010
kind of losing the meaning of each

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,549
individual word which is not great if

41
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:18,409
you trying to learn Japanese so actually

42
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:20,209
I'm not I'm not the first one coming

43
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:22,120
with society and I've found like

44
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:25,760
inspiration in this project which is

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:30,470
actually pretty similar but the guy did

46
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,640
that on unlocked PC using wine and

47
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,970
the same then it was like Firefox

48
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,700
invocation and I wanted to do it for 537

49
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,410
and I picked like the PlayStation

50
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,630
version running in the emulator because

51
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:45,500
I mean the guy did already the work on

52
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,609
Windows so it's not that fun and it was

53
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,760
just like an interesting like platform

54
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:52,190
to like explore so the gods for like

55
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,140
today's presentation is first of all to

56
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,270
a fan because I mean we're not going to

57
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,100
change the world with that but if we can

58
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:02,270
have some fun while doing it that's cool

59
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,070
I'm going to try to like show you like a

60
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:09,890
few like nip stuff and maybe gives you

61
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:12,920
some Japanese like pointers or something

62
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:17,329
and I think the most important for me is

63
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:20,119
if I had this project and I set my goal

64
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:22,390
to like serve that and it wasn't that

65
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,830
hard and what I really want to share is

66
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,049
if you came up with like an ID you can

67
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,200
walk on it and power through it and

68
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,820
eventually like it happens and it's not

69
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,600
as hard as it seems in the first place

70
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:37,070
so I just want to say people if you've

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,620
like an idea like go for it and work on

72
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:44,930
it and that's it so the plan is we're

73
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,209
going to find like the text in memory

74
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,959
and we need to figure out like how to

75
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:54,680
get it out and then like like pipe it

76
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,800
into like like a web page or something

77
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,430
so we can like use the chi-chan as a

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,560
dictionary so where's the text so that's

79
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,420
the beginning of the game like on the

80
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,470
left like the guys asking oh I don't

81
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,548
think I've heard your name what's your

82
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,890
name and then you have a screen that

83
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:11,810
says what name do you want to have and

84
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,730
then you say well do I

85
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:18,440
on the right side says oh I'm blah blah

86
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:20,238
blah so what can we do is that I think

87
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,969
like information security people like to

88
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:28,130
feel like buffers with ace so we can be

89
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:30,710
like oh I'm a a that's cool so we can do

90
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,570
that and then because it's running in an

91
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,599
emulator we can take like a screenshot

92
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,969
I mean snapshot of the web and then

93
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,450
let's do the same but with B's and like

94
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,880
BBB

95
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,940
okay so I don't know if you see where

96
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm going with that but um the next step

97
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,500
is we're going to diff the two different

98
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,410
black snapshot that we took and we're

99
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,170
going to see what changed so if you look

100
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,880
at that we can select in red like on top

101
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,300
is like before before before before and

102
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,120
on the bottom is V 5 V 5 V 5 V 5 which

103
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,520
is encouraging I guess like we change

104
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,600
like one one value so it's we think that

105
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,760
those at most in one location that

106
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,900
change and this one is actually more

107
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,870
interesting because there is more more

108
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,370
to it and that like mimic what we were

109
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,130
like seeing on the like last slide that

110
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,170
says here's the name of the character

111
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,290
and then he like lying back and the name

112
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:30,930
again and like some more like Japanese

113
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:34,320
so this one is actually like the one

114
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:38,210
where the the text being displayed on

115
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:42,540
screen is coming from so yeah so that's

116
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:44,580
so what we do next we're going to put a

117
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,600
bit point on it so the idea is like

118
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:52,050
usually more commonly with people know

119
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,270
like point like that figures when like a

120
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,540
piece of code is executed but you can

121
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,150
also set up like memory break points so

122
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,300
that if like a memory location is

123
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,729
accessed it's going to trigger the I'm

124
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,320
going to trigger a break point which is

125
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:10,200
what we want to do here is like locate

126
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,550
the code that's responsible for reading

127
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,940
this code so we're going to create like

128
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:17,190
a memory me read the breakpoint on the

129
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,500
location that we found and see which is

130
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,620
the code that does it that's actually

131
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,400
actually accessing the data so here's

132
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,710
the funky debugger back if you like

133
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,210
crossing the cluttered interface like

134
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:36,989
the movie points like the first arrange

135
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:40,820
like and so yeah we find like a memory

136
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:45,960
location that's accessing that address

137
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:47,940
so when we when that like real-time what

138
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,080
happened is like every frame of the game

139
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,750
like the bleep on

140
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,000
triggers but not for all the speech but

141
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,160
only some of them

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,430
and we've seen there is a query encoding

143
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,920
going on so what we actually have is

144
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,210
most likely like a function that's in

145
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,430
like the draw loop of the game

146
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,109
so like when on every frame and that's

147
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:11,420
going to render the text from why Devine

148
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:15,410
coding so that's cool but okay let's

149
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:18,140
have a look to this function in radar to

150
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,510
have something a little more stable so

151
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,419
how we do that if you don't know like

152
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,370
whether is like a free free software and

153
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,020
it actually handles that PlayStation

154
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,270
binaries out of the box which is kind of

155
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,299
what's really surprising to me but I was

156
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:35,870
like oh that's neat and so if you ever

157
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,730
put like a PlayStation game in your PC

158
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,510
you would see something like that where

159
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,890
like it's little cutoff but um at the

160
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:46,370
bottom that's actually like the binary

161
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:49,969
that's the game so you can like pipe

162
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,110
that into like radar and so if you not

163
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,000
tell me always whether it's like kind of

164
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,960
like the VIII of the disassembly world

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,919
where like you have a lot of like

166
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,239
command line weird stuff so you can run

167
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,430
like not to analysis to like find the

168
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,050
function and whatnot and something that

169
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,990
was useful to me is like you can ask it

170
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,910
to display like video text instead of

171
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,560
like actual like me B's assembly which

172
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,660
if you don't know anything about me is

173
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,790
like helpful so did you not have to

174
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:20,600
learn like a whole set of a whole set of

175
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:22,940
new meme onyx and whatnot so we can have

176
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,169
a look to like the function that's

177
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,570
response that we were like looking at

178
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:30,620
you know a debugger so these were like

179
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,130
the big breakpoint figures and it

180
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,860
figures

181
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,539
it's like accessing like that like the

182
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,120
memory address at like SEO and we can

183
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:41,000
see that SEO is being assigned at the

184
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,210
top of the function so that might be

185
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,580
useful like for later on and if we look

186
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:54,260
a little down to this function we can

187
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:56,480
see more processing and okay so

188
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,870
something that's really hard to see here

189
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,660
at the bottom

190
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,160
I wanted to share that with you guys

191
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,829
I've liked his version in Andy's

192
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:09,040
assembly so there's just a cute little

193
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:12,190
like basic block and we can see that SEO

194
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,020
is incremented but that's after like the

195
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,300
jump and the second unconditional jump

196
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,880
so I was like what the hell is a quitter

197
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,439
or something

198
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,930
actually no but it took me like a while

199
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,380
to learn about that do you know anyone

200
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:30,250
knows what what this is about

201
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:33,430
mm-hmm exactly so di D is um it's hard

202
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,680
to see the idea is some architecture

203
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,529
like wants to lock up to my side

204
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,760
pipeline and so they like the jump is

205
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:41,290
going to take like more than one cycle

206
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,240
to like execute so there is like more

207
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,829
instruction that I fit after the jump

208
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,730
that are going to execute it before the

209
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:52,600
jump figures and so that's not a bug

210
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:55,660
that's exactly the way lag meats work so

211
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,490
yeah that's it was like interesting like

212
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,819
tidbits I discovered about like that

213
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:03,820
architecture so we see that geo is

214
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,050
incremented and that's more the bottom

215
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
of the function like in other places

216
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:10,630
well like we will switch like increase

217
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,670
as zero and with some stuff and then if

218
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,680
the conditions are right we're going to

219
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,550
jump back to like the beginning of the

220
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,839
function which is basically but what

221
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,310
does that mean is we like actually like

222
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,410
iterating through the whole like buffer

223
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,530
that we had and we like some processing

224
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:29,230
are going on and if we look at some of

225
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:32,560
the tests well this is like magic values

226
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,920
that data is compared to like each some

227
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,219
bytes are compared to and if we look

228
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:43,479
back at the memory dump we had we can

229
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:45,370
see that a seven and FF are like in that

230
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,110
them so like it's pretty convincing that

231
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:55,270
we like looking at the right stuff and

232
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:56,740
that's stuff I like meaning so so so it

233
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,750
turns out like a seven would be like a

234
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,420
line break and FF would be like a

235
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,070
terminating cha like so that the game

236
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,870
knows that it needs to stop processing

237
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,710
the

238
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:10,540
the string so let's go back to the plan

239
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:13,660
we wanted to find text in memory we did

240
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,150
it but actually Zeiss like a new issue

241
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:21,310
that like showed up which is like what

242
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:22,630
the hell is this encoding so we could do

243
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:26,380
like a bunch of stuff to figure out like

244
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:28,960
what the encoding is like if we do like

245
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,150
BBB it's going to be like like we have

246
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,130
before we turn to b5 and we could like

247
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,160
iterate and see like oh the letters are

248
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:39,370
what they are it's keep increasing okay

249
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,170
we could also just try to modify the new

250
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,150
allocation and see what happens

251
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:47,110
actually wound up doing was like I kind

252
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:49,270
of like I googled it and it turns out

253
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,710
like this video game is like super

254
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,880
popular and it's been like 20 years so

255
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,110
like a lot of people have been like

256
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,030
working on reverse engineering that

257
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,550
stuff and so for instance I found that

258
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:00,520
which is not quite useful because it's

259
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,680
the tractor map for like the English

260
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,290
version but you still I give like ideas

261
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,120
of what's going on and for instance we

262
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,380
can see that like East 7 would be like

263
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,470
line break and so on

264
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,150
so and they're like much more

265
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,830
information on the website about like

266
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,709
the structure of the game and stuff so

267
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,420
that that was needed to find that so if

268
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,120
we think about it like the what's what's

269
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,260
the font in the game it's either like

270
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,520
something that will be like in the bios

271
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,610
of the console and that would just

272
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,720
provide like printing capabilities to

273
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,610
all the games

274
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,110
oh it could be a constant front and the

275
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,360
custom font would be like glyph in

276
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,400
memory somewhere and so it actually

277
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,700
turns out that that's the right that's

278
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,110
the latter we have like some spreadsheet

279
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,950
somewhere that we need to find that

280
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:48,610
contain the font so let's try to look

281
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:52,630
for the assets and see where the

282
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:56,290
spreadsheets are so if we dig more into

283
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:58,960
the into the game like this a bin files

284
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,270
that contains a bunch of stuff we can

285
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:04,660
run like bin work on them which kind of

286
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,980
work bin work is a tool that's people

287
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,370
use for like reverse engineering like

288
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,440
few moas and stuff it's it knows a lot

289
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:15,340
of signature of things and as then it's

290
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,020
able to pass binaries and say oh maybe

291
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,760
it's a I've found like some zips

292
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,960
a signature here here's a Linux kernel

293
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:25,020
or something so like here we can see

294
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,460
it's like a lot of gzip compressed data

295
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,800
um I was a singing like in fortunately

296
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,090
bin work is a little like confused or

297
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,589
something and it's not doing a perfect

298
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:38,560
job at extracting the stuff so like by

299
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:40,990
looking at digging it more it turns out

300
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,930
that we find this like structure where

301
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:48,190
we first have like in some of the files

302
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:50,290
there is first field that says oh here's

303
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,750
like an entry in the file that's that

304
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,610
big and then like you the entries I

305
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,400
could J zip something so you can carve

306
00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:00,250
that out knowing how big it is and then

307
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,090
like NJ zip it and you get something

308
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,810
like that

309
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:07,150
which I think it's the beginning is like

310
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,750
a team header which is Tim is like an

311
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:13,180
image format on the PlayStation that I

312
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,860
think it was like well like the position

313
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,870
was like shipping with like is like an

314
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,240
SDK that could handle that which is

315
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:23,170
basically like an image format and we

316
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:26,020
don't really want to like implement or

317
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,670
on like decoding of Tim but it turns out

318
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,420
that people have done it before so there

319
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,339
is like this awesome

320
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:34,890
Tim to PNG that you can find online and

321
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:38,950
so what do we find

322
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:41,199
so here's like some cool stuff extracted

323
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:44,710
from the from the game on the left side

324
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,510
it's like a lot of sprites the color is

325
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:48,460
wrong because I guess like the color

326
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,620
palette was on pick properly but we

327
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,740
select recognize a lot of like element

328
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,420
from the game and what we really care

329
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,930
about is like the right side whereas we

330
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:01,030
actually like three three like sheets of

331
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,430
characters like the top one and then

332
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:08,250
like this bottom one and that third one

333
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:13,689
so so it's what we're like looking for

334
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:18,780
in terms of fonts and stuff so if we

335
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:21,220
look at deep into this like spread like

336
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,920
spreadsheet we can notice that like all

337
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,570
the characters are like on on a grid

338
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,189
they're like all the same size the

339
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,930
second fixed-width font

340
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,450
which is why I like it's fine for like

341
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,699
the Japanese character because I like

342
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,230
always meant to be like in a same size

343
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,370
but like it looks a little funky with

344
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,990
the English characters because like it

345
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:45,080
doesn't handle like kerning were like

346
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,790
you know you'd write some letters like

347
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,870
close out which was to make it look

348
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:54,199
better but anyway so as I was saying

349
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,970
before some of the values if you think

350
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,410
that's in the encoding like everything

351
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,750
that's below is seven is actually just

352
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:03,350
like a lookup on this lock first on the

353
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,940
first page sheet so like the top top

354
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:10,040
left character would be encoded as like

355
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:16,370
1 and then 2 3 4 and so on a 7 is like a

356
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:18,650
line break and then like in Indo games

357
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,510
are like these special values if a to Fe

358
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,980
that would trigger like look up in also

359
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,150
spreadsheets for like countries which

360
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,860
are like the most like complicated

361
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:31,220
characters so here's like just some code

362
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:34,340
for like possessing the going through

363
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:37,340
like the encoding with I'm just like its

364
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,680
movin to like the rest of the content so

365
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,620
the plan was finding the text memory

366
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,170
figuring out the encoding but now we

367
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,900
want to get the text out of the game so

368
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,170
how we do that we find like a debugger

369
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,939
that we can use programmatically and

370
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,990
then we will like set a breakpoint at

371
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,000
the top of the function that we're

372
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,370
looking at and with the memory location

373
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,320
and get it out so we're going to

374
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:05,990
instrument that chunk of code so how so

375
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,970
like the PlayStation emulator was using

376
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,859
is like open source and that has like a

377
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,810
built-in debugger as we could see but as

378
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:13,579
ever the 3 no documentation of it we

379
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,500
don't get a black in the source code so

380
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,119
is like the explanation of the protocol

381
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,150
which is just like a client-server like

382
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,619
communication where you just like send

383
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,530
commands like also to big money into

384
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:26,239
Bitcoin and so on so we can like program

385
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,160
the stuff so it's like pretty easy with

386
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,910
just like set back like I reimplemented

387
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,150
like a simpler clients that would send

388
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:37,659
the data send up the commands

389
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:40,419
with the data and so on so that's the

390
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:41,650
first like try you can see on the left

391
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:44,470
like some debugging thing and it's

392
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:48,610
printing in a console like some of the

393
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:52,299
text that's on screen so as I still like

394
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:54,010
some issue I said there is like like

395
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:56,950
five like we like cooking for like five

396
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:59,200
spreadsheets in the spreadsheet so we in

397
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:02,980
the in the game and we only sees three

398
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,419
of them those but there is like at least

399
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:10,110
extremis thing so OOP

400
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:13,779
never mind that's coming next sorry

401
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:17,459
that's like another issue so there a lot

402
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:22,090
of characters like Japanese as like to

403
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,380
to set of alpha kind of like alphabet

404
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,779
plus like all these special characters

405
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,399
so I think in total it's more than 2,000

406
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:29,860
characters that we're looking at and we

407
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:32,860
don't really want to like and I'll enter

408
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,870
them by hand because we need to we

409
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,850
eventually we want to convert like

410
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,969
something into like Unicode and pipe it

411
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:41,590
into a website so we can just use like

412
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,970
the sprite just the sprite so we want to

413
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,309
convert them into something more useful

414
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:48,610
and we don't really want that to do that

415
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:51,700
by hand so we can like when like an OCR

416
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,949
on on the data so the idea is so that's

417
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,870
the code again so because the font is

418
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,940
fixed with you can like split it in tiny

419
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:00,309
chunks and then like ran like a tool

420
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,659
that's going to recognize it's meant for

421
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:04,299
like quicken is like handwriting or

422
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:07,870
something and so that's kind of like the

423
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:09,908
output of it so it's it's like a little

424
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,529
forty sometimes but it's saved a lot of

425
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:13,240
time because I really don't want to type

426
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:15,120
like 2,000 characters and by hand and

427
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,590
like try to recognize which is which so

428
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,080
yeah and I was saying just before

429
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:22,059
something is also missing it's in this

430
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,029
spreadsheet we have we've seen three but

431
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:27,309
is like a few more so where are those I

432
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:29,380
looked for awhile and I couldn't find

433
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:32,470
them and I was kind of frustrated so I

434
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,679
was like well the game knows so we're

435
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:38,020
just going to dump them like PlayStation

436
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,500
is like a VM that you can recycle just

437
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:43,000
like the graphic memory and if it's

438
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,760
printing the characters it must be in

439
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,340
the VM at some point so we can just like

440
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,270
dumb the VM

441
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:54,209
so yeah and that's what you get so it's

442
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:56,310
a little blurry here but we can see that

443
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,870
that's like some of this thing we were

444
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,460
like looking before but on the left side

445
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,350
is like this we like it's appreciate

446
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:06,720
that were like missing so here's like

447
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:10,260
with more like like that's like more

448
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,800
progress with like all the all the

449
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:20,520
characters like being like implemented

450
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:23,580
so we've sorry so now we got like

451
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,960
everything and we ready to send the data

452
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,500
back into like a web browser or

453
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,990
something and then like use the online

454
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,450
dictionary so let's build it here's like

455
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:37,920
a little like crappy diagram of how I

456
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:40,380
built that so like we're going to

457
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,570
collect WebSocket server that talk with

458
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,280
the Python code and Firefox will connect

459
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,600
to the WebSocket server and get the data

460
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:51,480
and then like we catch on is going to

461
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:55,169
translate that for us so the code just

462
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,700
going to skip it and let's try to do a

463
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:02,940
demo hopefully everything is going to

464
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:08,480
work so this is like some of my debug

465
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:11,700
view and this is the game and here's

466
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,170
firefox that's not to create interface

467
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,890
but that's it so we connect the

468
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,080
WebSockets

469
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:19,890
you can see on the bottom it says that

470
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:25,620
the connection was established and so if

471
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:27,660
we see hi to the guys we can see here on

472
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,870
the left that the text is like showing

473
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,640
up in the WebSocket and the guide

474
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:36,399
Chinese running so we can be like how

475
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:47,289
what this one mean you know and

476
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:50,239
so thank you so yeah and we can like

477
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:52,850
keep playing them very sexy like a few

478
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,000
like glitches where like some characters

479
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:58,428
miss recognized and so on but uh it's uh

480
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,649
it's it's like it's pretty good and uh

481
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:02,779
it's nice like if you want to learn like

482
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:05,299
how I do how you see like purse or

483
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:10,669
something like that it does the thing so

484
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:14,509
yeah that's kind of the idea yeah so uh

485
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:22,909
yeah I think winning at one time so do

486
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:24,559
you have like any questions so to be

487
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:27,159
honest like I made it and then I was
