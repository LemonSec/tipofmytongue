1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,370
hi I'm Tibbs and this is how I imagined

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,209
myself in monster form when I'm on stage

3
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:27,430
to avoid any kind of nerves so if you

4
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,119
would like to also imagine me as a

5
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,800
monster

6
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,860
go ahead it makes us much more

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,620
comfortable and currently I work with a

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,480
large blue chip company doing security

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,379
assessments of open source projects

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,150
based here in Oregon and at 24 I left a

11
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,890
career to attend university for the

12
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,019
first time to study computer science

13
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,659
sorry computer security forensics and

14
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:52,350
ethical hacking and the career that I

15
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:55,600
left was in the HR industry and perhaps

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,519
because of that social engineering is a

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,250
particular point of fascination for me

18
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:02,739
and oddly I use the skills that I

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:06,909
learned in HR more in this job than I

20
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:12,580
did in that one also

21
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:16,090
I love Supernatural um being as it's

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,890
near Halloween and mildly thematic this

23
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:22,060
whole talk will be full of supernatural

24
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:24,369
pictures so some of you might not be

25
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,939
fans and that's okay we all have our

26
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:30,609
flaws but I ask that you indulge me on

27
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:33,850
this because it's mildly relevant and

28
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:35,740
this picture isn't showing and the show

29
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,320
is full of great in social engineering

30
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:46,990
examples so try watching it just for

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:52,139
that also what this guy says and my

32
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:55,839
slides are not going there we go

33
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,460
so the answer might seem obvious but I

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,740
want you all to just take a moment to

35
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,740
ask yourself if you distill social

36
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,749
engineering down to its most basic form

37
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,689
what is it

38
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:09,519
now I know what you're thinking but

39
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:12,160
being a convincing liar is only one part

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,810
of the process there's a lot more to

41
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,970
social engineering than simple is when

42
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,310
you get really under the hood social

43
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,400
engineers search for the weak points in

44
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,340
the fabrics of societal norms to exploit

45
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,780
people in that society and to be truly

46
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,220
successful at this it takes at least

47
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,140
cursory knowledge

48
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,300
of a number of disciplines like

49
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:35,019
philosophy psychology sociology

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:37,930
anthropology body language even sales

51
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,900
and marketing each of which you could

52
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,640
dedicate a lifetime of study to and

53
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,230
still only understand a small part of

54
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,910
I'm not advocating that you go out and

55
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,959
spend the rest of your life trying to

56
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,590
master these because it would be

57
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,790
impossible to do it all but it's

58
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,790
important to understand at least a

59
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,709
little bit about them the question that

60
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:00,880
I get a lot is where do you start where

61
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:02,230
do you where do you dig in and normally

62
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,880
I would say start with what interests

63
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,299
you the most start with what you think

64
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,740
you want to learn and go from there but

65
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,570
since we're all here and I have this

66
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:18,460
talk on social contracts let's start

67
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:20,890
with that in three in 399 BC going back

68
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,050
just a little ways Socrates was put on

69
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:27,369
trial for two things moral corruption

70
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:30,310
and impiety the trial itself is really

71
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,560
interesting and I would advocate that

72
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,810
you all read about it but the outcome is

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,150
what's important here and the outcome

74
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:41,500
was Socrates was convicted and sentenced

75
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:43,260
to death by hemlock poison Plato who was

76
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,400
a student of Socrates at the time

77
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,920
records that Socrates had both the

78
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,720
opportunity and the means to escape his

79
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,700
sentence

80
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,190
however despite encouragement from his

81
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:58,660
friends and his students Socrates chose

82
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:00,730
to stay and to die he refused to leave

83
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,160
because it wouldn't mean leaving what he

84
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,738
saw as his legal responsibility to

85
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,079
Athens he believed that having lived

86
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:10,690
there he voluntarily subjected himself

87
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,670
to this possibility and to run away

88
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,530
would be to break the social contract

89
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:18,548
that he made with the state and its

90
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:21,070
people now the story is really

91
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:25,299
interesting but it leaves us with a

92
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:27,730
question we're aware of explicit

93
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,150
contracts employment contracts loan

94
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,950
agreements marriage these are contracts

95
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,479
that we knowingly negotiate and enter

96
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:39,039
some better than others and in contrast

97
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,199
social contracts provide a framework for

98
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,930
how society and governments in our

99
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,090
and in Socrates own words there an

100
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,490
agreement between people of the society

101
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:53,049
to abide by laws and accept the

102
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:54,699
punishment now many philosophers

103
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,400
throughout history have expanded

104
00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:01,120
Socrates social contract theory socrates

105
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,770
Hobbes Locke and Rousseau may have all

106
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,470
argued if you'd put them in the same

107
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,229
room may have argued on this semantics

108
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,389
but they all agreed that we who live in

109
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:13,719
a society implicitly and sometimes

110
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:15,550
unknowingly agree to and agree to enact

111
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,160
and expect the completion of these

112
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,979
social contracts when they were

113
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,110
developing these theories morality and

114
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:25,990
politics were thought to be interlinked

115
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,850
and to some extent they still are rulers

116
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,830
were there to govern fairly and the

117
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,260
people were there to help the society in

118
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,050
which they lived social contracts are

119
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,010
not just and an agreement between a

120
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,229
people in their government though

121
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:41,530
they're also an agreement of all the

122
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:44,199
people within us is within us ie with

123
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,388
each other so they also form the

124
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,449
unspoken rules that govern play society

125
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:54,310
and maintain civility in the absence of

126
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:56,949
the direct application of law often born

127
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,840
of religious beliefs and morals these

128
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:01,780
rules are the glue by which society is

129
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,780
held together often we think of them as

130
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,820
doing what is polite or maybe what the

131
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,250
right thing such as tipping your

132
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,830
waitstaff or holding the door open for

133
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,360
someone who has their hands full or not

134
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:19,270
standing too close to somebody at the

135
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:22,360
ATM psychology couches the subject in

136
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,039
the concept of moral development moral

137
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,289
development is the stages of moral

138
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:29,050
reasoning that people go through as we

139
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:30,729
turn from children into adults this

140
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,830
looks at how people justify their

141
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,770
behaviors rather than a ranking of how

142
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,530
moral someone's behavior is now these

143
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,060
stages are grouped into three levels and

144
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,359
the stages of development can't be

145
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:46,990
skipped you have to start the process

146
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:51,250
and move through each of them to get to

147
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:53,440
the next so levels one and two are the

148
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,660
preconventional stages and these are

149
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,820
normally seen in children

150
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,710
levels three and four our conventional

151
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,830
stages these are normally seen in

152
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,780
adolescents and adults and levels five

153
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,240
and six at the top are the post

154
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,520
conventional stages these are marked by

155
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,310
a growing understanding the individuals

156
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,380
are separate from the part of a society

157
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,170
and people at this stage of development

158
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:22,390
view rules as being useful but

159
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:23,770
changeable so we're talking about

160
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:26,740
something here that's really intuitive

161
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,570
to humanity as human as humanity

162
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,230
actually evolved out of the primordial

163
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,930
muck

164
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:35,680
our brains developed to foster and

165
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:37,510
indulge social behavior but most people

166
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,310
don't ever examine the workings of their

167
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:42,210
society in the ways that we're talking

168
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:45,250
about here but social engineers should

169
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,020
along with subterfuge social engineers

170
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,690
need to have the tools to understand the

171
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:53,320
society and the culture of the target

172
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:55,600
that they're trying to manipulate we

173
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,099
understand that social contracts we

174
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,590
understand the social contracts that

175
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,230
underlie our own society because we're

176
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,869
part of them so we just grow up knowing

177
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,630
these things but what about other

178
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,490
societies I mean when I moved from

179
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,000
Scotland to America I immediately

180
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,870
noticed differences in Scotland all

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,930
socialization resolves around the pub

182
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:18,580
and having a pint everything people go

183
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,040
to the pint at lunch during the work

184
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,560
week people go to the pint go to the pub

185
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,080
after work to socialize with their

186
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,540
co-workers and their friends everything

187
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,969
is done in a pub but even with a huge

188
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,680
beer culture in places like Portland

189
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:35,710
this is just not how things work here in

190
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,839
America also British people love a

191
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:40,270
really good queue and there are strict

192
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,090
unspoken rules surrounding the practice

193
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:46,210
it's really elaborate I was simply

194
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:50,620
unprepared for the chaos that is lining

195
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:53,980
up in America and here I still find it

196
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,080
curious that a lot of guys wait and for

197
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,240
women to go through a door before go

198
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,420
falling them through we just don't do

199
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,870
that in Scotland at all now I could go

200
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,099
on for probably hours if I had a pie tin

201
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,710
my hand about the differences between

202
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,300
Scotland in America

203
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:13,110
and these are two fairly similar

204
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:16,709
cultures I mean we share a language in

205
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,840
theory and and the history to some

206
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:23,010
degree I mean we both really like fried

207
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,780
food so can you imagine trying to carry

208
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,780
out a social engineering attempt in a

209
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:32,010
country that had vastly different social

210
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:33,420
contracts I mean what what would it be

211
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,780
like to try and do a social engineering

212
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,339
attempt in China or Russia where things

213
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,770
are very different than they are here or

214
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,020
in Scotland research is really important

215
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:47,069
not just of your target themselves but

216
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:48,689
the culture in which they live how do

217
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,890
social contracts work in an environment

218
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,620
where people are coming from different

219
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,030
languages and societies where the people

220
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,080
interacting don't all know the same

221
00:09:54,030 --> 00:10:01,380
unspoken rules like the internet unlike

222
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:05,700
someone unless someone that explicitly

223
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,620
creates and enforces rules it's chaos as

224
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,360
I said like the internet it's it's a

225
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,250
hodgepodge and everyone kind of just

226
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,440
does what they want to do unless they

227
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,300
want to be part of a community in which

228
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,900
they have to follow those community set

229
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,849
rules small groups form rules for their

230
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:24,030
own websites or message boards or spaces

231
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:26,820
but the Internet at large is lawless and

232
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,319
a lack of physical space makes it a lot

233
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,200
easier for people to behave in ways that

234
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:36,810
they wouldn't in real life like trolling

235
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:38,730
or daxing social engineering relies on

236
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:41,579
subverting the social contracts of a

237
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,590
given society and it works because

238
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,450
social engineers explain own weaknesses

239
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,220
within those contracts to encourage

240
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,350
people to fulfill their social side of

241
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,040
the contract even when it's against

242
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:55,050
their best interests we all know

243
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,089
phishing attacks I mean if you don't

244
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,479
you're probably in the right place to

245
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:02,070
learn honestly they're probably the most

246
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,530
prominent and common example of social

247
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:07,980
engineering that we currently have it's

248
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,720
so common because it works because the

249
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,070
creators of the technology used to

250
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,350
carrying out phishing attacks did not

251
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,510
consider how people might subvert that

252
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,570
technology and use it against the users

253
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:21,210
they were trying to help and enable how

254
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,930
different would email look if it was

255
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,220
built now No

256
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:28,170
we know how different would texting look

257
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:33,899
these are the things that we need to

258
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:37,099
think about I know of a company here in

259
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,360
Portland who a couple years back

260
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,450
actually got hit really badly by a

261
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,500
social engineer you probably didn't know

262
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,880
that's what he was doing he probably

263
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,170
just thought he was a scammer but he

264
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,029
came into the building talked to

265
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,790
reception and convinced reception that

266
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:55,320
he was a workman who was supposed to be

267
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,449
there doing a legitimate building work

268
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,390
but that he'd lost his temporary pass

269
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:02,520
and oh man this was the second time and

270
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:06,630
if his boss found out oh he was Anna

271
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:09,660
loses job and so the person on reception

272
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,760
wanting to be helpful and friendly gave

273
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,469
him a new temporary pass and said just

274
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,990
you know bring the old one back when you

275
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,810
find it well it turns out the guy wasn't

276
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:21,870
a workman he just was someone chance in

277
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:24,510
their arm and he got in and over the

278
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,170
course of a weekend he stole several

279
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,270
hundred

280
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,620
I'm sorry several tens of thousands of

281
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:33,870
dollars worth of hardware and equipment

282
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:36,450
and that's not counting the intellectual

283
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:40,790
property that was on the hard drives of

284
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:48,959
that equipment so social engineering is

285
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:49,980
this weird situation where people get

286
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,469
people to act against their own

287
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,300
interests without realizing it another

288
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,370
example of social engineering on a grand

289
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,579
scale that we're facing right now is

290
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:01,560
fake news in theory organizations who

291
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,810
report news should be neutral and report

292
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,150
just the facts

293
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,709
over the last decade or few decades

294
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:10,260
really and this has developed into

295
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:12,420
providing selective truths adding a bias

296
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,270
to stories reported or choosing not to

297
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,610
report stories that don't support I

298
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,020
chose a narrative and in the last few

299
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,839
years this has progressed to reporting

300
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,970
outright fabrications as news these

301
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,079
stories are picked up and spread and

302
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,130
become kind of this consensus news that

303
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,599
everybody just knows if you ever found

304
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,980
one of those news stories that when you

305
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,510
try and follow the trail of where it

306
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,570
came from it just kind of circulates

307
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,189
back around

308
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,510
in this weird circle from website to

309
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:42,610
website back to the original website

310
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:44,020
that you found it on and when these

311
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:47,020
stories are repeated by people in

312
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,930
positions of power they lend the stories

313
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,150
credence and gravitas and the truthiness

314
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,640
of these stories is not the point

315
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:56,550
however news outlets have always

316
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,350
purported to tell the news as it happens

317
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,990
they're twisting or breaking the social

318
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,350
contracts that are expected and this

319
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,400
causes people that that have

320
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,470
historically caused people to trust them

321
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,329
and the purple purpose behind this as

322
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,090
with any other social engineering

323
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:17,740
attempt is to get people to act in a way

324
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:20,260
that they maybe normally wouldn't so to

325
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,410
recap social contracts underlie society

326
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,240
all societies without them societies

327
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,550
would collapse we would have chaos and

328
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,310
Anarchy which might be interesting for a

329
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,410
short while but still we have people who

330
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:36,280
return routinely subvert these unwritten

331
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:38,170
rules for their own benefit so what what

332
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,610
does this mean for us as security

333
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:44,800
professionals and developers of

334
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:47,200
technology being aware and understanding

335
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,229
the oddities of human behavior gives us

336
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,350
a tremendous opportunity an opportunity

337
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:56,260
to do what we are uniquely qualified to

338
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:58,540
do to look at new technologies and how

339
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,670
people should interact with them and

340
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,760
then find the vulnerabilities of how

341
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,319
people might interact with them to find

342
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,050
the ways that people can exploit the

343
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,860
technologies and not just technically

344
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:13,270
but socially as well we also have an

345
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,800
opportunity to highlight these

346
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:18,699
discoveries to the creator's the

347
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,530
curators and the users so my call of

348
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:25,030
action to you if you're still listening

349
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:26,829
is break stuff but don't just break it

350
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,350
technically look at how you can break it

351
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,820
socially talk about it work with

352
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,710
creators to find better ways to

353
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,620
facilitate people to interact with

354
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:38,140
emerging emerging technology and plug

355
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,760
the social gaps and make them make the

356
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,990
world a better place

357
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:47,480
also watch more supernatural

358
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:49,190
so you have all been very quiet and very

359
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,750
attentive and I really appreciate that

360
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,910
I'd like to thank you for being a great

361
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,250
audience and I'd like to thank besides

362
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:59,890
for having me today

363
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,890
do you like Dean have any questions

364
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,650
great well thank you very much

365
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,130
and if you come up with something I'll

366
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,130
