1
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,540
what are some of the types of social

2
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,490
engineering attacks that we've seen so

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,099
you've seen all the traditional attacks

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,150
right you've seen the impersonation

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,290
tailgating tailgating is still a problem

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,810
today right we haven't fixed that

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,788
problem yet shoulders surf reading

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,919
dumpster diving and then some of the

9
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,390
stuff we see more today right the

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,290
fishing machines machine anything that

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,910
ends with ing basically and then you

12
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,710
know I did my own little branding here I

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:46,648
don't know why it's doing that it is

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,160
yeah I'll push on my connections and see

15
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,000
if that helps at all I got a lot of

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,000
connections up here

17
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:05,610
well if you could see that that would

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,750
say you know it's my special branding

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,140
for what we're gonna expect in the

20
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,720
future

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,500
and you're seeing some of this already

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,759
and one of the things is social media

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,050
impersonation so we're seeing the bad

24
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,020
guys are out there they're creating

25
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,700
Twitter accounts and you know you go to

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,979
a company maybe you experienced some

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,899
poor customer service and you're in the

28
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,160
lineup for an hour and you tweet to them

29
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:27,990
you say hey this is no good I really

30
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,899
don't like this you get a tweet back

31
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,179
from who you think is them and they say

32
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:35,190
hey no problem just send us your account

33
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:36,630
name and we'll give you a credit and so

34
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,789
they start harvesting your credentials

35
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,539
so they're really setting up fake

36
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:44,780
accounts in the anticipation to to get

37
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:46,429
that customer service interaction

38
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,899
software-as-a-service

39
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:50,789
for se everybody else is doing it you

40
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,979
can get dial of service attacks now as a

41
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:54,840
service so we're really going to start

42
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,750
to see that ramped up I would expect on

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,550
the private side we see that already on

44
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,190
the nation-state side you've seen the 50

45
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,170
cent army in China and in every other

46
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,819
country really gravitating in that

47
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,050
direction and you know I think you'll

48
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:08,090
see that more and more in the private

49
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,679
space as well

50
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,780
virtual kidnapping so where your

51
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,050
accounts get taken over and there could

52
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,099
be various ways to monetize that maybe

53
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,760
they're just going to held you for

54
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,709
ransom

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,569
one of the areas that I think you're

56
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,849
really going to see huge developments is

57
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,670
whaling and the reason I say that is

58
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,329
because this is these attacks now have

59
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,820
moved for

60
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,890
you know it's cool to do this I can tell

61
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,140
my friends I did it now it's monetized

62
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,420
this big business now right so who holds

63
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,100
the money while your executives right so

64
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,380
they have the authority to transfer

65
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,810
large sums of money so there are gonna

66
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,220
be really bigger targets and I think

67
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,480
there'll be a lot more effort put into

68
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:51,210
that so what's the origin story for this

69
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,519
social engineering stuff right it's it

70
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,470
didn't just occur it's not a new thing

71
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,150
I'm pretty sure the people who built the

72
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,580
pyramids you know I think they're pretty

73
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,410
good at social engineering if you want a

74
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,020
crash course in social engineering just

75
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,640
walk oh no a used-car lot and and wait

76
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,780
and see what happens and that experience

77
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,309
is pretty interesting right you'll have

78
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,810
someone come up to you and they'll go

79
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,580
through this certain script and it won't

80
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,950
be oh what kind of car would you like to

81
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,080
buy it'll really be how much money do

82
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,510
you have to spend right and so it's it's

83
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,370
a very interesting approach they're not

84
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,530
concerned about giving you the best car

85
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,180
they want to extract as much funds as

86
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,880
much money out of you as possible and

87
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,440
give you the least value in most cases I

88
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,950
love doing that I love talking to those

89
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,739
guys so why should we care about social

90
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:41,299
engineering what's the big deal so read

91
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,380
the this charts taken right out of it

92
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,890
that's really distracting I'm glad I'm

93
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,890
not looking at that

94
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:54,049
come on I got to give you something

95
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:07,069
hello okay don't touch it all right so

96
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,659
please say so yeah the Verizon report so

97
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,399
this is a chart and I like to look at

98
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:12,319
charts and I think of charts as stocks

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,670
basically and I extrapolated this this

100
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,619
is not what it's really gonna look like

101
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,810
over several years but just for

102
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,228
visibility you know if we take a look at

103
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,089
this

104
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:22,008
social engineering right that's the

105
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:24,349
superhot stock right now if this was a

106
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:26,150
stock you'd want to buy it we compare

107
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,639
that to some other things right we see

108
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,320
that the physical right that's doing

109
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,120
pretty good probably an ETF maybe not a

110
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,159
big dividend right but you know it's

111
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,380
still not bad not as good as social you

112
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,240
know and then malware that's probably

113
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,889
bonds it's leveled off a little bit and

114
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,120
then what they refer to is hacking I

115
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:42,770
don't remember the definition it's kind

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,210
of generic that's the stock that your

117
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,609
friend recommended which is never a good

118
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,500
idea right so you just look at that and

119
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,970
vendors are saying well it's going up by

120
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,530
20%

121
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,090
whatever that percentage is you could

122
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,280
just eyeball that and you can say that's

123
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,169
pretty steep right and when whatever

124
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,508
attacks you're looking at most of them

125
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:01,370
have started off at least as a social

126
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,380
engineering attack whether it be fishing

127
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,659
or fishing or whatever it was right so

128
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,090
it's usually and especially the oesn't

129
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:09,620
is usually that first stage of an attack

130
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,760
if you see people looking at all your

131
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,680
stuff doing Osen

132
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,590
well that next step is probably going to

133
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,870
be something a little more serious so

134
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,609
that's why we should care the OSI model

135
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,930
I always like to poke fun at the OSI

136
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,949
model any of you have done an exam

137
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,990
lately you're probably pretty familiar

138
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:25,430
with this we don't typically look at it

139
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,139
on a day-to-day level but the

140
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,180
interesting thing is it only focuses on

141
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,740
the technical right so the joke is let's

142
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,080
add that user layer on top of that

143
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,690
because I'm not gonna spend a ton of

144
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,669
time trying to hack your firewall if all

145
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,070
I have to do is phone your user base and

146
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:42,620
say hey what's your password and they

147
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,380
will give it to me right so five minutes

148
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,210
later all right

149
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,400
so kevin Mitnick had the pleasure of

150
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,489
meeting him in Vegas this year amazing

151
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,049
person his books are fantastic you know

152
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,430
he had this great quote the weakest link

153
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,610
in the security chain is the human

154
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:01,250
element I believe in that personally

155
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,889
after my experience is there anybody in

156
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,659
the room or do you all feel that maybe

157
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:07,460
that's not the case do you think that

158
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:08,360
maybe social engineering is really not

159
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,310
that big of a deal

160
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,850
not that big of a threat

161
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,700
are we drinking the kool-aid yeah okay

162
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:19,610
do you want to do a quick demo to see if

163
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,830
you could be socially engineered yeah

164
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,630
it's worth the time two minutes okay so

165
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,430
let's do a trick real quick this is a

166
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,100
cheap trick you will not like me

167
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,320
afterwards especially if I trick you so

168
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,550
you know full disclosure okay so let's

169
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,380
do something real quick let's pretend

170
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,600
we're a company we're all working in

171
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,300
some big company we're awesome we're

172
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,100
making widgets and I'm the info SEC

173
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,370
persons just one of me so I'm just full

174
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,930
out and I got to do some policy on stuff

175
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,760
you shouldn't be doing so my executives

176
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,710
said they're sick and tired are you

177
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,539
doing this thing like I'll say something

178
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,549
easy like let's say hand flipping right

179
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,100
you're not allowed to hand flip hand

180
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,240
flip is a fireable offense okay

181
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,790
everybody got that

182
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,350
don't flip your hands okay don't do that

183
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,400
I'll gonna do something like dancing but

184
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,190
I don't think anybody you're gonna want

185
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,960
to dance so so no hand flipping that's

186
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,340
the rule it's in policy okay you've all

187
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,200
read the policy of course right because

188
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,190
everybody reads all the policies okay so

189
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,080
let's do this all right

190
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,880
and I need full participation for this

191
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,719
okay let's put your hands out in front

192
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,490
of you like zombies yeah thank you very

193
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,340
much I appreciate that okay so we're

194
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,830
gonna start with our hands up okay

195
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,289
busted

196
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,750
see I told you I told you it was a cheap

197
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:31,370
trick but that's basically how social

198
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,080
engineering works right like you're told

199
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,360
not to do something and then I kind of

200
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,159
put you in this weird position you know

201
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,229
where you do it right maybe not the best

202
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,639
example but it just kind of shows that

203
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,680
everybody can be socially engineered

204
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,539
everybody ends up clicking on that link

205
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,729
and those emails are not even that good

206
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:48,289
yet wait til they're good right they're

207
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:51,110
getting better for sure so I'm sorry

208
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:52,669
okay I'm sorry about everybody has that

209
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:57,590
different look at this point in the

210
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:59,810
presentation I'm sorry that idea I

211
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,638
ripped off from somebody so if anybody

212
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,050
remembers where I got that idea from

213
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,879
I've tweaked it a little bit I think

214
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,669
I've made it better but let me know

215
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,229
because I have no idea where that's from

216
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,609
so if you're still doubt the power of

217
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:13,520
social engineer and just go google it

218
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:17,060
right most of most attacks start at that

219
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,590
place either OSINT or pho NSC all right

220
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,300
so a little bit about DEFCON who's been

221
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,219
to DEFCON

222
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,919
holy smokes okay who wants to go to

223
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:26,180
DEFCON okay good I was really hoping

224
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:28,159
there'd be as many hands on the second

225
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,740
round they're good okay so I've been at

226
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,390
DEFCON twice first year I went there you

227
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,950
know you buy your ticket for blackhat if

228
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,049
you're going through a company and you

229
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,060
could get kind of DEFCON on the side and

230
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,740
you avoid the lineup and it's kind of

231
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,059
like you know when I first did that it's

232
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,919
like okay well I'm a good blackhat and

233
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:45,290
then oh yeah maybe I'll go to DEFCON so

234
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,149
I I went through the first year and you

235
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,640
come out of blackhat and it's you know

236
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:51,589
you wake up you go have breakfast you go

237
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,569
to some talks you have a lunch you go to

238
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,500
some talks you go and party and then you

239
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,020
just rinse and repeat

240
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,180
right DEFCON is not like that they don't

241
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,079
have lunch right so no one's holding

242
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,180
your hand

243
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:03,500
no one's going over this way sir right

244
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,060
it's really you just do whatever you

245
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,709
want to do there's talk so you can go

246
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,750
out in the desert and shoot guns

247
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:10,040
there's the villages CTF there's

248
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,170
whatever you want to do so it's really

249
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,449
whatever you want to make of it people

250
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,800
call it a conference I don't think it's

251
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:18,260
really a conference anymore I think it's

252
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,420
a series of conferences and a whole

253
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,709
bunch of other stuff and you know I got

254
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,899
the feeling when I was there it's more

255
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,250
like Burning Man and in a conference

256
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,779
right if you read the ten principles of

257
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,459
Burning Man you kind of understand what

258
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,949
I'm talking about but definitely worth

259
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:32,149
your time it's a couple hundred bucks

260
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:33,319
great value but it's whatever you make

261
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:35,870
of it I brought a guy from work this

262
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,100
year he went there different experience

263
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,300
because he didn't really know what to

264
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,590
expect and

265
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,359
it can be a little bit overwhelming so

266
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:44,690
if you're gonna go kind of plan what you

267
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,520
want to do so I saw the su village when

268
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,650
I was there I spent a few minutes at

269
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,930
every every little stationed at every

270
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,100
CTF or every village and I went in there

271
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,229
and saw these people phoning these

272
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,880
companies phoning actual companies and

273
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,080
getting points so well that's pretty

274
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,120
cool I'd love to do that

275
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,350
so I thought okay well I'll apply for

276
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,870
that right that's gonna be my plan of

277
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,390
attack for this year I'm gonna apply but

278
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,680
hundreds of people apply so how am I

279
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,449
going to get in there well and they're

280
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,770
the people that apply are really skilled

281
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,630
there's a lot of talented people at Def

282
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,439
Con how am I gonna get in there so I

283
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,110
thought well okay I'll make an

284
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,730
interesting video right and like

285
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,830
everybody life gets in the way I didn't

286
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:21,260
have a lot of time so I made a video I

287
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,300
don't know if I'd call it interesting it

288
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,160
was really creepy you can go and watch

289
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,490
it it's not great it's just really

290
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,270
spooky crazy weird but I get I guess

291
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,600
that's what they were looking for

292
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:34,310
because they said yeah Rob come on in so

293
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,990
that was good for about five minutes I

294
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,119
was pretty excited and then I realized

295
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,190
holy crap I'm gonna be in a room in

296
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,300
front of hundreds of people for 20

297
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,480
minutes and I have to perform

298
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,729
so goodbye weakens weekends and evenings

299
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,130
I spent about a hundred hours prepping

300
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,930
for this which sounds ridiculous and I

301
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,750
guess it was it was quite addictive I

302
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:56,300
was a total novice so some of the areas

303
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,370
for me that burned a lot of time was how

304
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,410
do I collect data how do I store data

305
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,390
how do I organize this data because if

306
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,890
you have a thousand data points and

307
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,840
you're trying to make sense that and

308
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,939
you're not really used to doing that it

309
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,520
takes a bit of time to do that so so

310
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,690
that was interesting I learned a ton so

311
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,550
if you want to learn if you wanna go

312
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,990
take a course or something and and get a

313
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,780
crash course in any of these areas

314
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,520
things like this at these conferences

315
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,430
the CTFs are a great way to do that I

316
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:26,060
can't emphasize that enough

317
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:27,410
so the CTF is basically two stages you

318
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,390
have your first stage which is three

319
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,790
weeks at home in your pajamas doing

320
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:34,370
OSINT there are sixteen people that

321
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,390
could participate so 16 competitors and

322
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,850
you start following them on Twitter

323
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:39,470
looking at what they're doing everybody

324
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,390
has their own target so what's a real

325
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,250
company and it's part of a common

326
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,830
industry so this year it was the gaming

327
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,450
industry and which was cool because I

328
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,160
have some of the games of the company

329
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,290
that I targeted which made me feel a

330
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,040
little bit weird but but it was alright

331
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,860
I got to know them

332
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,110
really well and you have 29 flags to

333
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,540
capture and work different points

334
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:02,480
depending on the quality of the flag so

335
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,920
what's your SSID is worth more than oh

336
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,410
how long have you been working for the

337
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,209
company no engagement so you're allowed

338
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,399
to phone the company but I'm not allowed

339
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:12,410
to talk to them so I just can confirm

340
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,899
the phone number works and that's really

341
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:18,380
prepping me for stage 2 which is your 20

342
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:20,000
minutes phishing live at DEFCON and

343
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,259
there's echoes over two days they're

344
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,360
gonna either go to Friday or Saturday

345
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:24,949
and the winner really is the one that

346
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,430
captures the most flags or the most

347
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:30,680
points hence CTF so you can get the same

348
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,899
points that you collected during the

349
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,489
OSINT and you but for the vision you can

350
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,810
get up multiple times depending on how

351
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,060
many people you phone so if iPhone

352
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,250
person a and get all the flags that can

353
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,160
then do the same thing on person B not

354
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,449
person number letter but anyway so you

355
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,829
can repeat it over and over again and

356
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:47,508
some people just go for the big flags

357
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:49,930
like please go to this website and they

358
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:52,100
just keep doing that over and over again

359
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,589
all right this is the flags I don't

360
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,440
expect you to be able to read that but

361
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:59,120
basically there's things like you know

362
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,110
do you have a cafeteria

363
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,430
what's your VPN janitorial service OS 10

364
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,660
year how long have you worked there for

365
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:10,370
so those are some of the common ones

366
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,310
then starting my OSINT because it's a

367
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:15,350
corporation LinkedIn was your my friend

368
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:18,010
right it's just amazing how much you can

369
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,940
just collect from that alone for

370
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,439
individuals you want to go a little bit

371
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,569
differently but since my target was

372
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,850
corporate great starting point because

373
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,889
not only is it very well laid out but

374
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,740
they've given me some really key

375
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:31,730
indicators right tenure what they

376
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,800
specialize in

377
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,300
what department they're in so you can

378
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,109
start to kind of group those departments

379
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,639
I had multiple offices and locations so

380
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,819
I could find out what location these

381
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,589
people were in then also there's links

382
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:46,579
to their other social media which is

383
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:49,459
great too I don't even have to go

384
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:51,199
hunting for it right it's all there with

385
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:52,939
LinkedIn if you send me an invite on

386
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,359
LinkedIn say hey Rob can you join my

387
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:56,480
LinkedIn

388
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,939
I will accept why because it just

389
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,160
expands my search range right which is

390
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:03,370
which is fantastic LinkedIn will try to

391
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,540
make you buy a membership at some point

392
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,820
and as you limit out

393
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,319
your search capabilities on there and

394
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,850
you could do that I was determined not

395
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,250
to do that so there's a tool called

396
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,959
Linkedin x-ray which is a great tool and

397
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,820
it will allow you to kind of search the

398
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,979
whole area get much wider results

399
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:22,339
without having to pay so I'd highly

400
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,319
recommend you take a look at that so

401
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:25,639
once you're going through the company

402
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:28,550
you're gonna get a lot of people that

403
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,440
you could go deep on kind of the 8020

404
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,209
rule of course though it 20% of those

405
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,620
people are gonna be the social

406
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:35,300
butterflies that are gonna put

407
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,889
everything out on the internet right

408
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,560
they're gonna be putting your VPN

409
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:42,529
information out there so really I

410
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,060
focused on those people and also their

411
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:46,189
friends because they go out with their

412
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,410
friends and their friends takes pictures

413
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:51,110
of of their stuff right of their laptop

414
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,000
and things like that so really focusing

415
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,250
on that go into their personal websites

416
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,870
which were just fantastic they'd have

417
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:02,329
their resume you know home home address

418
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:04,699
cell phone number what technologies they

419
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:06,079
use so that was really really helpful as

420
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:07,490
well so you don't want to look at

421
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,269
everybody because that'll just burn way

422
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,709
too much time so I was a novice when I

423
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:14,720
started this I'm you know I still

424
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:17,239
classify myself as a novice compared to

425
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,839
many of you but so when I was out there

426
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,800
doing my OSINT hunting these people

427
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,230
unlinked in you know when someone looks

428
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,430
at your profile you you wonder who was

429
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,079
that why are they looking at my profile

430
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,670
so then you go and look at their profile

431
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:31,219
well if you do that to a few hundred

432
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:33,139
people and they all start looking at

433
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,639
your profile so I noticed that after

434
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:36,649
about a week into it in which which

435
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,260
point it was too late so then I was like

436
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:40,910
oh dear that could go really bad right

437
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,920
because all I have to do is say hey did

438
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,569
rob say look at your profile yeah he

439
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,310
looked at my - and then you know could

440
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,540
be game over there so many of you

441
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,040
probably already have some of these

442
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,540
solutions in place if you're doing this

443
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,120
professionally there's a lot of options

444
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,349
to give you a little more privacy but

445
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,350
yeah don't make the mistake that I made

446
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:02,250
all right so pretext development and

447
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,430
pretext is really kind of your story

448
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:08,130
that you're going with so to develop

449
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,290
those talking to a lot of people over

450
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:13,980
beers hey would you believe me if I did

451
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,660
this or said this so I got rid of a lot

452
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,700
of pretext through that because at first

453
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,380
you're like okay I'm sneaky I'm gonna

454
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,730
have a really sophisticated pretext

455
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,380
right it's gonna have all these bells

456
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,570
and whistles and no get rid of those

457
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,730
right just super simple as simple as

458
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:29,190
possible I started talking to

459
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,560
receptionists receptionist's are golden

460
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,930
for this right because they probably

461
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,339
have kids so they're used to you know

462
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,469
that sort of stuff they used to say no

463
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,180
very politely they're usually super

464
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,690
professional because they deal with cold

465
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,520
calls all day long right and so they

466
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,710
were fantastic I spent hours talking to

467
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,120
receptionist's you know at the end I was

468
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,610
so happy I was buying them chocolate

469
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,140
just for all their help and really your

470
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,090
receptionist's are are kind of your

471
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,660
firewall to your organization right as

472
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:59,220
far as se attacks so I was really happy

473
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,170
to develop those relationships even more

474
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,570
but a lot of my pretexts were vetted

475
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,760
through them and when i went to vegas

476
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,260
they you know the they really helped me

477
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,280
to make sure that I had ones that worked

478
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:14,069
so so then you're going to Vegas and if

479
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,660
you haven't been DEFCON before some some

480
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:17,970
ideas you might want to think about I

481
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,310
choose not to stay in the hotel that's

482
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:23,670
hosting Def Con this year it was Caesars

483
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:25,198
they just changed I can't imagine you

484
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,240
know people that are showing up to Vegas

485
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,180
you know that the sweet couple you know

486
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,340
the in their 60s they come in and they

487
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,260
don't know that there's three security

488
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,959
conventions going on at that time and

489
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,640
they've got their laptop with them you

490
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,200
know I just feel so bad I actually

491
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,730
talked to one couple I said hey by the

492
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,520
way you may will not want to get on the

493
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,810
Wi-Fi why and then I started to tell

494
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,129
them and they just kind of slowly moved

495
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:52,500
away from me so you know I tried right

496
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,580
so you know just you may want to figure

497
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,100
out where you're gonna stay there's the

498
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,439
three conferences right besides the

499
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,510
black hat and DEF CON and you might want

500
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,170
to go to all three or one and but you

501
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,300
got to figure out where you're gonna

502
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,800
stay so that's always a challenge

503
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,810
comfortable shoes so Vegas is brutal

504
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,730
that way right I was doing 10,000 at

505
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,960
least sometimes towards 20,000 steps per

506
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,450
day

507
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,760
everything is through the casino right

508
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,320
so bathroom food whatever you want to do

509
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,899
is through the casino so you're doing a

510
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,450
lot a lot of walking famous Def Con real

511
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:23,610
rights so three hours of sleep two meals

512
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,200
a day and one shower you know it's a

513
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,820
room like this but even more packed

514
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,399
sometimes so there's a level of

515
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:32,210
stinkiness involved sometimes so they

516
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:36,360
ask you to do the hygiene part of it

517
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:38,190
so how did I prioritize my marks right

518
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,360
then this is an important part right

519
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,580
you're gonna have a lot of people to

520
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,620
choose from when you're there I only had

521
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,529
20 minutes and real attackers are gonna

522
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,029
think pretty similar to this right they

523
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:49,620
have a their they have a business that

524
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:52,140
they're running so they don't a waste

525
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,370
time right there they have a lot of

526
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,200
things to do they want to get points

527
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,689
that you want to score right so same

528
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,580
with me so I took a look and I developed

529
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,230
kind of an algorithm for my marks I

530
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,000
wanted like low connection scores on

531
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,110
LinkedIn because that was gonna tell me

532
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,830
that this person's not really

533
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,779
well-connected

534
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,639
they probably don't know a lot of people

535
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,409
in the organization and they probably

536
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,350
don't know the industry that well either

537
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:14,820
so they're not going to be able to go

538
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,490
tell somebody hey this weird guy's

539
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,408
calling me um very easily right so

540
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,110
that's what I'm looking for they're not

541
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:24,000
gonna know what normal looks like

542
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,639
probably rights so this seems kind of

543
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,080
weird they may not detect that then the

544
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,909
next thing is I'm looking for people

545
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,580
that will actually talk to me because

546
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:33,840
it's no good if I phone you and you're

547
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,879
not gonna tell anybody but you're also

548
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,010
not gonna talk to me so I need somebody

549
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,600
who is expressive so those if you're

550
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:43,230
taking a lot of selfies and stuff like

551
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,389
that you know I'm going after you and in

552
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:48,029
your ability to share so if you posted

553
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,100
the VPN configuration on your Facebook

554
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:52,049
then yeah I'm putting your name down on

555
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,928
my list right so basically high charisma

556
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:56,370
low wisdom scores which actually quite

557
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:59,039
often translates into interns and

558
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,229
contractors and you know I think that

559
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:05,309
it's part of the transient transient

560
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:09,149
nature of their business but but that's

561
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:10,830
pretty much who I was targeting that's

562
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:12,389
what the room looks like and I just

563
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,908
thought I'd show you this in case you're

564
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,919
planning to do this it's really exciting

565
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:18,889
being in the booth and when you're in

566
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,840
there like any high-pressure situation

567
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:23,389
you realize that sophistication and

568
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,488
complexity is your enemy

569
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,498
and it you just kind of domed out things

570
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:28,789
down it's like okay this this is simple

571
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:32,179
and it's gonna work and I highly

572
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:33,679
recommend that sort of strategy and

573
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:35,359
you'll see attackers do that too right

574
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,749
there their attacks are pretty pretty

575
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,759
straightforward and pretty simple in the

576
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:43,070
booth the clocks the enemy right so as

577
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:45,829
you're dialing that takes time voicemail

578
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:47,479
takes time no answers take time so that

579
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:50,418
killed 10 minutes of my time right off

580
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:52,549
the bat and so I fell down to my sure

581
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:54,979
bets which was reception so I there was

582
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:56,629
a couple different offices reception at

583
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:59,450
both of them so I spent my time talking

584
00:20:56,629 --> 00:21:01,248
to them some other people had more

585
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,109
sophisticated pretexts where they would

586
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:05,419
talk for a couple minutes to introduce

587
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:07,399
themselves and to talk about why they

588
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:09,379
needed your information and those were

589
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:12,049
doomed to failure because it gives the

590
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:13,998
the mark more time to think about it

591
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:14,719
right does this is a sounding normal is

592
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:18,079
this weird

593
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:20,719
should I ask questions right so I find

594
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,539
good attacks are quick and concise and

595
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:24,979
direct unbelievable right so you want to

596
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:27,529
have something that that sounds legit

597
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:31,059
but don't waste any time on any fluff

598
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:33,529
right you want to really boil it down

599
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:35,749
some some of the general rules right so

600
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:37,159
pictures were okay but no video because

601
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:38,419
they were worried about the audio you in

602
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:39,859
the state of Nevada you have to actually

603
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:41,659
tell the person on the other side of the

604
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:42,859
phone that you're recording and that

605
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:44,629
really would have kind of given it all

606
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:47,149
away and even though the booth is

607
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:48,559
soundproof you know you can actually

608
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:50,779
hear the audience so they try to make

609
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,579
you stay quiet until it's over and then

610
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:54,349
if you do really well everybody jumps up

611
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:57,799
in screams and yells and shouts which is

612
00:21:54,349 --> 00:22:00,320
pretty cool so now we're gonna get into

613
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,119
some of the more interesting stuff some

614
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,489
of the tricks that I used and some of

615
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:08,119
the tricks you'll see attackers use the

616
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:10,489
spirit of the SCC TF is really to not

617
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:13,039
victimize the person so a lot of my

618
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:15,649
tricks were really focused on the good

619
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,749
side right the you know making people

620
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:19,238
feel good as I'm tricking them as

621
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:21,499
opposed to the more aggressive

622
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:24,440
intimidation approaches that you'll see

623
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:26,179
real attackers using I think they could

624
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,009
do better if they use some of the softer

625
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:30,079
approaches actually but they I think for

626
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:31,789
them it's more of a time thing so the

627
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,559
first one is the confirmation if I know

628
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:35,389
you're using Dell laptops based on my

629
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:36,559
own scent I'm not going to ask you if

630
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:37,189
you're using them I want to build that

631
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,320
we

632
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,820
poor by saying well how do you like them

633
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,620
right and then in your mind you're

634
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,090
saying well okay he knows I have them so

635
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,399
that kind of legitimizes our

636
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:49,459
conversation so that'll help that whole

637
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,770
conversation wheels start turning if I

638
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,450
don't know and I use this technique and

639
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,490
it worked it could go wrong so you have

640
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:58,310
to be a bit careful but you could do the

641
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,740
the reverse conformation so I say oh so

642
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,629
you're using Dells are you but you're

643
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,480
using lenovo's so some people will take

644
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:07,550
great pride in correcting you right

645
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,070
which is great no no no no we're using

646
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:13,760
lenovo's right okay good thank you

647
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:16,490
Chuck you know name-dropping I've used

648
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,290
this and this worked and real attackers

649
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,120
don't really use this one too much yet

650
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:24,320
for fish and fishing but I think they

651
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:27,469
will so oh mr. or mrs. Smith your VP of

652
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,850
HR or recommended I talk to you if I

653
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,040
know who that person is I know their

654
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,330
title it sounds legitimate if the rest

655
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,139
of my story sounds good you're probably

656
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:38,360
gonna go for it blowing smoke this one

657
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,790
as well works great I use that as well

658
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,919
you know you were recommended to us

659
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,149
right and you know you feel special as

660
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,060
soon as someone says those words right

661
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:49,580
up me yeah thanks yeah I do have some

662
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,720
good information for you so you know and

663
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,409
that they're you're making the person

664
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,960
feel good some more tricks impending

665
00:23:54,410 --> 00:24:00,590
doom and so this sounds negative I use

666
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,650
this trick it worked and it's really I

667
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,840
used this HVAC example where I said you

668
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,550

670
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,399
inspection of your HVAC hey I just want

671
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,740
to call and see if there's anything we

672
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,900
need to do to get him set up to do that

673
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,310
what what are you talking about yeah

674
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,480
don't you know like we were working with

675
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:19,399
the property management company he's

676
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,720
gonna be there tomorrow and can you use

677
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,220
your cafeteria how about your washroom

678
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,830
does he need to get it use a card to get

679
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,450
in hey can you use your Wi-Fi to upgrade

680
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,100
the firmware as well right so you can

681
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,290
start going in those directions and for

682
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,110
things like physical pen testing this

683
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:35,720
might be good intro aloud to vent

684
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:38,270
everybody likes to vent right and so

685
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,220
this can work pretty well you know my

686
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,560
boss is yelling at me he wants me to get

687
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,330
this done you know can you help me out

688
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,679
and sometimes if you can get them to

689
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,919
vent a little bit you can start to build

690
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,800
to develop that relationship smarty

691
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,380
pants you know how did you ever figure

692
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,930
oh thanks so much this works great too I

693
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,880
try to work this in to every pretext

694
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,160
right to really thank them to be very

695
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:04,420
courteous people tend to respect that a

696
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,520
lot I find zero-sum okay agreed this is

697
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,690
used by the bad guys quite a bit right

698
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,820
you've probably seen this quite a bit

699
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,340
very usually it's that time sensitive

700
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:15,490
thing so somebody's gonna get this thing

701
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:18,520
of value it might as well be you so you

702
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,870
know quick click the link right giving

703
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,460
you that pressure we did a phishing

704
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:23,020
program and we found the time sensitive

705
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,390
ones worked actually quite well it

706
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,070
triggers people to take action so

707
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,560
whatever you can do to get them to stop

708
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:33,460
thinking about it right just do it you

709
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:35,350
know sympathy this works great as well

710
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:38,200
real attackers don't use this very much

711
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:40,540
but I think they should you know I'm new

712
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,800
at this you know can you help me out you

713
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,080
know I've been trying to do this it's my

714
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,610
first day on the job my boss is gonna be

715
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,659
so mad if I screw this up

716
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,659
right who's not going to help that

717
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:52,660
person right and I find so that worked

718
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:55,150
quite well as well so now we'll get into

719
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:59,680
my pretext and so these pretext use a

720
00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:01,570
lot of those tricks um and because a lot

721
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,100
of times you'll get stuck at reception

722
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:06,820
if you don't have the people's dids

723
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:08,909
direct inward dial and so I anticipated

724
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,200
getting caught up in reception and I did

725
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:15,850
not because I didn't have their D IDs I

726
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,900
did I took all of that other PBX but but

727
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,850
it was good you're gonna you're probably

728
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,790
going to hit reception and and and there

729
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:23,080
are masters at detecting BS right so I

730
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,760
want to really make sure I was ready for

731
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,939
them so these were designed to kind of

732
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:30,580
get through that front door you know so

733
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,220
spoofing the university or college that

734
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,379
some of their employees go to their

735
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,730
interns specifically I'm calling in a

736
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,530
reception saying hey can I talk to

737
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:41,020
so-and-so he's your intern I'm calling

738
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,399
from the U of whatever and you know we

739
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,950
really want to talk to that person to

740
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,460
help develop our intern program sounds

741
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:50,110
legit right so then once you're in the

742
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,820
receptionist has probably said oh it's

743
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,770
you of whatever they'd like to talk to

744
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,689
you that builds some legitimacy right

745
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,639
and then I introduce myself as that and

746
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,740
then I go through my questions boom boom

747
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,030
boom boom and then at the end I ask them

748
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,130
hey can you transfer me to so-and-so

749
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,270
because they're also a former student or

750
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,220
an intern as well

751
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,720
so now I'm inside and now I'm getting

752
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,630
routed through without having to go back

753
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,059
out and come back in the blue-collar

754
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:16,210
disco so I really like this if you have

755
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:17,139
any knowledge of areas kind of outside

756
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,630
of yours

757
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,130
for me I work with data centers quite a

758
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,440
bit historically so I know a little bit

759
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,300
about HVAC so it'll be able to talk that

760
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,559
language and say you know this is where

761
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,230
Larry's going to come in and do the

762
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,899
servicing I can talk about HVAC s'right

763
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:34,000
and and the person on the other end you

764
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,040
know it sounds legitimate to them right

765
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,730
so if you can throw out those industry

766
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,990
words that really helps as well I did

767
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,260
this one in Vegas and it worked pretty

768
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:46,000
well some targeted methods right so

769
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,429
these are the pretext where you're going

770
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,950
after a very important piece of

771
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:52,660
information which is probably going to

772
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,700
set off some red flags if you're not

773
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,070
extremely careful Mitnick does this

774
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,990
really well you know if you read some of

775
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,600
his books he talks about how he layers

776
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,580
right he goes after the first one and

777
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,379
it's relatively easy it's relatively

778
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,639
benign it's something that you would

779
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,250
look and go why would he need that

780
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,990
information but then you use that for

781
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,460
the next call and then you use the

782
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,320
content you got from that call for the

783
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:17,140
next call and you're just building this

784
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,610
snowball of knowledge right and then

785
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,440
when you get to the you know let's say

786
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,419
the fifth or a sixth college you've got

787
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,610
tons of information to make you sound

788
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,220
like an authority or an internal person

789
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:29,110
so that's what this is all about so the

790
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,640
first one was the enemy of my enemy you

791
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,559
know so I'm calling as a potential

792
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,450
tenant and I'm asking you hey how is it

793
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,309
working in your building what's the

794
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,600
property management like and they're

795
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:38,860
gonna start to tell you about the

796
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,480
different things within their building

797
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,309
and there's a ton of information out

798
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,460
there if you want to learn about a

799
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:47,860
property to take that approach it's

800
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,700
surprising how much is available special

801
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,800
delivery

802
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,630
I use this one it worked pretty well the

803
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,240
script for safe FedEx or any of the

804
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,860
couriers is pretty well known and so you

805
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,770
can get the receptionist to talk to you

806
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,300
a little bit with that sort of call yeah

807
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:03,400
can I tell you a secret

808
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,320
everybody likes secrets right I've never

809
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,350
ran into anybody who said no to this

810
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,909
question so I'm calling as a recruiter

811
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,740
my company's gonna lay off some people

812
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,780
and I'm trying to find a new home for

813
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,490
them and you don't

814
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,260
to help them out and so I'm calling

815
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,700
companies like yours because they'd like

816
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,980
to you know work at a company like yours

817
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,450
and I just need to answer you'd answer a

818
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,340
couple questions they have like you know

819
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,650
how's your cafeteria you know stuff like

820
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,720
that and they usually get a bonus for

821
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,850
recruiting and so they're probably

822
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,680
thinking about that so this question is

823
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,909
usually pretty exciting for them because

824
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,520
you're gonna give them qualified

825
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:37,500
candidates um so this is another good

826
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,850
one right it's that that greed emotion

827
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:44,550
greed factor the full dumps these are

828
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:47,129
great if you can get somebody lined up

829
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:49,350
to do this right you're gonna go in the

830
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:51,780
radio station contest I mean any sort of

831
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:54,090
contests it's so overused now real

832
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,350
attackers gravitate towards this you

833
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,879
know how many times you get the call on

834
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,760
your cell phone congratulations you've

835
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,100
won a cruise right it's so I didn't use

836
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,990
that one it was on my list but you know

837
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,909
it's just so overused the upgrade

838
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:08,490
opportunity so many of you probably work

839
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:10,680
with vendors right when you have a new

840
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,880
account rep how does that work right

841
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,200
somebody just calls you out of the blue

842
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,940
and says hey I'm your new account rep

843
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,830
how you doing right there's no real

844
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,420
formal approach to that quite often so

845
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,189
if I phone in and then I say hey I'm

846
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,290
your dell account rep I know you have

847
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,060
Dells I know what models you have right

848
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:25,590
I can call in and sound pretty pretty

849
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,389
legit go through hey I want to send you

850
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:29,220
some free demos how's that sound it

851
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,810
sounds pretty good right I just need to

852
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,090
know how is it how's it working out with

853
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,500
your VPN client right so I can start

854
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:39,300
digging get a little bit of content that

855
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,950
way you're so special the engagement

856
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,020
survey I use this one this one worked

857
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,480
really well and it's really fast too

858
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,220
once I get the person you know I do some

859
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,900
name-dropping I do that trick hey I'm

860
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,990
working with the VP of HR they gave me

861
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,640
your name right and they said you could

862
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,100
help me develop this engagement survey

863
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,960
and as soon as you get them to say yes

864
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,250
and I don't even the person said yes and

865
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,050
then I moved into the questions so

866
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,130
quickly I barely heard it just so you

867
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,710
just get that little bit of commitment

868
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,420
and just start rolling right boom boom

869
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:09,420
boom boom and they're answering

870
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:11,130
questions as quickly as they can and so

871
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:14,460
that's that's a really good one for a

872
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:16,890
lot of content the final one there okay

873
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,260
you caught me a lot of people say well

874
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,990
if you get questioned you should never

875
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,220
drop your pretext the joke is even when

876
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,690
you're going into the police car with

877
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,279
the handcuffs on you should always stay

878
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,919
in pretext

879
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:31,169
and I kind of didn't want to do that I

880
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,659
wanted to put a twist on that a little

881
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:35,190
bit so it never happened I was really

882
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,289
wishing it would happen hopefully in the

883
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,149
future it will or they say hey you know

884
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:41,340
what like Rob I'm not really buying this

885
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:43,258
I don't think you're my dell account rep

886
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,218
this actually happened in Vegas to

887
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:45,840
somebody else and it was hilarious

888
00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:47,609
because they knew the person they were

889
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,428
impersonating it's like I don't think

890
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:52,320
that's you and they were arguing for

891
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:54,419
about five minutes no it's me it's me

892
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,279
it's like okay where do you live and it

893
00:31:54,419 --> 00:32:00,419
just went downhill but it was it was

894
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:02,669
hilarious so so my pretext was okay you

895
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,619
know what congratulations you caught me

896
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:07,289
you're the only one in this whole

897
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:08,999
company that caught me right I'm gonna

898
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:10,769
give your name to the executive and

899
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:13,559
because you're an example of the type of

900
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:16,109
employee that they need to have so you

901
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:17,339
know I'm making a note of that and hey

902
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:18,389
if you've got a minute can I just roll

903
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:24,658
through the rest of these questions just

904
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:27,089
to develop a baseline so so you know

905
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:29,070
I've made them feel good right nobody's

906
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:30,899
victimized he well they kind of are but

907
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,309
they feel good about it right so I'm

908
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:34,498
just kind of like flipping it over and

909
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:36,178
keep on rolling so I thought that might

910
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:39,419
be more effective so I was I really want

911
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:42,179
to try that in the future now this is

912
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:45,269
the reflective moment that I promised

913
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:46,619
you okay some questions to ask yourself

914
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:47,909
you don't have to say this out loud

915
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:50,639
because some of these might be

916
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:52,919
uncomfortable you know what you know

917
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:55,859
when your staff especially your exec

918
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,389
have been socially engineered right you

919
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:58,889
know if some executives will come to you

920
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:01,258
and say hey yeah I've been emailing this

921
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:01,978
bad guy back and forth and you know they

922
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:04,649
think that's funny

923
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:06,869
other executives may not say anything

924
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:09,629
because of embarrassment or something

925
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:12,389
like that so do you have a mechanism to

926
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:13,678
trigger that feedback to you right

927
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:14,988
because you probably want to know sooner

928
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,059
than later

929
00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:20,070
how bad would it be if your CFO

930
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:21,389
transferred you know millions of dollars

931
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,129
there's companies out there that have

932
00:33:21,389 --> 00:33:25,408
wire transferred 50 million dollars

933
00:33:23,129 --> 00:33:27,089
right or more I remember the one 50

934
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:29,549
million which is seems like a lot of

935
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:31,200
money right I would be in a lot of

936
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,820
trouble if I transferred 50 million

937
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,779
dollars from my bank account if there

938
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:38,849
was that much in there so you know so

939
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:40,100
that's that could be embarrassing does

940
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:42,230
your insurance cover that

941
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,469
right that would be interesting to take

942
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:49,040
a look at if you give away your money

943
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:50,720
are you insured right do you have the

944
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,629
internal resources to manage that risk

945
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,040
right so if that was to happen what

946
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,110
would you do would you start doing some

947
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,909
sort of forensics on that to figure out

948
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:01,879
what exactly happened would you have

949
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:04,880
visibility would your InfoSec staff have

950
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,680
the skills to do that and then finally

951
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,560
you know can you navigate through

952
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:14,240
Equifax paradox what I mean by that is

953
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,670
who's getting fired right so and if you

954
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:21,409
don't know the answer to that question

955
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:25,240
it's probably you so it's good to know

956
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:27,679
that all right so some recommendations

957
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:29,419
understand your exposure first of all

958
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,830
right so always sent yourself that's

959
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,840
always fun

960
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:34,790
oh isn't your company find those social

961
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,320
butterflies so who are who are the

962
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:38,060
people that are publishing your VPN

963
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,350
information out there now that's

964
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,670
probably a good thing to take a look at

965
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:43,940
what's at risk

966
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:46,460
right is it proprietary information is

967
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:49,270
it source code is it big buckets of

968
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:51,590
money right so what are you protecting

969
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:54,830
these attacks are monetized so the end

970
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:56,600
of the day they want to make money so

971
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:58,730
build up some defenses against phishing

972
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,230
some things you can do you can do a

973
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,940
phishing program everybody's doing this

974
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,530
these days you want to measure the

975
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,240
clicks but I would also say you probably

976
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,560
want to take a look at how people are

977
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,270
reporting it as well

978
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,090
I did a phishing program it was a lot of

979
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:13,070
fun it looked really cool and I was a

980
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,690
novice and I released all the emails at

981
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,700
the same time so everybody got at the

982
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,740
same time don't do that because people

983
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,450
got it and they're like oh cool what's

984
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,919
this right and they're clicking on it

985
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,480
which they're not supposed to do just to

986
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,650
see the splash screen then they're

987
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,710
telling their friend to click on it

988
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,000
right so just don't do that and I didn't

989
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,710
measure reporting which would be a good

990
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,090
metric to have right how many people are

991
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:35,810
actually telling you they got this this

992
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:37,430
weird email you can create an ext tag on

993
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,250
your incoming mail that's coming in from

994
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:43,250
the outside so when the president gets

995
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,630
the one of actually the CFO gets the

996
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,060
email from the president that says hey

997
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:48,470
can you wire transfer 50 million to that

998
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,570
other company over there it's an

999
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:52,529
emergency if they see the ext and they

1000
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,730
realize that oh maybe it's not the

1001
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:56,820
president right because that's coming

1002
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,680
from the outside in you won't do this

1003
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,300
but you know you could stop allowing

1004
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,560
active links in the email so they

1005
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,090
actually have to copy and paste and they

1006
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,720
would actually see that okay it's it's

1007
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:08,490
not going to amazon.com and then provide

1008
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,080
some other channels other than email

1009
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,370
right and we're starting to do this

1010
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,259
quite a bit we're realizing that we're

1011
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,490
overloaded with emails right and the

1012
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,680
amount of time you can spend reading any

1013
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:19,919
particular email is probably seconds

1014
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,589
right so some other channels there's and

1015
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,920
there's so many of them defense against

1016
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:28,230
phishing right so your executives are

1017
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,570
the the highest target the the big value

1018
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,850
target right so if you could vish them

1019
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,100
ask their permission first be very

1020
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:37,920
sensitive use that as a learning

1021
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:40,279
opportunity but tread lightly right they

1022
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,990
may not find this as entertaining as you

1023
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,550
create choke points so I talked about

1024
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:47,129
the receptionist's a little bit and

1025
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:49,740
really they do such a wonderful job of

1026
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,390
protecting our business and do they ever

1027
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,100
get any info SEC training or awareness

1028
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:55,980
training other than they say the the

1029
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:59,370
annual click-through stuff right so that

1030
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:02,160
might be an opportunity on your PBX you

1031
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:04,980
probably have dial by name do you still

1032
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,750
need it I love that feature because I

1033
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,760
can go in there at night and I can get

1034
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:10,260
everybody's number I can get everybody's

1035
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,760
title and then I go through their

1036
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,520
voicemail and listen to their voicemail

1037
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,560
I get so much information do you need it

1038
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,360
probably not maybe your sales department

1039
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,000
needs it maybe your marketing needs it

1040
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:25,110
but your IT department other people that

1041
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,880
probably not right I don't want it dids

1042
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,070
you've directed or dials most of your

1043
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,720
staff does not need di DS

1044
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,430
give them extensions have it routed

1045
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,620
through reception they're probably

1046
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:36,690
calling out a lot or some but they're

1047
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:39,420
not getting a lot of inward calls right

1048
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:41,030
so why have that and don't match your D

1049
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,980
IDs with your extensions either oh

1050
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:45,330
that's that's not very good stop

1051
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,890
answering the phone I got in trouble for

1052
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,810
AB for putting this bullet point on

1053
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,359
there right so take that with a grain of

1054
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,860
salt that's one of my opinions you know

1055
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,120
if you recognize the name and it's your

1056
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,640
boss you probably wanted to pick up the

1057
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,990
phone I did this this talk internally

1058
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,569
and a lot of managers looked really

1059
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:02,220
badly at me so I had to put that in

1060
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,310
brackets they're always answer if it's

1061
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,859
your boss

1062
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:10,759
get on the offensive right so I write a

1063
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:12,770
lot of policies that nobody reads and we

1064
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,990
do the annual training as well the

1065
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,230
awareness training and the joke is how

1066
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:20,000
fast can you get that done right

1067
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:21,110
nobody's reading policy in it you know

1068
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,140
what you have to have it so I'm not

1069
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:26,450
saying don't have it but a majority

1070
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:28,759
people are not reading them right when

1071
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:31,310
you fire somebody you point to it right

1072
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:34,250
but instead I'm saying we need to create

1073
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:36,470
a culture change right of continual

1074
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:38,750
challenges so take those people that are

1075
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:40,970
doing the right thing and make them into

1076
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:43,130
heroes communicate okay we're doing this

1077
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:45,200
this goal so InfoSec is doing this

1078
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:47,210
advertise that right we don't have to be

1079
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,129
the bad guys we can say hey we're doing

1080
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,380
this this is exciting you can be part of

1081
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,930
this give stuff away give out Starbucks

1082
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,460
cards right be the good guy yeah right

1083
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,319
you'll get so much popularity just by

1084
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,390
giving out Starbucks cards put people's

1085
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,100
picture on on your sharepoint or your

1086
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:03,710
confluence site and say hey this person

1087
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:06,020
did this it was fantastic that's really

1088
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:07,460
what we should be doing and then

1089
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,800
ultimately we want to get to culture

1090
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,750
change right so one of the problems we

1091
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,820
often complain about is oh the bad guys

1092
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,440
only have to get lucky once or you know

1093
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,360
I don't have budget to really and make a

1094
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,400
difference and to protect all the things

1095
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,590
I need to protect yeah that's that's

1096
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,200
that may be true right but and we can't

1097
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:26,450
scale if we don't scale we can't we

1098
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,370
can't really win that that war right so

1099
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,870
if all our employees care about security

1100
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:32,000
and we always say they should but they

1101
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:35,029
don't right they're not rewarded on that

1102
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,720
so they won't right we have to reward

1103
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:40,820
them and we're not at this point putting

1104
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,500
that on their yearly review right that's

1105
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,930
not one of their goals necessarily

1106
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,850
hopefully one day it will be but we can

1107
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:49,640
do other things right we can make them

1108
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:51,380
into heroes and and then you can based

1109
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,480
on that you can scale you can make them

1110
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,620
into mentors right so then they're

1111
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,620
teaching on your behalf

1112
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,950
alright some of the tools that I looked

1113
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,960
at and you look at this is like well Rob

1114
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:05,689
I use those tools every day yeah it's

1115
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,210
really how you use them and then what

1116
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:10,519
your target is using right so you kind

1117
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,289
of roll down this list LinkedIn if it's

1118
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:14,359
a corporate target that's where I would

1119
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:17,059
start use x-ray it'll help you out a lot

1120
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:19,369
to bypass the page service twitter is

1121
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:21,440
great for images very fast you can do

1122
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:24,170
that you can do tools like all my all my

1123
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,849
tweets to get everything all at once

1124
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:28,369
Instagram if you want to do geolocation

1125
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:30,890
it's not bad there's better tools out

1126
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:33,289
there where you can fence off an area

1127
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:36,890
set a time and then get multiple

1128
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:38,750
multiple channels of of that so there's

1129
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:40,129
what's one there's another tool out

1130
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,940
there for emergency management I can't

1131
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,289
think of it right now but if you're

1132
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,869
curious just let me know I send it to

1133
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:47,089
you Facebook's not bad SlideShare

1134
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:48,619
surprisingly good right I don't know why

1135
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:51,410
but people put their reference letters

1136
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:53,960
on SlideShare and that gives you tons of

1137
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:56,180
information personal websites are gold

1138
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,190
and job postings I can learn all about

1139
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,779
you know your Cisco firewall that you

1140
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,880
have and you know what you're hiring

1141
00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:03,500
people to look after right just go

1142
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,660
through that Google Maps you can get

1143
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,430
your picture of the building entry

1144
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,470
points stuff like that

1145
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:11,538
signage sometimes you can read that

1146
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:13,189
which is very nice if you're gonna do

1147
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:14,569
physical pen testing that's a good

1148
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,940
starting point and then once you're

1149
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:20,150
through that move into more specialized

1150
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:22,430
right so you know your wearable Strava

1151
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:25,730
is great I can see where you ran showed

1152
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:28,759
an IOT right pastebin I can set up an

1153
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,170
alert on your company Spokeo at an

1154
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:32,779
individual level I'm gonna get a ton

1155
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:35,599
information from that and then more

1156
00:41:32,779 --> 00:41:37,099
specialized which is even more fun right

1157
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,339
so I can look up people's you know

1158
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:42,049
criminal record or their taxes property

1159
00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:43,910
management is a really nice area that

1160
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:46,240
I'm focusing on a lot lately there's a

1161
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:50,029
ton of information out there for that

1162
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:53,299
some resources so one of the best

1163
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:55,609
resources is Michael bezels in Intel

1164
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:57,380
techniques you can go there there's a

1165
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:59,990
ton of tools there it's like this big

1166
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:02,029
menu system of tools so if you want to

1167
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03,618
do some OSINT on somebody or a company

1168
00:42:02,029 --> 00:42:05,119
just go there and it's kind of

1169
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:08,760
simplifies everything for you

1170
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,710
he's got training he's got a podcast

1171
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,100
tons of information if you live up my

1172
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:16,280
way tottington does something similar he

1173
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,600
trains most of the government agencies

1174
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,520
he's a great resource as well again

1175
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,200
online training articles and stuff like

1176
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,570
that and then of course the social

1177
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,720
engineer right he really is the one that

1178
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:30,630
organizes this sec TF both at Def Con

1179
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,419
and Derby now so he's got tons of

1180
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:35,130
information great podcasts as well if

1181
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,760
you've got some money you can buy plural

1182
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:40,470
site if with your company cyber e is a

1183
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,840
free resource online as well and they've

1184
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:47,759
got lots of great tools I'm a big fan of

1185
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:50,220
them alright so I rock through that

1186
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,530
pretty quickly if you've got questions

1187
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:54,689
we can do that now I just want to tell

1188
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:56,880
you this is my latest project here my

1189
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:59,430
it's kind of an OSINT project so if you

1190
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,540
have if you have any interest in ocean

1191
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,009
you can take a look at that let me know

1192
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,930
what you think always looking for

1193
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,790
feedback on that if you want to reach me

1194
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:09,149
those are the ways you can do so now

1195
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:09,990
twitter is your best bet so we've got a

1196
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:15,080
few minutes

1197
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:15,080
questions yeah the very back

1198
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:24,630
yeah so I didn't cover that but that's

1199
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:26,010
one of the places where I started you

1200
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,470
know just doing a who is there's a lot

1201
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:30,900
of good tools out there that provide

1202
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:32,490
information on that I like to look at

1203
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,280
who registered the domain and then I

1204
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:37,049
look at the IPS go on to error and look

1205
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,099
at who owns those IPS that's great as

1206
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,890
well that'll tell you a lot of good

1207
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:42,869
information I got emails I got phone

1208
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:45,089
numbers and the phone numbers nice

1209
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:47,190
because even if you get the pretext that

1210
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,810
helps you with the bank of numbers

1211
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:50,550
because then you know at least I've got

1212
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:52,259
that far right and then it's narrowing

1213
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,290
down the suffix of those phone numbers

1214
00:43:52,260 --> 00:44:07,500
so definitely want to look at that

1215
00:43:54,290 --> 00:44:09,599
yes sir yeah it's yeah yeah yeah yeah I

1216
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,820
don't really need that right like if you

1217
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,849
gave me someone's name or a company's

1218
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:18,810
name all you need then is time there's

1219
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:20,790
so much out there right it's it's you

1220
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:23,130
know it's it's amazing how much is out

1221
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:25,940
there so just need time and you can

1222
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,940
start gathering everything

1223
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:35,940
yeah so I'm sure there's a lot of good

1224
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:39,780
tools out there unfortunately I'm not

1225
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:41,369
using any of them if somebody has

1226
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,869
recommendations on that I'd love to hear

1227
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:44,849
that because that burned a lot of my

1228
00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:47,640
time and I'm still struggling with that

1229
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:49,109
so right now I use Excel right people

1230
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,868
use Excel for everything they probably

1231
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:54,480
shouldn't including myself so I would

1232
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:57,060
have links within Excel to the to these

1233
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,920
different channels and then I could sort

1234
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,630
and stuff like that in Excel so that's

1235
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,060
why I use that and I knew how to use it

1236
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:06,200
so but I wouldn't recommend it

1237
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,200
yes sir

1238
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:16,450
yeah

1239
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:24,420
yeah

1240
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:26,940
yeah yeah I saw people use that and I

1241
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:29,580
think that's very effective you know the

1242
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,620
joke is you know people put their there

1243
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:33,330
they're going on holiday on Facebook and

1244
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,440
then their house gets robbed right same

1245
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,390
idea

1246
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,220
my out of office I'm very careful with

1247
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:40,529
that I simply say that I'm not available

1248
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,240
that could mean anything but as an

1249
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,920
attack or the minute you see that you

1250
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,939
could then you know you could leverage

1251
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,920
that for sure

1252
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,350
so the I don't like to put a lot of

1253
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,210
detail in that if I say I'm in Hawaii

1254
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:52,920
then they'll use that right oh hey yeah

1255
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:54,510
I'm calling cuz Rob's in Hawaii I said

1256
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,820
yeah he said I should give you a call to

1257
00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:01,700
get this so for sure that's a good

1258
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:01,700
technique yes

1259
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:12,690
so it wasn't on Facebook it was on

1260
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:14,368
Twitter and yeah yeah there was there

1261
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:16,410
was myself and there was another person

1262
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:18,990
who talked about that where they found

1263
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:20,730
it on Twitter and I don't know what

1264
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,910
people are thinking I think that that's

1265
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:26,040
you know as we do our self-promotion

1266
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:28,319
with these social media channels and we

1267
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,240
build a brand as a night as an

1268
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:32,339
individual we have to be a bit careful

1269
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,109
about what we're putting out there right

1270
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:35,369
so we're proud of the companies we work

1271
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:37,740
for and we want to talk about the

1272
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:40,650
companies we work for but I don't think

1273
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:45,180
it's appropriate to - it's post or VPN

1274
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:46,770
configuration so yeah it's that's a

1275
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,390
really interesting area right is where

1276
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:50,819
do you draw the line with the

1277
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:53,819
self-promotion and branding right so

1278
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:56,609
it's VPN was definitely across the line

1279
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:58,170
so yeah I recommend go out and take a

1280
00:46:56,609 --> 00:46:59,369
look at that right see if any of your

1281
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,839
employees have done that that's one

1282
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:01,740
example of things they probably don't

1283
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:06,380
want to do and then you can build

1284
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,379
awareness around that yes sir

1285
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:15,830
yeah so all of the information is

1286
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:17,750
open-source and so you put references to

1287
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:19,400
all the information that you collected

1288
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:23,090
so you have links to it so one of the

1289
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,070
bits of one of the bits of evidence that

1290
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,900
I found was a YouTube video a tour of

1291
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:29,990
their office which was incredibly useful

1292
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:33,050
yeah so I did that frame by frame and

1293
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:34,580
you could see the in the mirror there

1294
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,140
was a reflection of somebody bringing up

1295
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,210
their badge like that and so I

1296
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,520
screenshot of that I had the second in

1297
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:43,670
the video and sent the link in for that

1298
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:47,750
so yeah there's yeah that's how you do

1299
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:51,740
that yes sir yeah I think it was about

1300
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:53,480
50 pages and yeah you know you could

1301
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,740
have gone more and more and more and

1302
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,780
it's funny because you start going down

1303
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:59,560
that rabbit hole and it's so fun right

1304
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:02,360
like oh yeah I got this one right and

1305
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,370
yeah it's just you feel like a private

1306
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:10,250
investigator or something right so it's

1307
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:11,660
a real rush so almost I was so

1308
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,180
frustrated because I there was one or

1309
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:16,490
two that I didn't get and it was who

1310
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:20,299
does their garbage and who does their

1311
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:22,189
bug extermination and I was trying I was

1312
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:24,890
working so hard at that and you know

1313
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,630
trying to get different camera angles of

1314
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:28,609
their office and I could see there was a

1315
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:30,140
truck in their parking lot oh maybe

1316
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:31,880
that's it but I couldn't get it quite

1317
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,940
right using all sorts of different

1318
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:38,080
satellite imagery and yeah that was fun

1319
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:40,140
but missed those two

1320
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,140
you

1321
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:48,270
