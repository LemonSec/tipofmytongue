1
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,710
so it's called big game theory hunting

2
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,360
the peculiarities of human behavior in

3
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,260
the InfoSec game which I understand is a

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,869
little vague

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,610
if you don't know Marian she's like an

6
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,140
amazing reverse engineering malware

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:31,050
analyst she's not working at Intel

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,910
actually and she had a great talk

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,370
called I think it was big-game hunting

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,260
about like I think was like again

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,180
reverse engineering malware and so I

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,320
wanted to riff off of that because

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,960
there's a great presentation

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,269
so I'm Kelly I'm a product manager in

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,579
the InfoSec world so I do the like

16
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:49,500
strategizing and vision stuff related to

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,730
building the security products I'm

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,410
really trying to think about like what's

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,480
the actual value that people need as a

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,328
security practitioner rather than just

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,190
like bolting on features I spend most of

22
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,980
my weekends and evenings looking at

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,449
things like behavioral econ lately

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,128
looking at like cross-domain analysis

25
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,350
from like climate change looking at

26
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,210
different models resiliency to see how

27
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,830
it applies to infra sec I think in

28
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,080
general cross-domain research is super

29
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,450
important people don't do it enough like

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,710
not just an info ii 'try domain but it

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,840
turns out there are lots of smart people

32
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,720
in lots of different areas so it's good

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,630
to learn from them and this is game

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,399
theory um so the talk is about Game

35
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,979
three but it's really going to be about

36
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:31,470
behavioral game theory but a traditional

37
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,550
game theory like Game three or 101 you

38
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,530
see a lot of times particularly on

39
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,479
Twitter people conducting these sorts of

40
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,220
analyses it gets really old really fast

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,950
and I don't think it's a good framework

42
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,660
for us so it's time for hunting some

43
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,310
game theory if you aren't familiar there

44
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,500
was a meme I think during the election

45
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,910
where someone said something that was

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,319
not related to game theory and said it

47
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,300
was time for game theory and it's been

48
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,660
kind of a meme ever since so it's

49
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,489
actually time to debunk game theory so

50
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,709
question for the audience do you believe

51
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:02,729
bug free software is a reasonable

52
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:05,009
assumption yeah yeah thumbs-down correct

53
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:08,758
and do you believe wetware like our

54
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:11,670
brains is more complex than software yes

55
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,859
okay so traditional game theory relies

56
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,069
on the assumption of bug free wetware so

57
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,989
this is a terrible assumption behavioral

58
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,910
game 3 assumes there's no such thing as

59
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,860
bug free so like most of you in the room

60
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,469
if you're kind of offensively minded you

61
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,270
probably agree with this assumption mary

62
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:29,040
gomen who was a Nobel Prize

63
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,080
winning physicists also said think how

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,700
hard physics would be if particles could

65
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,850
think that's why I think it's a really

66
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,980
interesting problem area then Dan query

67
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,420
Dan Gere he was quoting someone but he

68
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,399
said amateurs study cryptography

69
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,309
Professional Studies economics so that's

70
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,190
a nice pat on the back for me and this

71
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,290
is what you're going to learn today why

72
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,170
traditional game theory isn't even a

73
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,660
theory and is also unfit for strategy

74
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,339
making a new framework that I'm

75
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,710
proposing for modeling the InfoSec game

76
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,390
based on behavioral based insights and

77
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,340
finally new defensive strategies that

78
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,690
exploit either your adversaries thinking

79
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,450
or learning and I'll explain what both

80
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:12,920
of those are so let's go hunting to find

81
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:16,190
out why so first what is game theory

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,839
actually discovered this after troopers

83
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,010
when I went in I kind of assumed

84
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,300
everyone knew what game theory was

85
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,320
because that's definitely the impression

86
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,390
you get when you kind of go to

87
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,070
conferences looking at InfoSec Twitter

88
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,529
turns out nobody really knows what it is

89
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,609
but we like pretending like we do so

90
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,290
this is a refresher you don't have to

91
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,140
admit whether you do or don't but I

92
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,179
think it's helpful so game theory is a

93
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,399
mathematical language used to describe

94
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,980
canary scenarios a conflict and

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,200
cooperation so it really is more about

96
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,209
language in theory it doesn't actually

97
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,459
based on fact it's all theoretical and

98
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,380
thinking about these imaginary games so

99
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,940
I use it as an engendering tool like

100
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,950
really something off of which so like

101
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,840
think about other things so you can

102
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,160
dictate optimal strategies so again

103
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,750
that's why it's a language you can frame

104
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,700
what a certain game or a certain

105
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,940
conflict looks like but it isn't the

106
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,769
theory of the conflict itself so game

107
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,150
theory applies whenever actions of

108
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,250
players are interdependent so basically

109
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,350
I make a move like your move is going to

110
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,200
adjust or be different depending on the

111
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,609
move I make so different the different

112
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,260
strategic scenarios include a bunch of

113
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,640
different types of games which I'm about

114
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,320
to enumerate as well as to print

115
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,680
solutions for each depending on the

116
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,510
approach you have so first zero-sum

117
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,400
games so for example in chess there's

118
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,710
one winner if well one loser it's pretty

119
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,239
straightforward in poker the amount won

120
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,260
by someone is equal to everyone else's

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,700
losses non-sterile some games so some

122
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,680
people think the stock market is as your

123
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,719
ISM some came but it's not like everyone

124
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,380
can benefit everyone's like 401ks can

125
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,030
increase

126
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,340
though there's a separate discussion

127
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,590
about how passive investing in index

128
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,289
funds are may be problematic for that

129
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,849
area basically as the economy expands

130
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,660
like everyone can benefit so that's why

131
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,700
it's nonzero-sum

132
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,830
the prisoner's dilemma is also

133
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,120
nonzero-sum I'm gonna dig into the

134
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,700
person er still and I'm just very

135
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,890
briefly in a bit but it's not like one

136
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,670
person wins one person loses and the

137
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,719
like loss and gain completely cancel out

138
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,390
there are negative some games so like

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,430
nuclear war both people do not benefit

140
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,560
at all everybody it's much worse off

141
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,090
climate change is also kind of like a

142
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,700
really terrible game of chicken and

143
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,500
everyone is worse off but they're

144
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,090
positive some games like free trade is

145
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,640
often thought of a positive Sun game

146
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,560
because everybody benefits it's not well

147
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,120
Green Administration aside like most

148
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,670
people assume that like it's not a

149
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,500
complete like one negative one when

150
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,270
you're conducting free trade then also

151
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,590
equal rights that's when when everyone's

152
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,799
better off there's lots of empirical

153
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,390
evidence for this too so there are also

154
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,550
in these games again thinking about game

155
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,260
theory is a language one of the their

156
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,490
different types of information so

157
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,170
complete for it's incomplete

158
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,090
basically you know the types of

159
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,310
opponents you have and their motivations

160
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,570
incomplete information incomplete is

161
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,100
when you don't actually know who your

162
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,870
adversary is and what their motivations

163
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,890
are so this case you know the type of

164
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,570
big kitties that you are facing perfect

165
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,400
first imperfect information so perfect

166
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,800
information is you know the moves that

167
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,950
the other person's making in imperfect

168
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,890
you don't then finally information

169
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:13,590
cemetry versus asymmetry so in symmetry

170
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,870
each like opponent has the same amount

171
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,700
of info about the other opponent and in

172
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,910
asymmetry like they each have different

173
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,500
levels of information about each other

174
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:25,250
there are also defender attacker

175
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,200
defender games also called dad games and

176
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,670
these are sequential games in which

177
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,680
setzer players are attackers and

178
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,210
defenders as you might expect the

179
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,790
Foundation's are in traditional game

180
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,799
theory attackers in the common theory

181
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,480
you want to be maximally harmful a lot

182
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,280
of times it's a terrorism use case

183
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,950
they're looking at like what's the most

184
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,059
amount of destruction that I can cause

185
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,250
they have some sort of specific goal in

186
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,470
mind obviously that's not really true in

187
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,570
this domain and many other domains so it

188
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,820
tends to be very narrow and then it also

189
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,469
assumes people are risk neutral and it's

190
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,450
like I said want to be actually harmful

191
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,300
so both of those assumptions don't

192
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,490
really hold in the real world but the

193
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,500
first move is defenders choose some sort

194
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,170
of defensive investment plans so they

195
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,370
construct like a big wall like whatever

196
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,040
you want to think about it but they make

197
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,570
the first move so then the second move

198
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,220
is attackers observe the defensive

199
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,140
preparations let's say like hardening

200
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,900
infrastructure and they choose their

201
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,969
attack plan so like I said the goal they

202
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,469
often think about is like for example

203
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,800
there's a lot of stuff with them what is

204
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:28,490
the Konan burg bridges and it's looking

205
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,230
at how can you bomb like this one bridge

206
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,940
but nash equilibrium is also used to

207
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,530
solve these games and this is bad

208
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,300
because the nash equilibrium is actually

209
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,669
pretty simplistic and not very accurate

210
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,550
for the real world the nash equilibrium

211
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,170
is looking at the optimal outcome of a

212
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,060
non cooperative game so basically when

213
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:49,140
you have two players trying to beat each

214
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,730
other it's it's good as a concept to

215
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,490
analyze whatever the outcome is but it's

216
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,930
not very good for anything in practice

217
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,610
so players are making the ideas players

218
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,620
make the best decisions for themselves

219
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,720
while taking their opponents decisions

220
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,580
still into account so thinking about how

221
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,100
the other player is going to play but

222
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,550
it's it's not really thinking long-term

223
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:11,880
either I should clarify so the

224
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:15,060
prisoner's dilemma the basic idea is

225
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,130
that in an ideal world everyone would

226
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,170
stay silent so it's basically you and

227
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,370
your partner get arrested now the police

228
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,630
are questioning you you're not allowed

229
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,060
to talk to your partner what do you do

230
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,680
so if they both stay silent they'll

231
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,760
serve a really small amount of time that

232
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,220
negative one negative one

233
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,440
they both confess it's say like two

234
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,120
years and two years but then if one

235
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,059
person confesses the other refuses

236
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,549
whoever stayed silent actually gets four

237
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:40,469
years in prison which is worse so even

238
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,659
though the optimal outcome is that both

239
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,030
players refuse in practice they're

240
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,500
probably going to confess because the if

241
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,540
you look kind of across the row it's

242
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,410
still more advantageous kind of as a

243
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,880
whole for them to confess than not it's

244
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,829
the problem with the Nash equilibrium is

245
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,230
it's based on a priori reasoning so it

246
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,600
relies on theoretical deduction verse

247
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,240
observation or experience it also

248
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,370
assumes rational all-knowing players a

249
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,970
lot of times people don't even know the

250
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,589
game that they're playing I think that

251
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,529
true in the InfoSec game though I try to

252
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:13,120
codify what that means then they assume

253
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:15,730
others decisions don't affect you but

254
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,769
that's super unrealistic because in my

255
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,449
opinion a lot of times if someone makes

256
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:23,050
a certain move it can cut off entire

257
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:24,699
like decision paths for you as well but

258
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,089
a lot of people have applied the Nash

259
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:29,500
equilibrium to InfoSec over the years

260
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:31,959
particularly at the more I will say

261
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,389
business minded conferences you'll see a

262
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,279
lot of talks about how Nash equilibrium

263
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:39,790
justifies this product or this vendors

264
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:41,050
existence just not very rigorous so some

265
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,389
of the conclusions that I was able to

266
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,769
find just from a Google search defenders

267
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:46,540
should play extremely fast so the

268
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:48,370
attacker drops out of the game like for

269
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,870
any defenders in the room like the idea

270
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,209
that you constantly are playing faster

271
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,709
just totally unrealistic another

272
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,359
conclusion which was probably my

273
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,518
favorite is that it's better to invest

274
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
in some sort of security but not to

275
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,240
invest regardless of the attacker

276
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:12,628
strategy so who knew security is

277
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:14,860
important yes yeah so the idea would be

278
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:17,199
I'm trying to they didn't they were very

279
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,000
example light but I think the idea was

280
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,319
like for example if you think that an

281
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,970
attackers in your database it would be

282
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,740
like just shut down all of your network

283
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,149
and then figure out what's going on it's

284
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,389
like immediately even if you aren't sure

285
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:29,860
so and then the other thing is like

286
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:32,139
applying tons of mathematical equations

287
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:38,430
to the problem which no defenders ever

288
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:40,720
gonna do so so a new defensive framework

289
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,189
the idea here is that now that we know

290
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,230
game theory is a language used to

291
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:47,290
describe some sort of game or conflict

292
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,209
it's not just a theory we need to

293
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,009
explore like what sort of framework does

294
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:52,449
work what sort of theory does work and

295
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:55,269
I'm going to be leveraging behavioural

296
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:57,250
insights so using game theory for its

297
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:59,199
expressive power I think is really

298
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,269
important so it's also important to look

299
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,040
at data outside of game theory so again

300
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:05,139
looking at kind of cross-domain analysis

301
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,129
like what insights can be cleaned from

302
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:09,250
other domains when they've been

303
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:10,569
researching this sort of stuff but first

304
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,949
I think it's important to figure out

305
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:16,990
what game is InfoSec I argue it is a dad

306
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:19,179
game so it's continuous defense and

307
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,830
attack it's nonzero some I think

308
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,270
sometimes people think of

309
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,890
info ii zero-sum but i really don't

310
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,250
think so particularly in the case of

311
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,120
like nation-state espionage

312
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,620
realistically it's probably not going to

313
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,240
affect your day-to-day operations very

314
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,310
much it probably won't affect your stock

315
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,840
price i mean maybe if you're reachable

316
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,880
like Equifax is the first time it really

317
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,620
affected the stock price of a company so

318
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,990
it means to be seen if that's kind of

319
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,310
it's an unique case like in target's

320
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,860
case it affected their earnings I think

321
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,260
one quarter but not very much beyond

322
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,750
that then I think there's incomplete

323
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,790
imperfect and asymmetrical information I

324
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,920
don't think we know nearly enough about

325
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,420
our opponents we can't track their moves

326
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,339
we don't even know most the time like

327
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,900
what type of attacker is and we

328
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,200
certainly have asymmetrical information

329
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,699
it's also sequential and dynamic so it's

330
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,930
not just like one round and then you're

331
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:10,390
done it's a kind of ongoing process I

332
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:12,699
also think it's a uniquely potentially

333
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,199
tricky game the closest is like a piece

334
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,660
war game in the sense of nuclear

335
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,220
conflict though that's don't compare it

336
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,380
to nuclear conflicts it's completely

337
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,390
different but it's similar as far as the

338
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,450
opacity of information and that is

339
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:27,130
sequential so another question have you

340
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:31,390
heard InfoSec described as a

341
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:34,060
cat-and-mouse game yes fun fact until

342
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,650
last week I had never really thought

343
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,810
about what this meant and I always

344
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,670
assumed that the defender was the mouse

345
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,069
but it's obviously the cat he was never

346
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,520
actually able to catch the mouse so that

347
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,540
was me a couple but I know now

348
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,010
but the problem is traditional game

349
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,560
theory doesn't actually allow for those

350
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,660
or most characteristics of the InfoSec

351
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,520
game because it seems people are

352
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,949
rational and they aren't and it seems

353
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,630
static versus dynamic environments so

354
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,860
again you have kind of like you think

355
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,720
about the cat and mouse they're always

356
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,180
chasing each other traditional game

357
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,680
theory doesn't assume that and also the

358
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,739
fact that you can't ever be one step

359
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,030
ahead of your adversary I think a lot of

360
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,560
people recognize that a lot of times

361
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,860
attackers are one step ahead of

362
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,569
defenders but traditional game theory

363
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,490
doesn't allow for that then also just

364
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,190
empirically speaking deviations from the

365
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,900
Nash equilibrium are everywhere but the

366
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,480
problem was traditional dad games

367
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,090
extrapolate from Nash equilibrium making

368
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,460
it hard to model this so the first time

369
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,470
that behavioral insights from a dad

370
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,270
gamer like a behavioral econ Studies

371
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,400
sudden gank dad games came out was in

372
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,600
March and there hasn't really been much

373
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,910
sense in so I think it's gonna be

374
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,390
something hopefully we see more of over

375
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:45,520
the next few years even John Nash said

376
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:47,620
this I feel personally that the study of

377
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,689
experimental games is the proper route

378
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,700
of travel for finding the ultimate truth

379
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,980
in relation to games displayed by human

380
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,420
players so I think if he even understood

381
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:04,000
it I think it's important to think about

382
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:05,650
so the behavior based framework so I

383
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,070
think it needs to be experimental how do

384
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:10,180
people actually behave and then it's

385
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,950
also good to think about the fact that

386
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,290
people just the way our brains work we

387
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,090
predict our opponents moves by either

388
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,719
thinking or learning which I'm about to

389
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:21,790
explain so thinking is just modeling how

390
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,020
opponents are likely to respond so this

391
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,689
is before you've made a move it's

392
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,850
thinking about what they're going to do

393
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,860
our brains work like volatile memory so

394
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,540
it's kind of like DRAM which needs

395
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,150
constant refresh cycles and it's not

396
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,980
very efficient so working memory is a

397
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:38,439
hard constraint for human brains it's

398
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,960
very hard for us to have a large number

399
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,120
of like higher-order beliefs maintained

400
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,740
so thinking about say 10 steps in the

401
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,060
future just as far as we're thinking

402
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,130
about it and not writing down it's very

403
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,719
difficult for us to do so a lot of times

404
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:53,380
we only think about what's the immediate

405
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,470
kind of step ahead and then humans kind

406
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,910
of suck at recursion so it's increasing

407
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,650
the number of steps really strains our

408
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,230
working memory so it makes it really

409
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,510
difficult to process them learning

410
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,460
however is predicting how opponents will

411
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,980
behave based on their behavior in Prior

412
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:12,430
games around so this takes over once you

413
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,750
have prior experience to leverage you

414
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,219
instant to learn through error

415
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,170
reinforcement learning which just means

416
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,480
trial and error learning and then people

417
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,890
have learning rates so basically how

418
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,380
much experience is factored into

419
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,720
decision-making there's also a very very

420
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,460
small random variable they're just much

421
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,860
smaller than people think a lot of it is

422
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,050
kind of like the past experience that we

423
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,120
have but there's enough that clearly for

424
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,530
our lizard brains they wanted us to keep

425
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,840
trying something a little bit new so

426
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,490
it's a very small factor there then

427
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,870
something I find cool which is not gonna

428
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,000
be exploring at all in this talk I hate

429
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:45,010
to disappoint you is that dopamine

430
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,330
neurons and code errors so I think

431
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,560
there's a lot of interesting stuff to

432
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,590
think about as far as the

433
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,239
economics of attackers and defenders but

434
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,580
I don't have the money for like an MRI

435
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,080
machine so someone does have the money

436
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,000
please give it to me and I'll start to

437
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:03,550
do cool studies but until then no dice

438
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,500
so as a case study there's a study by of

439
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,689
X alone Bou Claire which basically not

440
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,160
an InfoSec but looked at - and

441
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,540
consecutive security games and the

442
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,589
traditional kind of physical security

443
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,880
context across four different strategies

444
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,410
the idea was that you have different

445
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,460
learning rates for attackers again how

446
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,430
much they learn from prior experience

447
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,320
and they tested the number of prevented

448
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,329
attacks for each strategy so basically

449
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,180
there was a four by four payoff matrix

450
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,640
matrix across those four strategies they

451
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,880
were just going to examine the number of

452
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,439
prevented attacks based on that matrix

453
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,210
so what they found was a thick strategy

454
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,800
prevented attacks ten to twenty five

455
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,410
percent of the time which is like really

456
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,939
really terrible a game theory strategy

457
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,130
prevented them about half the time a

458
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,930
random strategy also prevented them

459
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,610
about half the time then the cognitive

460
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,199
modeling strategy which again is

461
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,390
thinking about like what was the prior

462
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,490
behavior of your opponent prevented

463
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,250
sixty-one to seventy seven percent which

464
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:00,160
in numeric terms 22-250 four more

465
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,900
attacks out of the 200 so that takes

466
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,270
into account the fact that again

467
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,800
attackers will favor certain options or

468
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,449
avoid certain options depending on

469
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,938
whether their actions failed or

470
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,319
succeeded in the past there's a paper I

471
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:13,839
have in my references called know your

472
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:16,599
enemy you can see that as a reference so

473
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,458
what it means as attackers aren't

474
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,708
completely unpredictable they're also

475
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:24,449
not like I guess normative decision

476
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:24,449
makers oh sorry

477
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,440
it's not been nearly say like I said

478
00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:00,179
there's been no study of behavioral

479
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,070
economics period physec as far as an

480
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,440
academic study so no nothing has gone

481
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,418
into that well I also appreciate the

482
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,240
questions I do it there's a lot of

483
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,710
material so I encourage I will try to

484
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,210
pause for questions but I'm also very

485
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,869
aware of the fact that this is a very

486
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:17,309
like 50 to 55 minute talk yep but in

487
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:19,289
general there's not enough data like an

488
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:21,960
info SEC at all I think for behavioral

489
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:23,399
related stuff the point to that to me is

490
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,169
like don't be replaced by a random

491
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:26,758
security strategy algorithm if game

492
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:28,470
theory is just as good as a random like

493
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:30,960
you might as well kind of like do

494
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,789
whatever and see if it works so the

495
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,919
implementation so a lot of this is nice

496
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:40,200
in theory but how do you actually do

497
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:42,809
this on a practical level so I'm gonna

498
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,399
walk you through five parts the first is

499
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:46,408
a SWOT analysis which you see you've

500
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:47,998
seen Silicon Valley I sometimes like to

501
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:49,499
think of myself as like the Jared of

502
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:51,570
InfoSec like kind of doing the boring

503
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:53,850
things but I get really excited about it

504
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,619
so we're we're gonna do a SWOT analysis

505
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,600
as well as a perceptional SWOT analysis

506
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:59,189
which is super fancy then going through

507
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,740
thinking exploitation and learning

508
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,690
exploitation then the concept of minimax

509
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,570
and then finally looking ahead for what

510
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:09,779
would be awesome to do in the future so

511
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:11,279
a SWOT analysis the 101 of a traditional

512
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:14,070
SWOT so it's developed by a Harvard

513
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,749
Business School in the 1960s it's a like

514
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,820
super common in business strategy in

515
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:19,769
general so it looks at the objective and

516
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,879
organization or projects to see like

517
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:23,730
what are the strengths weaknesses

518
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:26,009
opportunities and threats strengths and

519
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,509
weaknesses are all internally based so

520
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:28,639
like what are the internal factors that

521
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:31,559
make up your strengths and weaknesses

522
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:33,479
opportunities and threats are taking in

523
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,158
mind like the external context to see

524
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,929
like again what are the opportunities

525
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:40,440
you can pursue what are the external

526
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:42,960
threats to whatever you're working on

527
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,610
so I think you need to model a SWOT for

528
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,970
yourself in relation to your adversary

529
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,949
but also do the reverse the adversary in

530
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,570
relation to you again trying to really

531
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,840
think about like how your opponent is

532
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,460
thinking so a fantastic game theory

533
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,020
professor at NYU named Adam

534
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,360
Brandenburger with whom I had the

535
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,760
pleasure of speaking one of his quotes

536
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,459
is the primary insight of game theory is

537
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,870
the importance of focusing on others of

538
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,610
putting yourself into the shoes of other

539
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,739
players and trying to play out all the

540
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,840
reactions as far as head as possible and

541
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,460
in the vein of Toby's talk like you can

542
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,179
play devil's advocate that's exactly

543
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,890
what you need to be doing in this case

544
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,600
so this is just a very kind of

545
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,490
high-level example swat4 kind of like a

546
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,590
traditional defender some of the

547
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,080
strengths basically you have an

548
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,669
understanding of the target environment

549
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,770
hopefully because it's your environment

550
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:34,140
you have a motivation not to be breached

551
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,639
I think that's definitely a given the

552
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,430
weaknesses are you may have an adequate

553
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,990
budget that's kind of changing given the

554
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,370
level board focus but I think budget

555
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,440
problems are something most people have

556
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,850
experienced a lack of personnel I think

557
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,160
everyone's familiar with there aren't

558
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,629
enough people to hire InfoSec then

559
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,790
finally limited employee training

560
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:52,260
thinking about you know employees click

561
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,690
on phishing links whatever else they are

562
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,790
learning properly that sort of thing is

563
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,470
kind of an internal weakness the

564
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,170
opportunities are leveraging things like

565
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,200
containers to allow for easy tear up and

566
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,520
tear down I just gave a talk about

567
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,080
resilience which talks a little bit more

568
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,520
about that so I encourage you to check

569
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,629
that out if you want to learn more about

570
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,280
that sort of stuff

571
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,630
and then as I mentioned there's

572
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,970
increased support attention to get more

573
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,920
budget the threats though or attackers

574
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,240
can also use new tech for scalability

575
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,550
like I know a lot of what we've been

576
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,470
seeing is they're using like Google

577
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:25,080
services Amazon obviously stuff like

578
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,970
that even Dropbox as far as like new

579
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,980
ways to deliver attacks which is bad

580
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,380
it's also really hard to keep up with

581
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,910
the pace of new attack surface it's hard

582
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,100
enough to kind of have asset management

583
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,660
and then as you get more devices more

584
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,709
software whatever else makes it really

585
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:44,690
difficult so perceptual SWAT this was

586
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,690
developed by the same NYU professor

587
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:51,620
so the idea for perceptual SWOT is that

588
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:54,530
things like core competencies can

589
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:56,570
actually be weaknesses weaknesses can be

590
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:59,330
strengths so if you're familiar with

591
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:01,159
judo it's someone sometimes called the

592
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,020
judo strategy so basically like how do

593
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:07,490
you use your opponent's weight against

594
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:08,629
them so thinking about yourself first

595
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,299
the other what are the perceptional

596
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:13,039
swats so you need to think about what do

597
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:14,510
you think is a strength what's your

598
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,419
perception of a strength how is that

599
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,679
actually weakness and then that's gonna

600
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,720
be the reality and then like what

601
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,610
weakness is actually a strength for your

602
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,929
opponent obviously what the opponent

603
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,459
thinks or what you think as their

604
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:27,679
strength could actually be a weakness

605
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,000
and that presents an opportunity than

606
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,530
what you think is a weakness or they

607
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,740
think as a weakness it's actually a

608
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,750
strength of theirs the idea here is um

609
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,240
so Andrew Grove actually the former CEO

610
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,830
of Intel said that for example the

611
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,530
biggest core rigidity is actually top

612
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,389
management management went through prior

613
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,129
conditions to get to that point and they

614
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,110
don't exactly understand kind of the new

615
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,419
realities and the new challenges that

616
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,830
are being faced so basically the moment

617
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:53,360
that the environment changes the people

618
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,100
at the top are the wrong people to be

619
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,070
there so what you think is a strength is

620
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,389
actually a weakness so I think things

621
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,668
like compliance and fix security

622
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,380
guidelines can sometimes be seen as a

623
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:06,850
strength to at least get a bare minimum

624
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:09,289
but it's also a rigidity right and then

625
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,480
moving on to attackers I think a good

626
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:13,669
example is an attack core strength is

627
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,039
having the time to craft an attack

628
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:17,990
so like mikus talked earlier like a lot

629
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:19,460
of it is about patience problem is you

630
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,289
can also leverage that strength with

631
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,770
strategies that lead attackers down

632
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:26,299
rabbit holes and waste their time

633
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,220
another one is having access to known

634
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:29,960
vulnerabilities the idea is you can

635
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,400
confuse them with fake architecture or

636
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,990
fake looking systems so they can't be

637
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:40,820
certain what you're actually running

638
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:43,610
so thinking exploitation so by talk it's

639
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,740
your nights is mostly going to be about

640
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,330
these sorts of tips and tricks like how

641
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,010
defenders can also exploit things

642
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,840
particularly their attackers way of

643
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,110
thinking through problems so this is a

644
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,790
part of that so belief prompting the

645
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,229
idea is that you just increase the

646
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,540
players thinking by one step

647
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,250
it's part of the idea of as I said

648
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:05,010
before like you can only have so many

649
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:08,310
steps in your head so this is how can

650
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,780
you improve that so what you do is you

651
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:11,460
prompt the player to consider like how

652
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,410
their opponents who their opponents are

653
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,200
and how their opponents will react over

654
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,880
time and I think for security you have

655
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,950
to model assumptions around the capital

656
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,350
time tools risk aversion and as Toby

657
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,030
said like you need to think about like

658
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:26,100
is there a specific sort of adversary

659
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,480
you're looking to emulate and think

660
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,179
about you can't just think about kind of

661
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,890
a generic attacker without having kind

662
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:34,170
of like something specific to test in

663
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,850
mind I take this idea further which is

664
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,230
that you should bottle out just entire

665
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,080
decision trees which I'm going to talk

666
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:42,180
about shortly and general there's been a

667
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,669
lot of research to show for example I

668
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,440
think it was that if if someone's trying

669
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:48,900
to predict their opponent they'll get it

670
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,330
say right 30% of the time traditionally

671
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,160
speaking 70% of the time it's wrong but

672
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:55,169
if you have them perform some sort of

673
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,760
belief prompting that actually switches

674
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:59,100
and they get it right 70 percent of the

675
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,670
time so there's good empirical evidence

676
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:05,790
for this so your goal is to ask if I do

677
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:07,710
something an X how will that change my

678
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:11,460
opponent strategy how are they going to

679
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:14,670
react so a generic belief prompting

680
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,860
guide how would attackers preemptively

681
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:18,300
bypass whatever a defensive move I make

682
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,399
so if I implement two-factor

683
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,680
authentication what will they do instead

684
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,900
what will the opponent do next in

685
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,780
response what are the costs of the

686
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,630
opponent's offensive move like something

687
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,950
super fancy probably they're not going

688
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,680
to do they're gonna try something

689
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:36,420
simpler like fishing at first then also

690
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,430
what's the probability the opponent will

691
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,230
conduct the move but just also can be

692
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:43,080
based on things like cost or time I

693
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:44,580
think additional things like how do you

694
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,710
think our adversary chooses their

695
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,389
delivery method obviously what assets

696
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,040
are they going to go after what

697
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:53,820
countermeasures will they think that we

698
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,800
have and then as an example let's say a

699
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,710
script kiddies lands on one of our

700
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,850
servers what are they going to do next

701
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,380
let's say they perform local

702
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,389
reconnaissance they escalate to whatever

703
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,560
privileges they can get the counter

704
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,660
would be something like privilege

705
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,520
privilege separation and don't hard-code

706
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,770
credentials which we've seen recently

707
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,120
people still definitely do

708
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,040
this leads to the attacker has to

709
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,689
exploit the server and there's a risk

710
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,460
that the server crashes so you're slowly

711
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,140
raising the cost of the attacker that

712
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,710
way and thinking through everything that

713
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:24,030
they're going to do so with decision

714
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:28,350
tree modeling which is attempting to

715
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:30,510
codify that whole process so they're

716
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:32,879
just representations of sequential games

717
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:34,770
in essence which i think is better than

718
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,140
the payoff matrices that show kind of a

719
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:39,570
static point in time so what you want to

720
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,100
do is model these decision trees that

721
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:43,470
include both offense and defense and

722
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,080
I'll show you a visualization of them so

723
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,400
it's not too conceptual you also want to

724
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,110
theorize the probabilities of each

725
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,910
branch which I think first you want to

726
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,770
use kind of like fuzzy estimates which i

727
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:54,660
think is totally fine you can refine

728
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:58,080
those over time based on whatever data

729
00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:00,120
you see or other hunches you have and I

730
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,949
think one of the big benefits which all

731
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,600
really emphasize in a bit is that it

732
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,700
creates tangible metrics to deter your

733
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,459
self justification so again back to

734
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,810
Toby's sock you don't want to have that

735
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,120
kind of like circular thinking that

736
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,649
hivemind thinking so if you put here

737
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,479
where our assumptions you can then go

738
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,920
back and be like look we were wrong here

739
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,160
and you can start to think through what

740
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,080
do we need to do instead a quote that

741
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,120
I've used in a lot of my presentations

742
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,679
it's by Dino daizo V who's great I

743
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,330
definitely recommend you read the

744
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,220
attacker math presentation he put

745
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,080
together but he said attackers will take

746
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,970
the least cost path through an attack

747
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,010
graph from their start node to their

748
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,170
gold node so the attackers have a

749
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:41,520
minimization function and that's one

750
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:43,050
cost so for the decision tree which I

751
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,930
don't have my little laser pointer a

752
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:48,149
full admission I use that mostly as a

753
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,610
toy for my cat and so it's currently in

754
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:53,940
the like cat toy area of my apartment so

755
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:56,129
I completely forgot it which is bad but

756
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,960
anyway so uh you have this kind of like

757
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:01,110
you start it a reality this is the

758
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,940
reality of your world you have say a 25%

759
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,770
probability that skitty's or someone

760
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,270
random let's say hacktivists that's not

761
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:09,330
in vogue anymore apparently

762
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:10,710
it's 25% of the time the nation-state I

763
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,439
think this is probably high for most

764
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,630
organizations is 10% of the time and

765
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,300
then 65% of the time it's gonna be some

766
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:21,160
sort of credit criminal group the idea

767
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:24,219
here how far does this

768
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,219
[Music]

769
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:29,960
okay this doesn't extend very far so I

770
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:31,879
apologize but um as you can see here the

771
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,800
first step remember in a dad game is you

772
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,440
have some sort of defensive investment

773
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,760
plan so let's say you invested in yellow

774
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,740
which is doing nothing

775
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,360
I definitely don't remain recommend

776
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,730
yellow security but lots of people do it

777
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,429
so let's say you yo load you don't have

778
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,170
any privilege separation obviously it

779
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:50,390
the attackers next move is like okay

780
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,700
well we have route this is great these

781
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:55,190
people are idiots so let's say the next

782
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,810
move you make is also yellow and you

783
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,850
don't have any role separation they're

784
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:02,149
like okay there's a database on the box

785
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:03,709
let me use it and then you continue to

786
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,780
Yolo and you don't have any Tokido

787
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,700
cessation or segmentation of let's say

788
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,220
these are like creds they want to get on

789
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:13,250
the box that means they win they get to

790
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,500
their target in contrast what you want

791
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,000
to do is think okay let's say implement

792
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,860
privilege separation let's say it works

793
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,860
I don't know sixty percent of the time

794
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,689
what you'll then see is in as a counter

795
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,219
the attacker either has to skin for

796
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,980
whatever reachable data they can get

797
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,750
from their current privileges or they

798
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,720
use some sort of let's say known exploit

799
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,490
which say works 50 percent of the time

800
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,900
then what you can say is okay if we know

801
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,240
they're gonna do that then we'll

802
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,580
implement something like G R Seck which

803
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,650
is as someone said like G R Seck makes

804
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,300
it so unusable for the actual user it

805
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:47,210
makes it impossible for an attacker as

806
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:50,030
well so let's say it works like 98

807
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:52,340
percent of the time so the other option

808
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,230
is you can use something like set comm

809
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,629
that works say 50 percent of the time if

810
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:59,240
you do that route let's say they use a

811
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,940
one day which is like not super fresh o

812
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,320
day and that works let's say 10 percent

813
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,940
of the time or they use it 10 percent of

814
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,399
the time and then they can also have

815
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,830
O'Day and that gets them to a win with G

816
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,150
R Seck they have what I call elite o day

817
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,679
because it's generally you get extra

818
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,230
props if you have something that also

819
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,820
works with G R Seck up and that say like

820
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:20,360
they'll use that two percent of the time

821
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:22,460
so the whole idea with this here I'm

822
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,429
happy to answer questions about this at

823
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,100
the end is really thinking about how can

824
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:29,840
you force the attacker to that very far

825
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,580
can be right or left depending on how

826
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,949
you go like how can we force them to

827
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:38,669
have to use elite O'Day

828
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:40,410
so it's me when I think about how do you

829
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,350
create a decision tree I've actually

830
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:44,730
done this for consulting a few times and

831
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,350
it seems to work pretty well as first

832
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,970
thinking about what assets do our

833
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,560
attackers actually want it's also

834
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:51,210
thinking about like what do we what

835
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,580
about what assets do we care but it's

836
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,500
really like what will the attacker tried

837
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,689
to get and the important important

838
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,460
clarification there is also may be

839
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,660
attackers want some sort of asset you

840
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,640
haven't you don't really care if they

841
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,100
take it that's valid it's part of your

842
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,350
own threat model and like building in or

843
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,719
drawing in business context you need to

844
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,740
be aware of what that is the second

845
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,480
thing what's the easiest way for

846
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,850
attackers to get those assets obviously

847
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,250
the yellow branch that's like a very

848
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:19,139
easy way then what countermeasures are

849
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,030
on that path think about what like

850
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,470
defensive procedures you currently have

851
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:25,860
do you have red limited privilege

852
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:28,980
separation do you have like IDs anything

853
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:31,199
like that then what new path will the

854
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,000
attack or take given that mitigation so

855
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,740
you've if you have IDs what are they

856
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,200
going to do instead and create a new

857
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,970
branch for that my idea is you repeat

858
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,250
one through four until you create that

859
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:43,110
path or they as I put it have to use a

860
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:46,020
day all the way down like again force

861
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,639
them to use that elite Oh days like what

862
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,620
does that path look like what are the

863
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,600
mitigations on that path then you assign

864
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,050
very very rough probabilities so you can

865
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,790
kind of think about what's realistic

866
00:31:54,050 --> 00:32:01,680
I've gotten questions before like how do

867
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:04,889
you draw this out so I use PowerPoint

868
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:07,200
it's very inefficient obviously good if

869
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:08,550
you're presenting in PowerPoint but you

870
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,030
can use white boards and then camera

871
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:14,610
snaps right a huge do not erase draw dot

872
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,020
IO and Gliffy have plugs into confluence

873
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:18,510
which can be useful if you're a Jewish

874
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,550
or like Atlassian shop there's Google

875
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,440
Docs they allow for like insert drawings

876
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,629
so if you're using a lot of like Google

877
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,490
slides Google Docs that's useful and

878
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,110
then Visio I hate Visio apparently I

879
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,110
learned after presenting this at

880
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:33,300
blackhat some people actually like Visio

881
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:36,780
that was shocking but you can also use

882
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,010
Visio but I really think strong that

883
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,110
that decision trees help create a

884
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:41,580
feedback loop to refine strategy

885
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,050
thinking it's thinking through your

886
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,270
assumptions thinking through how you're

887
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:47,610
thinking about attackers allowing you to

888
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:50,210
go back and check those assumptions as

889
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:52,590
you get new data as the reality changes

890
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,660
so in particular it helps for auditing

891
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:56,129
after some sort of incident so you can

892
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,080
think about okay where did our thinking

893
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:01,020
actually go wrong like what mitigations

894
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,850
did we have what we overlooked it also

895
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,250
helps ensure I think a big problem in

896
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:07,770
info second technology in general is

897
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,809
that we take additive only approaches

898
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,070
and we don't really revisit what do we

899
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:12,450
currently have like there countless

900
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,428
times I've heard of people saying like

901
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,500
yeah apparently we're using some

902
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:17,580
technology from say 2006 but we never

903
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,160
thought to get rid of it and you're

904
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,110
still even maybe paying for it um but it

905
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:26,280
helps ensure that you've actually mapped

906
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:28,649
that out it also helps if there's like

907
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,418
again as I said a historical record of

908
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,640
your decision-making process which is

909
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:34,950
super important I think I have another

910
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,320
talk where I talk about like the how to

911
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,760
make decisions and groups I think it's

912
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,799
also really important from a group

913
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,419
decision-making perspective but this is

914
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,490
kind of like an objective collaborative

915
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:45,929
thing rather than like oh well it was my

916
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,240
assumption that whatever you can't point

917
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:49,530
fingers as much it's like no we agreed

918
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,150
that this is kind of like our threat

919
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,879
model this was our decision tree and it

920
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,770
makes it more neutral it also mitigates

921
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,380
I think the doubling down effect where

922
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,870
it's like okay well we had whatever sort

923
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:03,419
of strategy like with Equifax let's say

924
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:05,280
they this was obviously not true but uh

925
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:07,140
obviously fire I believe they were a

926
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,659
testimonial for fire I so it's like okay

927
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:12,149
well if we just had fire I maybe that

928
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,830
wasn't the best strategy and it helps to

929
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:16,589
show we thought that that would mitigate

930
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:18,629
whatever was going to happen obviously

931
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,710
it didn't so let's rethink what the

932
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:21,359
branches actually are in what

933
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:26,010
countermeasures we can put in place

934
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,480
instead the big ideas defenders the

935
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,340
defenders advantage as you know the home

936
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,350
turf I realize that's not always true

937
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,540
even for a fortune 500s

938
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,940
but that should be the strength which

939
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,469
you tried to leverage so again it's you

940
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,330
want to visualize the hardest path for

941
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:41,219
attackers and how can you force them

942
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:43,500
onto that path leveraging the fact that

943
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,029
you understand your own environment then

944
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,070
looking at the commonalities on trees

945
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,379
like during some of the exercises I've

946
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,570
done things like two-factor will come up

947
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:53,940
on almost every tree like it's almost

948
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:55,409
always it's useful somewhere so it's

949
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,050
thinking about like how can you get the

950
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:59,850
most ROI for whatever security product

951
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,850
you're using by cutting off the most

952
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:06,790
attack

953
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:08,980
as possible so another idea is with

954
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:11,950
these decision trees let's make them the

955
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,420
new quote-unquote nice report so it's a

956
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,850
new request if you do outsource

957
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:19,210
penetration testing which I believe tobe

958
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:21,220
in date said probably not to do you can

959
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,510
ask them to do it you have a red team I

960
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,270
think it's very valuable

961
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:27,760
to then ask them like not just how did

962
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,440
you get to whatever the goal was it's

963
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,480
also what did you do that didn't work

964
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,830
what did you encounter like what

965
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,540
countermeasure actually works

966
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,549
what were the rabbit holes you went down

967
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,600
that didn't pan out because maybe

968
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,910
there's something that you don't even

969
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,759
realize is working and if they can

970
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:44,770
articulate that that's great it helps

971
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,600
you again to see that sort of attacker

972
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:51,070
perspective or alternative perspective

973
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:53,860
of your defenses and where to improve so

974
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:55,450
learning exploitation again that was

975
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,220
about thinking exploitation which is

976
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:03,540
before you've actually had prior

977
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:06,310
experiences with your opponent this is a

978
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,360
has two specific types of exploitation I

979
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,310
would say so there's information

980
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,410
asymmetry exploitation which is

981
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:14,230
disrupting the attacker learning process

982
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,089
so attackers learn just like everyone

983
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:18,370
else they factor past experiences into

984
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,680
their model how can you give kind of

985
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:22,900
like make that process not work then

986
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,270
there's learning rate exploitation which

987
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,730
is basically you can make those past

988
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,140
experiences unreliable and play on the

989
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:31,990
fact that they have that learning rate

990
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:34,540
in to how they learn and introduce

991
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:36,160
unreliability into that data and start

992
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,320
to actually preempt their moves which is

993
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,399
more of the long-term thing but what

994
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,160
you're trying to do really is make sure

995
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,330
that their model isn't accurate

996
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,609
so again exploit the fact that you

997
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:48,190
understand the local environment better

998
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:52,540
than attackers one way is through

999
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:54,550
falling falsifying data when we think of

1000
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,560
asymmetry and InfoSec I think we often

1001
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:59,860
think of the fact that attackers know

1002
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,110
way more about us than vice-versa but I

1003
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,370
think there's actually a chance to

1004
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:06,580
reverse that so there's been some

1005
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:08,049
research that looked into jammers and I

1006
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,000
think it's what it's got energy

1007
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:12,760
harvesting communication systems which

1008
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,980
is not obviously the InfoSec domain but

1009
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,630
what they found is attackers are

1010
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,750
really really reliant in that case on

1011
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:20,520
the disclosed power level of the device

1012
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,770
in order to actually jam it somebody

1013
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,869
came do is actually start falsifying

1014
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,190
that level of power and the attackers

1015
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,920
can actually conduct their attack

1016
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:31,950
appropriately so the idea of leveraging

1017
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,510
that the McCrone campaign is a case

1018
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,700
study and keep in mind I don't think we

1019
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:38,040
ever got confirmation that they actually

1020
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,379
did this but they said they did so let's

1021
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,380
assume that they did they allegedly used

1022
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,880
phishing tarp hitting so they when they

1023
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,300
signed on to phishing pages they used

1024
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,890
true and false logins and passwords they

1025
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,590
also planted fake documents like I think

1026
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:55,109
one was they had like a Silk Road order

1027
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:56,280
which was very obviously bogus they also

1028
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:58,710
used to fake languages in their

1029
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,800
documents like Cyrillic just to make it

1030
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:05,369
very hard to verify everything really

1031
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:08,400
this plays into the Twitter phenomenon

1032
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:10,530
last year which was waste his time 2016

1033
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,900
but it's for hackers so if you weren't

1034
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:15,000
aware of this the idea was that let's

1035
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,800
say like a guy's not texting you back or

1036
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,619
stringing you along something like that

1037
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,060
you waste his time you have him spent

1038
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:22,859
like by you would dinner or something

1039
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,840
else or just in general like different

1040
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:26,940
strategies to uh waste his time

1041
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,220
similarly to how he was wasting gears

1042
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,760
the idea here is doing that for

1043
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,049
attackers the goal is to really like

1044
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,000
throw a wrench into the attacker

1045
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,430
scientific method so they can't test

1046
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,920
their hypotheses so the goal really is

1047
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:43,169
to make it so the attacker doesn't know

1048
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:47,580
why they're failing and have them keep

1049
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:48,330
expending resources to find out so some

1050
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,250
of the things here like kind of

1051
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:52,319
attackers probing the system you can

1052
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:54,690
create custom email rejection messages

1053
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,490
and then what you can do is create a

1054
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,670
honey doc on let's say the a block

1055
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:01,020
policy and you post that somewhere so

1056
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,240
when they google that and they hit that

1057
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,680
honey dot you can be like okay someone's

1058
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,118
actually probing this system like they

1059
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,859
clearly got that error message we know

1060
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:11,220
that we should be like a little more

1061
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:12,660
careful or be watching out for that yeah

1062
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,879
it basically for any of these you want

1063
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:18,180
to track when it was accessed the idea

1064
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,760
also is a long-term if you use these

1065
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,500
honey documents honey tokens like thinks

1066
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,810
Canaries that look to describe

1067
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,369
legitimate policies or technologies that

1068
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,900
would be useful an attacker recon and

1069
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:29,400
particularly if you can have

1070
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,200
kind of go through the different steps

1071
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,789
an attacker would need to conduct you

1072
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:37,189
can start understanding kind of like the

1073
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:37,190
timing and pacing of your attackers

1074
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:46,859
non-determinism is another aspect of

1075
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:48,119
this so uh non-determinism basically

1076
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:49,859
means like there are different behaviors

1077
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:53,880
at different times and you can't expect

1078
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:55,740
the same results every time a SLR is a

1079
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,210
non deterministic feature it's one of

1080
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,680
the more I would say famous ones and

1081
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,390
securities but it's also highly

1082
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,460
deterministic in that it works the same

1083
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,680
way every time but I want to amplify

1084
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,740
that and extend it to kind of a higher

1085
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:09,569
level in thinking about security so the

1086
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,939
goal here is to screw up attacker

1087
00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:13,589
profiling so you want to raise the cost

1088
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,960
of attack at the very first step which

1089
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:17,940
is recon so you make the attacker and

1090
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,779
certain of your defensive profile in

1091
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:24,690
your environment as an example a lot of

1092
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:26,190
malware is now designed to look to see

1093
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,349
if they're in a VM or like a malware

1094
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:31,920
analyst sandbox and it won't run because

1095
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:33,660
it doesn't want to be caught so a good

1096
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,369
strategy is to make everything look like

1097
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:37,950
a malware analyst in box because then it

1098
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:39,690
will never run a better strategy is make

1099
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,480
it look like a different malware analyst

1100
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,999
sandbox every time so you can only

1101
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,609
afford so many like 4 to $50,000

1102
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:50,700
appliances so it's a lot easier some way

1103
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:52,069
if you put wolf skins on the sheep as I

1104
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,629
put it

1105
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:56,549
the idea is you mix and match hollow

1106
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:58,410
like a very superficial meaning that

1107
00:40:56,549 --> 00:41:00,720
it's not actually the program but it's

1108
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:02,339
just artifacts of the program but like

1109
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,529
sketchy-looking from the perspective of

1110
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:07,019
the attacker the malware artifacts on

1111
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:09,989
like a normal physical system so think

1112
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:11,549
about your typical employees there

1113
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:13,619
aren't too many tools around this but

1114
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:15,480
this is one of them and it really just

1115
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:18,150
helps you emulate virtual artifacts on

1116
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,759
dividual physical machines the unprotect

1117
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,619
project also has kind of lists of what

1118
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:25,019
those virtual artifacts are specifically

1119
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:30,359
what malware is looking for most

1120
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:32,819
commonly this is also a list so you can

1121
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:34,109
add in things like Wireshark fiddler but

1122
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:36,569
these are a bunch of executables that

1123
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:39,239
have been found work it's been found

1124
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:40,769
malware is looking for like vmware all

1125
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:41,430
that stuff you can also those are like

1126
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:43,229
typical

1127
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,859
address prefixes so you can change that

1128
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:49,710
you can just create like different dll's

1129
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:51,750
you also um yeah more stuff that you can

1130
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,430
create you can create like fake Drive

1131
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,900
stuff like that and again the idea is

1132
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,720
that you mix and match these just to

1133
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:59,010
make it really really confusing because

1134
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,419
I have attackers like okay why isn't

1135
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:02,309
this running like why are we not able to

1136
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,020
do this across like all of these systems

1137
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:07,190
it's gonna be really hard to figure out

1138
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:09,569
like what the machines actually are

1139
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:12,359
debuggers are also an example of

1140
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:13,920
something that you can emulate so they

1141
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:15,750
registered like certain driver objects

1142
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,650
so you can pretend that you have those

1143
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,819
and they it's pretty nice in that a lot

1144
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:23,910
of times when you're looking at the

1145
00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:25,529
reverse like Mao or like people writing

1146
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,480
malware that are like okay how can we

1147
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:29,490
look to see a debugger they'll find oh

1148
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,650
yeah you know it's always you know a

1149
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:34,709
function of it's a 1 or a 0 as far as

1150
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:36,690
like what the like what the structure is

1151
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,190
set to and so that means you can be

1152
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,960
extra reliable on the other side and

1153
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:43,740
just always have it be a 1 rather than a

1154
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:45,780
0 so it makes it pretty simple and also

1155
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:47,308
low dll's from AV engines and make it

1156
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,020
look like you have either like all

1157
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:51,390
antivirus or a bunch of different types

1158
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,799
which can also be confusing um it's

1159
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:55,348
pretty easy to find these but these are

1160
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:57,180
some of the most common of like endpoint

1161
00:42:55,349 --> 00:42:59,760
protection agents or AV agents that I

1162
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:01,680
was able to find the idea here is to you

1163
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,540
could have a forwarder DLL so basically

1164
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,730
you have one DLL which loads a bunch of

1165
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:08,910
different other ones again you can maybe

1166
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:10,710
choose at random you can also deploy

1167
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:12,210
like the lightest weight hypervisor you

1168
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,790
have because malware also looks for that

1169
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:16,950
um I haven't used any of these but these

1170
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:23,480
all seem to be pretty good but this is

1171
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:23,480
just like added wolf skin then minimax

1172
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:30,510
you may have heard it also as maxi min

1173
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:33,270
it's by john von neumann who's like a

1174
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:35,579
notable polymath basically assumed that

1175
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:37,369
each player chooses their strategy in a

1176
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:39,240
position of complete ignorance

1177
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:41,220
concerning like the other players

1178
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,990
choices and so the other player has to

1179
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,779
choose safely

1180
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:48,419
the idea is you minimize the possible

1181
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:51,000
loss for a worst-case maximum loss

1182
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,349
scenario so you want to minimize given

1183
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,060
like you're assuming complete

1184
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:57,270
catastrophe

1185
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:00,450
um so Dan Gere had a paper that actually

1186
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:02,070
looked at this for calculating risk via

1187
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:04,830
evolutionary risk management functions

1188
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:07,470
which partly inspired my resilience talk

1189
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:09,660
on Thursday and it examines mini FAQs

1190
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:11,790
max functions so you want to find the

1191
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,129
minimum of the sum of the expected cost

1192
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:16,020
of protection the expected cost of non

1193
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:18,810
protection so basically if you have like

1194
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,310
a a cost curve for like the expected

1195
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,110
cost of non protection than expected

1196
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:23,610
costs of protection they're going to be

1197
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,350
slightly different so it's like the cost

1198
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,540
of a breach first the cost of the

1199
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:31,230
security products you're spending on

1200
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:33,750
which you're spending money and some of

1201
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:35,580
the conclusions from here your dan gear

1202
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:38,130
cited that one ideas you don't have a

1203
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,840
monoculture I talked about this idea of

1204
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:41,340
diversity a bit more than the talk from

1205
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,560
two days ago it's on my Twitter if you

1206
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:46,170
want to see it's very beneficial for

1207
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,029
protection there is a trade-off with

1208
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,070
efficiency here and I think that's very

1209
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:52,170
much so up for debate it's not the

1210
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,090
context of this talk stochastic

1211
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,160
decisions or random decisions can be

1212
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,570
better than deterministic ones again as

1213
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,640
we saw they're at least equally as good

1214
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:02,670
as game theory and it could be helpful

1215
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:06,270
to throw off attackers then from the

1216
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:07,380
imitation game the idea would be so in

1217
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:09,570
the imitation game basically you have

1218
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,880
the Enigma machine you can like figure

1219
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,350
out what the Germans are doing but you

1220
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,330
don't want to act on that information

1221
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:17,460
all the time because they'll figure out

1222
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,990
the fact that you know you're obviously

1223
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,560
having access to that sort of

1224
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,770
information

1225
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:25,440
you also don't never you don't want to

1226
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:27,060
use it none of the time because you want

1227
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,620
to have some sort of advantage so it's

1228
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,870
like what's the balance between using it

1229
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,400
some of the time most of the time and

1230
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:37,410
they talk about that in the imitation

1231
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,900
game and finally looking ahead so this

1232
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:42,240
is thinking about how to use these sorts

1233
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:45,750
of behavioral strategies this framework

1234
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,970
going forward fluctuating infrastructure

1235
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:50,070
using emerging tech which i think is i

1236
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:52,049
don't think it's been solidified yet but

1237
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:54,930
seems to be called infrastructure 3.0

1238
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:56,370
like containers is one way netflix is

1239
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:59,009
chaos monkey another thing i talked

1240
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:01,020
about that other talk makes it really

1241
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,430
difficult for attackers to persist so

1242
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:05,400
the idea with chaos monkey is basically

1243
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:07,149
it kills instances at random so you

1244
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,950
basically have a lot of like tearing

1245
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,560
up and down again it makes it very hard

1246
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:13,569
for persistence which is great as far as

1247
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,130
defending against attackers this notion

1248
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,960
of fluctuating infrastructure you never

1249
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:19,390
have the same sort of environment at any

1250
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:23,110
one time so again it really really hurts

1251
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:25,180
attacker profiling I think the dream is

1252
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:26,920
modeling at actor cognition verse model

1253
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,319
tracing like really getting towards

1254
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,820
predicting attacker actions I don't

1255
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,620
think we're anywhere close to there we

1256
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:36,040
have to start being able to collect the

1257
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:38,350
data so I think thinks for example makes

1258
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:40,330
these canary tokens you can actually

1259
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:43,750
create your own I have a bunch they're

1260
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:45,730
super useful but it helps in the prior

1261
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,960
example of again like you have some sort

1262
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,940
of penny tokens to try to figure out

1263
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,010
okay what reconnaissance activities as

1264
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,720
an attacker conducting you can start to

1265
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,160
model out kind of like the process that

1266
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,910
they're going through again the timing

1267
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,529
and so forth the idea is also again that

1268
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:01,600
preference has changed based on

1269
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:03,730
experience so what you can do is

1270
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,740
sometimes like not block a certain

1271
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:08,440
attack or action and see do they perform

1272
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,819
that detection action again so you want

1273
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,460
to incorporate what's called the post

1274
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:13,840
decision state which is like the

1275
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,570
attacker has either received like a

1276
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:18,460
success or fail feedback you want to

1277
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:20,830
figure out how they're going to respond

1278
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,420
to that also they hire the attackers

1279
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:24,580
learning rate it's easier to predict

1280
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:26,830
their decisions generally the learning

1281
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:29,650
rate is slightly variable between people

1282
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:31,750
so it's good to figure out and start to

1283
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:33,220
calculate how much those sorts of prior

1284
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:35,680
decisions will factor into their

1285
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:37,689
decision making you also don't have to

1286
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,000
assume like initial attacker preferences

1287
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:42,310
based on empirical research so in that

1288
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,860
prior example with the random equals

1289
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:47,290
game theory results I think of as

1290
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:49,810
initial preferences only change to the

1291
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:53,320
outcomes by one percent or something so

1292
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:56,320
it's pretty much negligible so the the

1293
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:58,210
brief formula here is basically the the

1294
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,430
change in the expected utility of an

1295
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,780
offensive action basically like how much

1296
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,970
an attacker wants to use a specific

1297
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:06,550
action it's basically the learning rate

1298
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:08,980
times the feedback like I says tests or

1299
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,810
failure - the currently the current

1300
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,970
expected utility so basically it'll

1301
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:14,080
change based on whatever the attackers

1302
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,700
learning rate is how much they

1303
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,180
incorporate prior experience into the

1304
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,089
model

1305
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:20,290
times like success - like how much they

1306
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:22,960
already wanted to perform

1307
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:25,450
than action so for example if the

1308
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,090
learning rate is 20 percent which is

1309
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:31,210
roughly reasonable and then you just

1310
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:33,580
make like a success one and then a loss

1311
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:35,950
negative one then if an attacker

1312
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,960
successfully performs an action learning

1313
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,120
rates 20 percent it means that the

1314
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,890
attackers 20 percent more likely to do

1315
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,960
whatever the action is going forward

1316
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,580
then from here based on what you

1317
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,590
actually see like how likely they are to

1318
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,569
continue performing certain actions over

1319
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:52,300
time you can start to adjust that

1320
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:54,730
learning rate start to predict so the

1321
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:57,190
tricky part here is that they may

1322
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:59,170
respond more to losses than to gains I

1323
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:01,390
talked about prospect theory one of my

1324
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:04,030
other talks there hasn't been a lot of

1325
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:05,470
work on that yet and I think we're so

1326
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:07,840
far away from this point right now we

1327
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:09,580
don't have to worry about it but it'd be

1328
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:12,760
great to get to the point where they do

1329
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,960
or we do have to worry about it um so

1330
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,030
yeah you basically want to track the

1331
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,610
utility values for each attacker action

1332
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:20,920
and then for detected or blocked actions

1333
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:22,660
the attacker action and outcome are

1334
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,060
known variables so the utility is

1335
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,770
calculable obviously if you aren't aware

1336
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:29,350
it and attackers conducting an action

1337
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:31,090
you can't get to that point but at least

1338
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,770
then you can kind of start predicting if

1339
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:34,750
you're able to actually see an attackers

1340
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:36,700
actively conducting some sort of

1341
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,020
campaign hopefully you can start to

1342
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,339
predict what they're going to do

1343
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,560
particularly if you start to see

1344
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,000
commonalities between actions of

1345
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,330
compromises in the past versus the

1346
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:52,150
current one that would be super helpful

1347
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:53,940
so in conclusion despite the meme it's

1348
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:56,710
no longer time for some game theory

1349
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:59,530
we've also learned that game theory is a

1350
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:01,570
language not even a theory so it's me

1351
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:04,210
now you can sound extra pretentious at

1352
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:05,350
cocktail parties by saying that so if

1353
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,690
that's the one thing you take away

1354
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:09,130
that's fine with me

1355
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:11,290
so you start with a SWOT analysis to

1356
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:12,910
gain perspective of yourself in the

1357
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:16,420
context of your adversary and vice versa

1358
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:18,910
you use thinking exploitation to improve

1359
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,800
your threat modeling and you use

1360
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:22,480
learning exploitation to beleaguer your

1361
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,450
adversaries by messing with their

1362
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,980
ability to profile I think this is a

1363
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:29,020
collaborative effort so we have to work

1364
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:31,030
together to build strategies based on

1365
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,560
this behavioral framework I know that

1366
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,630
generally collaboration across the

1367
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,490
industry hasn't nest

1368
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:38,910
Shirley worked well but I think this is

1369
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:40,649
so this is such a new area that I think

1370
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:42,029
being able like even since I gave this

1371
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,769
talk at blackhat like hearing people's

1372
00:50:42,029 --> 00:50:45,420
strategies that they've already been

1373
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:46,979
testing in their own organization I

1374
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,869
think starting to talk to each other

1375
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:52,349
about how can we leverage these ideas is

1376
00:50:48,869 --> 00:50:53,880
really really important then uh the next

1377
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,230
step is how to begin model tracing

1378
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,359
attackers again the idea of the honey

1379
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:59,579
tokens tracking what their actions are

1380
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,869
that's super useful then finally

1381
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:02,099
hopefully we can start to predict

1382
00:51:00,869 --> 00:51:04,710
attacker behavior

1383
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:06,119
so I recommend try these at home make

1384
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:08,789
your blue team empirical like honestly

1385
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:09,900
the worst case is like random is just as

1386
00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:11,670
good as game theory you're probably

1387
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,349
doing something maybe based on game

1388
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:15,890
theory because a lot of strategy is so

1389
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:19,170
you might as well give it a shot and uh

1390
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:20,970
the quote I always like to close on is

1391
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:22,980
Dan gears which is good enough is good

1392
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:24,990
enough good enough always beats perfect

1393
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,430
the hard part is obviously determining

1394
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:28,439
what's good enough

1395
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:30,930
his goal was like self sufficiency not

1396
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,849
expertness and having a culture of

1397
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:35,250
measurement but the ideas even if

1398
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:36,750
however you implemented isn't perfect

1399
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:39,740
it's probably gonna be better than what

1400
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:42,420
you're doing so take the risk and try

1401
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:45,598
these so slides from black hat already

1402
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,920
online I'll also post these again so you

1403
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,349
don't necessarily have to take a picture

1404
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:53,390
now this is my various contact

1405
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:53,390
information with that thanks very much

1406
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:02,609
you
