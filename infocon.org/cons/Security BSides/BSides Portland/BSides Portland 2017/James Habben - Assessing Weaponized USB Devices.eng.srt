1
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,920
every bus how many of you right now

2
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:30,610
would take a thumb drive from me and

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:30,610
plug it into your computers Yolo right

4
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:38,419
so fortunately I'm not a a red teamer I

5
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,430
am focused on on blue team defense I

6
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,550
work for Verizon formerly known as risk

7
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,140
where digital forensics Incident

8
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,500
Response consulting firm much like

9
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,330
mandiant or straws or a crowd strike or

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:56,300
you name them

11
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:59,449
that's my intro so I found that's a

12
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,739
that's a default animation in keynote by

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:05,119
the way I just found that today I was

14
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:07,070
like oh that's perfect so the agenda for

15
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,380
today I'm gonna go over a couple of

16
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:13,189
things real quick on significance things

17
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,500
that we as Verizon see in mirrors cases

18
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:17,839
that I've seen in my consulting work

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,060
with customers with malicious USB

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,249
devices they are out there as Joe

21
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,679
indicated and as apparently the last

22
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:29,958
talk whence went on I didn't get a

23
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:33,560
chance to see that one so I'll go over

24
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:35,329
one of the scenarios I'm normally I've

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,709
given this in a few other places and

26
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:38,298
it's normally about an hour talk so I

27
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:40,459
got a I got a push through on this and

28
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,810
and make sure but I'll be outside if you

29
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:46,340
want to talk about anything else

30
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:48,439
definitely so DHS study back in 2011

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,469
they dropped a bunch of thumb drives out

32
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,689
and out in the parking lots yeah you can

33
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:57,859
see there the 60% of them got plugged in

34
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:59,148
and the ones with logos on them I think

35
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:01,249
they they indicated that their

36
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:05,060
government logos of some sort so you

37
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:07,279
know very trustworthy face right ninety

38
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,740
percent of those got plugged in kind of

39
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:10,579
a kind of a bad statistic any red

40
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,950
teamers in here

41
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,900
you've taken notes right put put

42
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:19,849
government logos on your USB sticks okay

43
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:24,260
so five years later you think you'd get

44
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:24,619
better it did come on give us some

45
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,290
credit

46
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:30,019
forty eight percent got plugged in

47
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,819
there's actually a great blog on this

48
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:34,819
from from some of the guys that did the

49
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:38,149
study there's a link in the the link

50
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:40,670
down here at the bottom Joe or you guys

51
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,319
showing shank slides through the through

52
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,328
the conference somewhere I'm happy to

53
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,890
give a PDF with the slides there's a

54
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:49,459
bunch of links and stuff in here so I'll

55
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,069
figure out some way to get that out some

56
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,409
of those thumb drives went in within

57
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,480
minutes as in like first thing as

58
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:58,010
they're getting in the door right forget

59
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,619
that email that's that's been waiting

60
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,420
all weekend long I gotta find out what's

61
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,190
on this thumb drive because there could

62
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:08,690
be something good I might need to tweet

63
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:11,540
about it you guys almost Stuxnet right

64
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,930
okay so USB was used in there it wasn't

65
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,480
a USB exploit so to say but there was a

66
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,049
link file exploit in there that

67
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,790
exploited how Microsoft Windows

68
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:25,159
interprets the icons as they're

69
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,709
referenced you can exploit you can

70
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,560
execute code by way of referencing an

71
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,590
export through a dll that's included on

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
your thumb drive that's that's been

73
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,760
patched since there was another one that

74
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,690
was similar after that but that was

75
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,099
conducted through a USB medium because

76
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,489
they were trying to get into that air

77
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:49,459
gap network so we've got nation-states

78
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,449
using this and we've got studies showing

79
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,989
that it's effective

80
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:55,579
we've got can't say if they're nation

81
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,220
states always but we've got other

82
00:03:55,579 --> 00:04:00,500
attackers using them as well so the

83
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,049
scenarios well first off the the

84
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,720
significance I'm Verizon right the DB IR

85
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:09,470
report I'd get fired if I didn't at

86
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,409
least mention it so this is one of the

87
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:16,399
the stats that we have in there this is

88
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:19,930
the the targets of compromises targets

89
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,969
of the breaches credentials right so I

90
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,940
categorize USB attacks like this as

91
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,949
phishing attacks same same category you

92
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,690
can put them in emails or you can put

93
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:33,680
them on a thumb drive you're convincing

94
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:36,110
someone to run or open or something that

95
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,090
that that piece of something that will

96
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,430
get something running on your computer

97
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,270
so credentials are the major source can

98
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,680
you get credentials with you

99
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:47,810
we drive yeah absolutely so here's a

100
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,370
here's a scenario you can read more

101
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,350
about this this is another Verizon

102
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,140
publication called the data breach

103
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,810
digest that talks more in depth about

104
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,640
the that some of the cases that we

105
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,830
actually work rather than the DB IR

106
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,669
which is which is more anonymized from

107
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:07,460
lots of people in short here because I'm

108
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:10,730
a little shorter on time a janitor at a

109
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:14,120
company was offered money to plug USB

110
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:19,030
drives into computers while going about

111
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,030
everyday business and it was effective

112
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:27,020
so the yet the the way this was a case

113
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,060
that we personally I didn't personally

114
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,090
work but Verizon handled the case for a

115
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,130
customer the the way they detected this

116
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,780
is the administrator logged on to one of

117
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,460
the infected machines and noticed an

118
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,169
extra command prompt you know the login

119
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,849
scripts that you do when you your domain

120
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:44,260
policies and all that kind of stuff he

121
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:48,680
noticed an extra one right how how

122
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:52,700
observant is that so that's that's how

123
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,950
they caught that this scenario was an

124
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:59,060
entertainment industry company which was

125
00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:01,760
a lot more elaborate of a set up here

126
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,500
they they were at a conference they

127
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,460
targeted an executive for the company

128
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,710
they had a booth they talked to the

129
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,380
executive they followed up with the

130
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:17,000
executive with letterhead sent him a

131
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:20,840
thumb drive plugged in and got a matter

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,520
Pradesh L back out and the quote down

133
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,169
here once the reverse shell had been

134
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,580
established it didn't take long for the

135
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,200
threat actor to start exfiltrating

136
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,979
gigabytes of data including an

137
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,570
unreleased movie it's a very serious

138
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,750
threat that's that's what I'm trying to

139
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,250
convey across it have I been successful

140
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,570
okay so those of you that raised your

141
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,780
hand would you take a thumb drive from

142
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,780
you now

143
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:51,640
yes it's only a 512 Meg though no all

144
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,960
right

145
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,810
so the attacks that can be conducted

146
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,690
with a USB there's the very simple and

147
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,500
and most likely the the most known to

148
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,440
you guys right now

149
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,200
is what I call file based or or logical

150
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,080
attacks and those are what we do

151
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:12,469
commonly see in phishing emails via PDF

152
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,859
files via office documents or via the

153
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,430
the linked file exploits or some other

154
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,710
zero-day or

155
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,860
one two three four five day whatever it

156
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:25,219
is at the time that is is not patched up

157
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,410
on that system so the the PDF files they

158
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,900
run they run scripts they allow for

159
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,610
event triggering all kinds of crazy

160
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,520
things just like the the office

161
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,440
documents they can they can do all kinds

162
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,930
of nasty stuff for some weird reason

163
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,520
they think that's a good idea but

164
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,530
anyways we're all very familiar with

165
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,820
those through the phishing emails so I

166
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,880
don't want to concentrate too much on

167
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,070
that because those are those are fairly

168
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,469
easy to address you throw throw them in

169
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,719
a sandbox throw them at antivirus throw

170
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,970
them into your your PDF or your word or

171
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,340
whatever analyzers you can inspect those

172
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,950
pretty well what I find most most people

173
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,989
don't have a real grasp on is the

174
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,120
hardware attacks that can be conducted

175
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,030
with USB some of you are probably

176
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,460
familiar some some devices out there

177
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,169
anyone the names

178
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,270
rubber ducky is is like the number one

179
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:18,920
most well-known device it was one of the

180
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:23,710
earlier devices another one Bosch yeah

181
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:27,830
bash bunny I heard some more USB armory

182
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:31,090
Raspberry Pi they have a zero Raspberry

183
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:34,970
Pi zero it's called so all all can be

184
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,929
used to conduct USB based attacks did

185
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,479
they talk about some of those in the

186
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:40,640
last talk those of you are there some of

187
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,410
those devices not so much other other

188
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,730
USB stuff okay what's that the face no

189
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,410
okay I'm not if I'm not familiar with

190
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,580
that one

191
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:54,300
gotcha okay I'll have to check that out

192
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:56,280
then the the physical attacks that that

193
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,359
can be conducted pretty easily by these

194
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,760
tools some of the ones that were

195
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,030
mentioned here and by many others that

196
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,220
that have been custom designed a USB

197
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,420
device can a thumb drive looking thing

198
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,450
can emulate a keyboard

199
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:13,110
and what's scary about that is you think

200
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:15,150
about how how do you run your highly

201
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,580
privileged scripts how do you run your

202
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:21,060
highly privileged programs and all those

203
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,980
sorts of things you type in right you

204
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,719
type or you use the mouse that's your

205
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,860
interface that's the human interface

206
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,160
into your computer so if a USB device

207
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:36,650
can can take the form of your keyboard

208
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,540
and your mouse and it can be scripted

209
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,880
that's pretty pretty serious right it

210
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,010
now has taken over the same privileges

211
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,840
the same permissions that you have as

212
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,220
your user the fingers that you're typing

213
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,130
with it can do anything that you're

214
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,720
doing so you're logged in to your domain

215
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,689
I'm an admin account it's got the world

216
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,610
right it's it's a very very serious

217
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,420
threat and the thing that makes it worse

218
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:02,310
there is no admin privileges required to

219
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,260
enable these things when's the last time

220
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,270
you plugged in an external keyboard or

221
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,400
plugged in an external mouse and it said

222
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,829
hey are you sure you want to use this

223
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,689
device yeah never right

224
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,150
none of the OS is unless you anyone use

225
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:18,990
cute was it cubes yeah does it I think

226
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:21,420
it does that doesn't it yeah I remember

227
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:25,040
seeing Joanna talk something about that

228
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:28,860
I haven't played much with that but a

229
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,510
little better okay cool so cubes check

230
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,270
that out it's a it's like a virtualizing

231
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,689
app type of operating system Linux ish

232
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:40,710
based type of thing helps to protect

233
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:43,560
about against these things the cd-rom is

234
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:47,280
a serious threat in this because windows

235
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,589
back in in XP timeframe allowed for what

236
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,170
we call auto run yeah you know I'll

237
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,520
remember that some of the the viruses

238
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,150
spread through that some of the virus

239
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,800
spreading things using USB did that way

240
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,540
they blocked it I believe it happened in

241
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,599
XP at one of the patched levels that

242
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,519
they blocked the odd

243
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,560
run it turned it off by default as a

244
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,130
Vista you can't actually turn that on

245
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,170
for USB storage right mass storage so

246
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:15,069
disk drives and thumb drives that you

247
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:17,349
plug in CD ROMs however still have auto

248
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:21,729
run available so you can turn those on

249
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,829
and USB devices can emulate CD ROMs you

250
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:27,490
the I think of sand disks that made the

251
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:31,870
U 3 USB devices those are all run on

252
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:34,569
cd-rom type of things so if you can get

253
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,310
a little menu thing with portable apps

254
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:39,509
loaded you think you could get something

255
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:42,518
else loaded oh yeah anything you want

256
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:46,540
and then the the last one is a little

257
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:48,190
more recent development in in the last

258
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,889
year so it's been developed a little bit

259
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:54,459
more started by mu bik's maybe making

260
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:56,589
that real popular he inserted through

261
00:11:54,459 --> 00:12:01,660
through one of those USB devices an

262
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:04,750
Ethernet adapter it sounds silly it

263
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,910
sounds innocuous right if you plug in an

264
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,889
Ethernet adapter but you don't have a

265
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:14,439
cable going to it what could it do

266
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:16,000
what's the worst that can happen so one

267
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:19,060
of the things that mu bik's made popular

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,029
is he found that if you plug in an

269
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:25,209
Ethernet adapter with a ridiculously

270
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:28,060
high speed rate as the operating system

271
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:29,619
sees it and then you emulate that it's

272
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,630
actually plugged in it's not going

273
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,120
anywhere right it's a virtual adapter it

274
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,069
doesn't even matter the operating sees

275
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,410
that super high-speed rate as the

276
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:42,610
priority device regardless of routing

277
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:46,240
tables so when you go and authenticate

278
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:49,389
all of your things it loops through that

279
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,399
emulated USB Ethernet device and then

280
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,259
that device sends it back out to the

281
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,560
real network so you know nothing

282
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:58,600
different so when's the last time you

283
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,040
got prompted for that USB Ethernet

284
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,420
device that you plugged into you are you

285
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,310
sure you want to use this never right

286
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:09,209
I'm hoping that changes in Windows or

287
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,209
something but anyways

288
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,350
what I'm presenting to you is a

289
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,570
methodology if you have a piece of

290
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,510
hardware in your hand that you feel

291
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,730
might be malicious I've got a

292
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,860
methodology that we use in in our labs

293
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:29,920
to assess these devices to make sure

294
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:34,360
we're not plugging volatile and and well

295
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:37,120
malicious items into our sacred systems

296
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,140
all right if you take some thumb drive

297
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,790
that comes to you if you're in a

298
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,770
forensics role and you take that and

299
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,110
plug it into your forensics machine you

300
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,360
are exposing your forensics machine to

301
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,670
the malicious threat if you don't do the

302
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,700
right things you are doing that now if

303
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,500
you are placing things in now so what I

304
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,120
want you to get out of this is a comfort

305
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,650
level that if someone hands you a USB

306
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,780
device and you don't know that person or

307
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:01,480
you don't know that device you can walk

308
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,520
away and say hey big deal I'll run

309
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,740
through this methodology and I'll know

310
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,720
is it malicious or is it not and I'll

311
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,700
know that in the process of doing that I

312
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,120
haven't compromised anything on my

313
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,500
systems so it's it's a little a little

314
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,350
bit of a lengthy process and it requires

315
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:22,150
some setup but you can't be too safe

316
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:24,850
right so the first step we want to

317
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,610
preserve anything that was on that disk

318
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:30,670
if this if these devices can be scripted

319
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,280
they can be scripted to go and wipe data

320
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,380
so what I want to do first is prevent

321
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,449
the scripts from actually running I want

322
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,230
to collect the data as much as I can off

323
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:42,580
of the the data portion of that device

324
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,860
so you need a physical machine

325
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,090
I run a Mac you can well you can't

326
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,450
really see it it's behind the podium

327
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:51,640
here I use fusion I don't do I don't

328
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,230
have any problems with it I always use

329
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,180
fusion for Windows I don't even boot

330
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,980
into boot camp I don't ever have to do

331
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,349
that this is one thing well I don't use

332
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,830
my Mac for this but throw away laptop

333
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:05,470
you need a physical machine use a Linux

334
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,150
boot CD to make it easy I use Linux just

335
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,110
cuz it's quick and easy to get the data

336
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,490
off you don't have to worry about

337
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,860
booting windows and all that kind of

338
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:15,070
stuff we're gonna use a hardware write

339
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,120
blocker this is an example of a hardware

340
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,160
write blocker right here

341
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,410
it's an inline write blocker it uses

342
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,150
power from the host computer and it

343
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,110
powers up the device and it just

344
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,490
prevents writes

345
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,130
going there that's the whole forensic

346
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,680
methodology I recommend though you get

347
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:32,019
something like the tableau right blocker

348
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,939
because it's got its own power source

349
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:35,829
you guys heard of that USB thing that

350
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,200
has the capacitors in it that can suck

351
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:39,939
up juice and then blamo it goes and

352
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,279
fries your computer well if you haven't

353
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,410
you have now so you don't want to plug

354
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,470
that into your $10,000 forensics system

355
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:49,959
now plug that into your tableau and let

356
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,610
that be a fuse replace your $200 right

357
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,518
block or rather than your $10,000

358
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,500
forensics machine so then your standard

359
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,450
collection of whatever tool you use to

360
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,970
do that next step

361
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:03,459
physical machine again this time we want

362
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,440
to run the maliciousness we want to find

363
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:07,180
out what it's trying to do so the

364
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,220
biggest target is Windows so that's

365
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,250
that's what we use and my

366
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,959
recommendations on here and are in the

367
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,040
the commas afterwards use a small hard

368
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:18,579
drive because the goal is you're gonna

369
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,529
acquire this drive actually twice so get

370
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:22,359
yourself a little 64 gig solid-state

371
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,700
something like that make it fast make it

372
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,170
small and then forensic wipe it out

373
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,329
first because that compresses a whole

374
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,959
lot better lessons learned through the

375
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:35,319
process use a software write blocker

376
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:37,390
this time the reason why the tableau

377
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,399
hardware or any of the hardware write

378
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,860
blockers are meant to talk USB

379
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:45,160
mass-storage they don't know how to talk

380
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:47,380
hid the human interface they don't know

381
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,660
how to talk CD ROMs they don't know how

382
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,120
to talk USB Ethernet they don't know how

383
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,819
to talk any of that they are purely

384
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,480
designed for USB mass-storage and only

385
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:00,670
to allow reads so it shelters all of

386
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,610
that other potential maliciousness out

387
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:05,619
you just get the logical data here we

388
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,540
want it so I want a software write

389
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:08,979
blocker you can use that registry hack

390
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,530
that's out there just google that

391
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,630
registry hack USB write block or

392
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,428
something like that you'll find it in

393
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,689
case has a write blocker built into it

394
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:18,939
if you have that it doesn't require a

395
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:22,059
dongle so you can use that without the

396
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,470
dongle we want the stuff to run but we

397
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:26,319
still use a write blocker because you

398
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:28,870
know forensics and stuff collect a

399
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,850
before image of your disk and your RAM

400
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,320
and then prep any of your collection

401
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,270
tools this is kind of like malware

402
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,820
sandboxing but you're doing it on a

403
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:39,940
actual hardware system so if you've got

404
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,110
any system any scripts or frameworks or

405
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,210
anything like that that you like to use

406
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,428
for doing malware sandboxing put them

407
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,690
all on and then the other thing i'm

408
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:49,179
gonna present to you along with this

409
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,100
methodology is number six a PowerShell

410
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:52,960
script that is going to make assessing

411
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:58,389
the hardware maliciousness of these

412
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:01,270
devices incredibly easy once you start

413
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:03,220
up all that stuff insert your USB let it

414
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,720
recognize the drivers run through all

415
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,780
that give it a minute two minutes

416
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,910
something along those lines and then

417
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,889
stop the the PowerShell script finish

418
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,710
your volatile collection tools and then

419
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,940
do another hard drive collection and

420
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,620
your memory collection because you're

421
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,860
going to do a differential of the clean

422
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,870
versus the dirty and of the disk and of

423
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,340
the memory and then from there you're

424
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:32,260
just gonna do your standard find evil

425
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:33,939
with your the file contents of your the

426
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,290
acquisition from the disk look for any

427
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,360
of the files in there running through

428
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,730
your AV scans that's a it's a low effort

429
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,649
to result ratio right you can click a

430
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,570
button or something like that five

431
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,250
minutes to kick off an AV scan let it go

432
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,379
in the background doesn't cost you any

433
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:51,070
more time you surprise it here

434
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:53,520
consultants say that we don't build for

435
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:56,080
machine time so it makes the job cheap

436
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,970
if that doesn't come up with anything

437
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,510
then you can run through io c-- searches

438
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:04,480
or then dig into your PDF or office

439
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:07,690
document specific tools to analyze some

440
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,510
maliciousness of those files if you

441
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:14,530
don't find anything there get into the

442
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:16,540
the disk of your sacrificial system look

443
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,700
at the disk images compare them compare

444
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,590
the memory images compare your volatile

445
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,659
tools see what might have gotten started

446
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,790
for processes what files got created

447
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:26,440
what registry entries all that standard

448
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:30,460
stuff when you're looking for evil on a

449
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,850
system and also review the output from

450
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,750
the PowerShell the the last thing here

451
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,610
collects firmware

452
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,070
this is the this is the really really

453
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:41,139
super deep that that I'm not very good

454
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:43,059
at myself but I have people for that and

455
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,190
probably the guys that we're talking

456
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:47,678
before me are one of those people not

457
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,059
not not my people but but they're

458
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,690
probably the type of people you want to

459
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,918
make friends with

460
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,799
if you need to start doing this type of

461
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,509
thing there are thumb drive controllers

462
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:59,019
the the USB controllers out there the

463
00:19:55,509 --> 00:20:01,330
most well-known is fives on pH ISO n

464
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:05,710
there is a talk about this at shmoocon

465
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:08,740
in 2015 about how you can reprogramming

466
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:11,980
these controllers in the field to become

467
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,379
cd-roms to become HIDs and then you can

468
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,090
rewrite the firmware on there to include

469
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:18,158
scripts and in fact there's actually a

470
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:21,459
tool now that'll take the rubber ducky

471
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,259
scripts and compile them into firmware

472
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,080
that can get loaded on to a files on

473
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:28,059
controller thumb drive that costs like

474
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,620
five dollars on Amazon the challenge is

475
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:31,450
just finding one of those that has the

476
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,820
flies on it's not used across the board

477
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,220
so you might have to buy a few dozen and

478
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:39,399
hope for hope for one of them being

479
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,929
being it so if you if you can't find bad

480
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:43,149
and anything else and you're still

481
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:45,549
convinced that there's a problem on this

482
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:48,129
thing then you can go after the firmware

483
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,379
the easiest way to do this is a program

484
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:52,269
there called chip easy be very careful

485
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:55,029
where you get this from I've got a slide

486
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:57,070
in a few that that gives you the URL

487
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:59,710
don't get it from anywhere else

488
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,990
it's a sketchy looking URL give you that

489
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:06,220
the one that I'm gonna show you but

490
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:08,529
there's worse so the chip easy I've got

491
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,299
a picture of it too it tells you the the

492
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:12,669
controller that's on there it tells you

493
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:15,700
the size it tells you all kinds of good

494
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:17,799
stuff about that it gives you URLs to

495
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:22,080
the tools that will allow you to dump

496
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:24,940
the firmware out there for analysis and

497
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:31,210
then the easiest part number four just

498
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:33,370
re the firmware okay so before I get

499
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,169
into the PowerShell some of the PDF file

500
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,719
tools that you can use if you're not

501
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,700
familiar with analyzing PDF files

502
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,679
didier Stevens actually has a quite a

503
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,590
few blog posts on it he's got a lot of

504
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:50,019
information on all that so it's a great

505
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:52,449
site to use my favorite is this pppp PDF

506
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:57,900
I always have trouble saying this p:p

507
00:21:52,450 --> 00:22:02,760
PDF whatever peep-peep II okay

508
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:04,380
now on video saying that so that's my

509
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,150
that's my favorite he does a lot of cool

510
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,970
stuff in that there's an interactive

511
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:12,270
shell it's it's a real real fun one to

512
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:16,110
work with for office files my favorite

513
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:19,770
again up here is the Des Lodge allayed

514
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:22,110
tools he's he's got his he was on that

515
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:25,500
bitbucket before but he's modernized and

516
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,620
now on on github any bitbucket fins in

517
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,620
here

518
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,350
didier again has some tools down here

519
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,910
that will allow you to dump some of

520
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,320
those things out this talk isn't on that

521
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:36,840
I don't have enough time for that but

522
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,850
those are really good tools to use so

523
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,209
here's a picture of the chip easy only

524
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:45,480
get chip easy from that site I told you

525
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:48,210
it looks sketchy right dot see see where

526
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,440
is that from China

527
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,910
yeah it looks sketchy is all hell but

528
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,700
that's actually the legit site you'll

529
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:59,100
you'll find a ton of downloads offered

530
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:03,840
from dot are use and diet who knows what

531
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:06,360
so yeah only get it from there but you

532
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:12,030
can see here some of the stuff and for

533
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,559
example right here so it tells you the

534
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,440
Phi's on controller can everyone see

535
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,178
that in the back is that big enough this

536
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,030
this program was actually designed

537
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:23,429
because there are people that will get

538
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:26,970
thumb drives and reprogram the firmware

539
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:29,340
to let's say it's a physically a one gig

540
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,530
thumb drive they'll go and reprogram it

541
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,169
to represent a 64 gig and then they'll

542
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:36,510
sell it sell it on eBay as a 64 gig for

543
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,130
a lot more money so this this tool is

544
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:41,340
used by a lot of people to check those

545
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:42,630
things out and yeah it obviously gives

546
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,510
you the tools to do that

547
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:48,210
so the the URL down here it goes to the

548
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:50,970
same site usually where they have the

549
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,220
they host up the the firmware tools in

550
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:58,890
order to download and reprogram the

551
00:23:53,220 --> 00:24:01,170
firmware here is the PowerShell script

552
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:04,320
you can find it on my my github gist

553
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:07,140
page it's a really stupidly simple

554
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,879
PowerShell it's got about three lines of

555
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,239
function

556
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:12,978
but another like 20 or 30 lines of

557
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:15,949
making things pretty you guys know how

558
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:19,039
that goes I get a list of the plug in

559
00:24:15,949 --> 00:24:21,619
play devices PNP right plug and play

560
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:25,729
devices that's all USB thinks I get a

561
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:27,439
list before you plug it in I pause you

562
00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:29,299
plug it in give it a give it a minute

563
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,669
right it recognizes all those things I

564
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:33,369
go once you continue I get another list

565
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:35,869
of all this plug and play devices and

566
00:24:33,369 --> 00:24:37,218
then there's even a function in

567
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:39,289
PowerShell that says get me a

568
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:41,449
differential between these two variables

569
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:43,489
like I said three lines of code it's

570
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:48,049
it's nothing amazing but it makes this

571
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:51,139
process incredibly fast so it dumps out

572
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:52,819
a quick list of the differences and then

573
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:55,008
it gives you the full properties

574
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:57,529
everything that's stored inside the the

575
00:24:55,009 --> 00:25:04,339
plug-and-play properties so here's an

576
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:06,649
example of that output you can see some

577
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:07,879
things like the USB store up there's for

578
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:10,458
those of you familiar with forensic

579
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:13,849
artifacts for every USB store there's

580
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:18,709
also a corresponding USB nan store okay

581
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:20,599
and then you've got the the W pad Enuma

582
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:22,549
all that kind of stuff so this is the

583
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,168
the quick list on the top you can see

584
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:28,069
over there it says DIF list and then

585
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:31,309
long list down here it'll scroll for a

586
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:33,019
few pages with the full long list of all

587
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:35,389
the properties for each of those devices

588
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:38,779
so let me just pop through here real

589
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:41,748
quick you can see on this one you've got

590
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:43,579
just a USB and an HID there's no USB

591
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:45,079
store on there at all so if you're

592
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:50,089
plugging in a thumb drive and you don't

593
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:59,329
see a USB store but instead you see an

594
00:25:50,089 --> 00:26:03,279
HID and this is just a USB so it's just

595
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:03,279
a logical oh right down here

596
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:11,840
so that's a USB USB Ethernet that's

597
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:14,630
plugged in there so now the the slides

598
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,179
for what happens when you plug in some

599
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,190
of these devices the USB rubber ducky in

600
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,740
default configuration you can you can

601
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,750
program a lot of those things and change

602
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,760
if it's got storage or if it's not or

603
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,260
whatever else so over there you can see

604
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,820
there's a mass storage there's an input

605
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,650
there's a keyboard there's a disk drive

606
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,950
there's a volume there's ducky storage

607
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:37,190
clue right and then there's a composite

608
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:40,040
device one of the other devices the USB

609
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:42,440
the land turtle from hack five by

610
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:45,440
default it gives you in a nice a tap and

611
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,200
then also a Realtek Ethernet controller

612
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:53,120
again thumb drive Ethernet controller

613
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:55,910
hmm clue and then this is the USB armory

614
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,629
with the with the Ethernet enabled for

615
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:01,010
the 4mu bik's attack he ran this for me

616
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:05,150
on his devices because I don't have all

617
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:07,370
of those things and then I had some one

618
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:10,700
so I think someone gave me I didn't get

619
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:12,649
that slide in here the the most put

620
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:17,060
together attack using this method all

621
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:19,580
this mechanism is poison tap a guy by

622
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,350
the name of Sammy well known in the in

623
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,330
the industry here he put together a

624
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,490
framework that basically you install you

625
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,379
run an installer and you get it

626
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,450
installed on this device and it will

627
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,400
install poisoned cache in your

628
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:34,970
JavaScript history for the the top

629
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,650
million Alexa sites and so you've

630
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:39,710
basically got a JavaScript rat and

631
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:41,780
running now in your in your victims web

632
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:44,360
cache anytime they start up and go to

633
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:47,629
basically any site either ever write the

634
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,129
top million sites so then just show and

635
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,580
tell about some of these devices what

636
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,070
they look like

637
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,689
that's the armory and then the files on

638
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,389
controller and that's all the time I

639
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:58,080
have but happy to take questions out in

640
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,140
the hall or

641
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,139
you

642
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,350
you
