1
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:24,270
so thanks everybody for coming out this

2
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,980
will be a talk about my adventures in

3
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,450
hacking a couple badges before

4
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:33,070
conferences or as I like to put it

5
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,140
give my speaker notes but as I like to

6
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:49,170
call it doing too much in too little

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:53,470
time so let me see alright now I'm good

8
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,159
so I'm Rob rare aka medium rare I'm from

9
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,809
Chicago

10
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,600
but this is my first time in Portland

11
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:59,099
and I'm loving it hopefully I can make

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,720
it out here

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,970
more in the future I'm an electrical

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,770
computer and music engineer I work for

15
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,350
it as a global design firm called IDEO

16
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,210
where I get to do fun stuff like hack

17
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,679
cars and build medical equipment and

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:17,229
children's toys so I like that the

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,320
ability to keep widening whatever I'm

20
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:23,799
working on so this talk kind of starts

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,288
with DEFCON 24 and the end not the end

22
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:29,770
not X or bender badge I discovered this

23
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:30,880
project on Twitter and hack a day and as

24
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,899
I was kind of looking through it it

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,359
seemed like fun and they said they

26
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:36,909
wanted people to repurpose it

27
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:38,289
I wanted a free badge so to me that

28
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,210
sounded like I could probably trade

29
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:43,329
something in exchange if I did a cool

30
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,859
hack they announced what dev board they

31
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:48,369
were using and like the microcontroller

32
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:50,679
family the stm32 family and it seemed

33
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:52,509
like a good place to start with getting

34
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:53,799
maple mini which they recommended or at

35
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:58,899
least they said they started developing

36
00:01:53,799 --> 00:02:01,689
on so I had an idea for for what I could

37
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:03,999
do for DEFCON but what would it actually

38
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:06,758
be and that's when I started to think

39
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:08,049
about what would complement bender the

40
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,899
the badge is based around this

41
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,970
personality and how could I complement

42
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,830
that but also I take advantage of some

43
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,510
of the microcontroller capabilities and

44
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,250
first thing I thought about was bender

45
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,100
is he likes partying so he probably Kiev

46
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,080
con he likes music he likes drinking and

47
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,019
he likes smoking cigars and that cigar

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,360
stood out to me seems simple enough and

49
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,110
then the music aspect I like going to

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,110
like I

51
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,240
I love the all the buzz around Def Con

52
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,770
there's so much music and activity and I

53
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,030
kind of a way to visualize that and I

54
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,910
wanted to do something reactive for a

55
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,230
while to audio that was going on at Def

56
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,030
Con so I thought this would be a perfect

57
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,060
opportunity to do a live spectrum

58
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:49,750
analyzer going from twenty to twenty K

59
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,610
Hertz but how could I do it

60
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,040
and that's when I kind of broke it up

61
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,930
into two main parts which is I need to

62
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,310
make sure I could get the audio into the

63
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,010
board and I needed to make sure I had a

64
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,230
way to quickly process it so my first

65
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,359
proof of concept was making sure the

66
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,130
preamp worked I mean I can't really

67
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,860
start analyzing anything until I have

68
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,359
the audio coming in so I got that up and

69
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,250
running just a simple preamp for the

70
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,940
microphone so I could adjust the audio

71
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:18,220
to voltage levels that would be a bit

72
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,400
more resolution than just like one bolt

73
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:24,250
or whatever is giving me the next was to

74
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,340
write an FFT fast Fourier transform

75
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:30,670
which is how I you kind of go from the

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:35,320
audio spectrum to more of a frequency

77
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:37,780
spectrum and for that I had to I had two

78
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,060
ideas my preferable idea would be to

79
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,549
have it implemented in software and I

80
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,250
kind of got lucky with this one where SD

81
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:48,820
micro doll ready written their own FFT

82
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,320
library for the stm32 so I could take

83
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,090
advantage of that and that was really

84
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,880
nice because I did not want to jump to

85
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,530
the assembly for that process but I did

86
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,329
have a back-up plan which was to do this

87
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,489
all with a chip I was like a five dollar

88
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,170
of graphic equaliser chip what clay

89
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:03,670
didn't have to jump to that but the

90
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,350
importance was I had to have this proof

91
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,089
of concept because if I was gonna use

92
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,350
that chip then it was gonna change how

93
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,790
my board is gonna be laid out before I

94
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,410
send it out to fab the next question it

95
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,298
kind of brought up was what's the size

96
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:19,450
of this what should this size of this

97
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:21,459
board be and the best image I could find

98
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,830
at that time was this image of a couple

99
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,729
prototypes of the badge so what I did

100
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:30,969
was think about how I would size this up

101
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:32,950
properly and this arbitrary thing how

102
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,510
big is it but if you kind of take a look

103
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,000
at it you can notice that screen up top

104
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,650
is a pretty standard size and I had a

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,660
few laying on my desk so I measured what

106
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,789
the dimensions were and then I distorted

107
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,380
the image in Photoshop so that I had

108
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,050
like clean horizontal and vertical lines

109
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,450
on it and from there I was able to have

110
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,950
a pretty good guess of what the size of

111
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,170
this badge was gonna be so that I could

112
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,060
design the board for it with all that

113
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:58,510
set I sent out the board for fabrication

114
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:01,390
got it back and build a couple up had to

115
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:04,270
do a little bit debugging but more or

116
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:07,330
less had it ready to go the night before

117
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:10,080
Def Con as everything happens you kind

118
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:13,930
of prolong it until the last minute and

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,210
then you don't sleep before Def Con but

120
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,730
it turned out really cool I'm gonna try

121
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:31,570
to play this see if I can use the mic a

122
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:31,880
little bit but this is and then more the

123
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:39,670
audio

124
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,670
[Music]

125
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm only holding out because the audio

126
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:51,370
like the singing yeah you can kind of

127
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,960
see it a bit more there so from all of

128
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,940
that I kind of boiled it down to find

129
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,020
out there's a method behind this madness

130
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,940
and there's a process that I could

131
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,639
follow if I want to do this again which

132
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,469
I think I decided to do it again but

133
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,610
this mess this nessa

134
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:10,740
method method this method came down to

135
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:13,750
four easy steps one inspiration so I

136
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,100
love the time before at Def Con and

137
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,990
before other conferences where people

138
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,820
are getting so hyped with making stuff

139
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,110
and they're posting their stuff to

140
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,849
Twitter and it's kind of like everything

141
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,690
is coming together and just feeding off

142
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:27,970
of that energy because that gets I want

143
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:31,479
to I want to live in that buzz and

144
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:34,660
that's like my most inspired time so for

145
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:36,400
this for this part of my method I like

146
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,229
to take to Twitter and start to see what

147
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,388
other people are doing and find projects

148
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:42,070
that I can contribute to something where

149
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:46,240
I can compliment the work that's being

150
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:48,370
done and complement the work that other

151
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,830
people have put so much of their year

152
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,660
into and not take away from that and

153
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:58,090
like the two weeks that I'm gonna put

154
00:06:52,660 --> 00:07:01,660
work towards it but it's often hard to

155
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:05,080
figure out what to do so that comes to

156
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:07,840
ideation and this part tends to take the

157
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,180
longest for me is thinking about all

158
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,638
right so I this project seems really

159
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,889
cool and for the bender this is like

160
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,180
understanding the personality of the

161
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:17,950
badge or like the person you bought the

162
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,310
personality behind the badge the bender

163
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:23,680
character and what might be natural for

164
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,960
him or as I'll give an example or as

165
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,720
I'll show later on talking about the Ox

166
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,570
Fox complimenting what is the theme of

167
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:36,910
the badge that's kind of being presented

168
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:39,550
I want my I want my creation to to have

169
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,789
its own to have its own personality as

170
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,320
well next is proof of concept you have

171
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,060
to kind of break down everything that

172
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,450
you're doing into the most important

173
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,230
parts that are required to have this

174
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,229
thing work

175
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:56,440
and to be real so for the bender badge

176
00:07:53,230 --> 00:08:00,910
it was making sure I could have the

177
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,590
preamp that piped audio into into the

178
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,770
microcontroller and then also having the

179
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,570
FFT working if all I had was that and I

180
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,210
could quickly and I had a board that was

181
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,650
prototype for it and I was able to do it

182
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,539
then I was fine like if I couldn't get

183
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,789
the hardware done in time I at least had

184
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,910
that that working and that was all

185
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,960
that's needed and lastly is development

186
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:24,490
and that's kind of where you filled in

187
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,080
these details and you don't have to once

188
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,550
you have those core parts working you

189
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,030
can kind of just smooth it out and the

190
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,740
more you get done great but you have the

191
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,939
basics there already so you can at least

192
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,460
show it off you're not just talking

193
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,110
about oh yeah I wanted to do this now

194
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,669
it's like I did it and now I'm just

195
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,590
making it a little bit better each time

196
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:45,160
I have every hour I have more to spend

197
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:47,290
on it so fast forward to DEFCON 25 my

198
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,569
original plan was to hack on the bender

199
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,490
badge again but after watching a year of

200
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,590
the ANA explore guys work on this

201
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,300
project I felt like I'd be doing this

202
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,250
service if I was to rewrite my own

203
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,380
firmware for it and I didn't have time

204
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,830
to go through and decompile their

205
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:05,980
firmware and try to add to it so I had a

206
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:09,540
change sights to something else that's

207
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:14,250
when I saw this tweet from Joe Fitz and

208
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,250
I was like oh that seems like fun

209
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,980
and the only problem was this was eight

210
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:23,230
days before DEFCON so I had my work cut

211
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,980
out for me but I was pretty excited and

212
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:30,100
I was really happy that I noticed this

213
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,720
which is an NR 52 microcontroller on

214
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,340
there which I had bought the dev board

215
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,850
for when I originally planned on hacking

216
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,880
on the DEFCON 25 vendor badge so I was

217
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,830
like dev board check and then I noticed

218
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,470
something else there looks to be two

219
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,870
GPIO or it looks to be two sets of like

220
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,660
GPIO s which I would suspect her for a

221
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,860
joystick and you can't probably see it

222
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,209
from your seat but if you look closely

223
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,310
at this picture you can notice in the

224
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,550
top left of those two Pat of those two

225
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,709
sets of pads it looks like that top left

226
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,000
pad is a ground pad so I was like all

227
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,340
right so there's probably internal pull

228
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,640
ups for these and the rest I'm guessing

229
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,910
or

230
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,709
or at least I'm hoping and that was good

231
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,430
enough for me and it's like 10 GPIO s

232
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:15,609
I've got the dev board for the NR 52 now

233
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,989
what should I do and I will omit it took

234
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,029
me a little while to realize what the

235
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:22,690
theme of the badge was it wasn't until a

236
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:24,880
friend of mine kind of pointed out that

237
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:28,360
it's a group of hackers from Oregon and

238
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,810
it's the 503 Trail that I put together

239
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:36,610
that it must be an Oregon Trail themed

240
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:38,920
badge but that was also when I realized

241
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:43,050
it's a wagon and the Oregon Trail has an

242
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:45,250
ox where the hell is the ox and I

243
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:49,089
figured well I'll add an ox to it

244
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,740
because it needs one the only problem is

245
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:53,980
how are you gonna attach an ox with cuz

246
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,510
it requires that whatever the attachment

247
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,680
to attach it at the cart so like well I

248
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,050
guess I have to do to the cart as well

249
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,040
or at least the base of the cart and

250
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,099
with the base of the cart

251
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,050
what uh what am I gonna put in all that

252
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,260
open space there's this long horizontal

253
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:10,420
space so that kind of made sense to me

254
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,589
as an area for a keyboard I don't know I

255
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,719
don't know if you're seeing a theme but

256
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:16,660
I'd like to put audio stuff in the hacks

257
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,610
that I do so I saw this long horizontal

258
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,649
space and it seemed like the perfect

259
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,600
space for an eighth or like a full

260
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,550
octave eighth key keyboard especially if

261
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,010
I have ten GPIOs available to me I need

262
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:31,000
one for the audio and I need ten I need

263
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:32,740
8 to control the keys now the question

264
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,510
was if I'm gonna make something that

265
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,940
goes on top of this badge what's the

266
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,890
size of it so here I was able to capture

267
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,560
or at least I documented in my own

268
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,800
internal files what I did for measuring

269
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,569
and it's a little cut off at the bottom

270
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,399
for measuring the badge so I took that

271
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,990
one image by Joe and then I started to

272
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,790
stored it and made sure everything kind

273
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,339
of like lined up on the outside so if

274
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,469
you notice that top part are like the

275
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,940
two most topmost parts are just line up

276
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,769
horizontally in the bottom most parts

277
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:04,170
line up horizontally and then vertically

278
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:08,019
on the sides as I expand it I then

279
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:13,839
looked at the at the headers on the side

280
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:16,180
these top and if you know I'm guessing

281
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,780
it's typical header spacing so tenth of

282
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,359
an inch

283
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:21,819
and I was able to scale that image based

284
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,580
on that and I came across the dimensions

285
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,690
for it to be around three by four I was

286
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,280
like you know that's good enough to

287
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:31,240
guess it's probably three inches by four

288
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,829
inches so I round it up to that and that

289
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,320
was it I had the size of the badge and I

290
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,780
knew I had an idea for how things would

291
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,790
line up how I'd be able to have

292
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:43,300
something that would hook into all of

293
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:49,620
those different parts expecially or and

294
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:52,599
to the vias to get VCC and ground and

295
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,150
that was good enough to move forward so

296
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,280
as I said breaking it down into the kind

297
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,870
of proof of concept phase and there was

298
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,140
a few things I needed to figure out here

299
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,460
one idea to do a quick amplifier circuit

300
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,060
but - I need to make sure I could

301
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:09,240
generate a sine wave with that so after

302
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:13,000
a little bit of work I was able to get a

303
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,390
sine wave out of the dev board that I

304
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,500
was working with the NRF 52 dev board

305
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:22,840
and the only problem was Here I am you

306
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,190
can't see this I just noticed that all

307
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,640
of my dates that I've been trying to

308
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:32,710
point out aren't actually visible I'm

309
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:34,689
sorry about that so this the date on

310
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,030
this was then four days before Def Con

311
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,790
so I'd already killed half of my time

312
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:41,050
but I know things were looking up I had

313
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,300
a proof of concept for the saw for the

314
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,900
firmware and I had a proof of concept

315
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:49,329
for the hardware the only question was

316
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,069
how was I gonna route it out to be a

317
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,390
knock shape because what's the point of

318
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,790
doing this hack if it doesn't actually

319
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,430
look like an ox to add on to this badge

320
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,439
and it just I mean I guess there was a

321
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,839
point to it but I want to go for that

322
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,070
coolness looking like an ox addon factor

323
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,560
so I decided to find or I looked around

324
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:11,020
our shop at work and we had this tiny

325
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,969
CNC we have an industrial one - but I

326
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,840
went for the tiny CNC it seemed a little

327
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:22,330
less daunting and I attempted to cut out

328
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:24,220
the Ox shape good news it worked so I

329
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:27,160
had the prototype roof of concept for

330
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:30,060
cutting out the ox and that was it I had

331
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,560
my three had my three parts of the

332
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,170
concept ready to go I could generate

333
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,020
sine waves I can use the my audio

334
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:39,599
amplifier worked and now I was able to

335
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:42,480
use the CNC so with that going forward I

336
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,920
set out to make my boards this was the

337
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,870
night of that I was at this stage so

338
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,079
with that in mind I decided eight would

339
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,440
probably be a good number of bad is to

340
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,290
take to Def Con and I started out by

341
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,820
taking a two sided blank PCB or like a

342
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,130
copper to copper on both sides I

343
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,090
spray-paint at both sides I've kind of

344
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,860
been lucky that I've been doing this

345
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,540
sort of prototyping for the past year so

346
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,400
I was able to go through this kinda

347
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,520
quick which would otherwise not be

348
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,500
possible in a night I then lays it off

349
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,110
all the areas where I didn't where I

350
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,080
wanted to get etched away by the PCB

351
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,000
etchant and then I kind of have this

352
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,340
before and after where the bottom is

353
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,560
what it looks like after I dropped it in

354
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,930
the laser etching and then the top one

355
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,199
is after I dropped it into the PCB

356
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:34,620
etchant and then a visual of the back my

357
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,780
alignment wasn't the greatest I've had

358
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,240
better luck with doing two-sided boards

359
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:43,620
and just doing alignment but this was

360
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:46,020
not one of those good days and then now

361
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,470
it's like time to do the more industrial

362
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:53,640
CNC attempt unfortunately I broke my

363
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:56,040
small as a bit on the first go so all of

364
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,340
I was able to cut things out but all of

365
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,349
the button holes are like vias that I

366
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,240
had to do I had to do by hand and that

367
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,960
ended up adding a lot of time so another

368
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:10,020
night of not sleeping before Def Con but

369
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,390
I had the hardware and the software or

370
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,010
the firmware could then be done at Def

371
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,930
Con the important part was the hardware

372
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:19,290
the hardware was in hand

373
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:21,510
I had the parts digi-key came through by

374
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,240
delivering their awesome overnight

375
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,850
shipping and I was ready to head off to

376
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,320
Def Con where a buddy of mine started to

377
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:31,560
help me write some more the firmware

378
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,230
build it out I want to give a big shout

379
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,520
out to my friend Ben without his help I

380
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,370
probably wouldn't have gotten anywhere

381
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,860
close to where I did before or by the

382
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,120
time of Def Con because as I was hacking

383
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,230
away the firmware he was finding a way

384
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,230
to

385
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,880
the the he was dumping what was on the

386
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,120
badger already reversing it so he could

387
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,560
get the understand what GPAs were being

388
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,310
used and then I could use that

389
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,260
information for my controls he had a

390
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,849
hell of a time with it only to learn

391
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:03,770
that it was in our DNA do we know sketch

392
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,770
that was uploaded to github later on

393
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:11,700
damn boot loaders so I I also was pretty

394
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,650
excited because when I all of this was

395
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,990
happening without any with just like

396
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:19,470
okay this is fun it'll probably be cool

397
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,540
to show off but lo and behold DC 503

398
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:25,079
came through and offered a badge hacking

399
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:28,379
competition like oh well I've already

400
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,760
put some time into this but it doesn't

401
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,010
really it doesn't really work if you

402
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,050
don't get there on time so the party

403
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,660
started at well they're doing the the

404
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:40,950
judging at 9:00 p.m. and then I saw that

405
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:44,460
we uh the tweet at 9:05 and said hold up

406
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:47,730
I'm on my way I got there after it was

407
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:50,430
over and my badge was shot early put

408
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,670
together it only still ran off the dev

409
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:56,070
board and it only played a single key

410
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:59,850
but it worked and it was enough to

411
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:02,010
impress Joe and he offered he said well

412
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,719
why don't you come out - besides PDX and

413
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,150
talk about it which then gave me another

414
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,290
two months to work on this if only I

415
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:13,170
would have spent two months working on

416
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:16,850
it but I did spend some time and I did I

417
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:22,770
did I did use that time to fabricate

418
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:26,820
some a nicer version of the Ox box so

419
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:29,490
this is the front and back of my little

420
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,740
add-on that I've created as you can see

421
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,740
the eight keys up top and then the

422
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,990
amplifier on the aux itself with a

423
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:42,150
speaker coming out of the wheel I guess

424
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:43,770
axle where the axle would be and I don't

425
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,330
know if you guys saw me yesterday but I

426
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:48,150
was still working through some of the

427
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:50,010
challenges the pinout changed a little

428
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,480
bit so I had a quickly roll some new

429
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,150
firmware and then there were other

430
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,670
challenges like somehow disabling my

431
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,120
well I created some complication in my

432
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,820
display

433
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,439
it's not working now it might be

434
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:07,590
hardware I think it's hardware but I

435
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:10,290
have this beautiful ox now with the

436
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:27,959
badge and let's see if it's gonna work

437
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:29,820
if not I have a backup video it was a

438
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,530
challenging time but it all came through

439
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:36,450
and I'm up here and able to present it

440
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:38,190
now it had some cool visuals to go with

441
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,370
it maybe I'll get them working by the

442
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,559
time this is over I don't know but I had

443
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,209
cool letters that would pop up as you

444
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,710
press the buttons but as my display is

445
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,690
not working and I've run into a lot of

446
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,309
power issues I think I broke it when I

447
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,640
was trying to solve some my power issues

448
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:56,550
the amplifier and the amplifier is a

449
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,980
little under watt and I don't even know

450
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:02,809
the display but it once I combine the

451
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:05,700
two it quickly drained a lot of battery

452
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:06,620
but I'm pretty excited for where this

453
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,850
came

454
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,559
obviously I have a million other ideas

455
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,570
for how this could be improved like I

456
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,460
would I think at Def Con I want to do

457
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,470
something where you could collaborate

458
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,080
via Bluetooth and people could play

459
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:22,160
different different pitches at the same

460
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:27,809
time and kind of have multi keyboard

461
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:31,230
input but as with most things time just

462
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:35,250
escapes me so thank you all for

463
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:37,200
listening to my journey as I like to get

464
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,100
inspired and kind of understand how

465
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,460
these things work and how I can

466
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:44,428
contribute to fun projects and maybe get

467
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:46,559
some stuff for free out of it I think

468
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:48,570
yeah the need for getting for trading

469
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,270
and finding ways to get free stuff is

470
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:53,820
always there but yeah thanks for coming

471
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:56,460
out if you I'm gonna publish I'll make

472
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,830
all my stuff open-source and I'll show

473
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,300
some of the of postable files and the

474
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,710
firmware once it's cleaned up and

475
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,230
perfected a little bit more well

476
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,470
shouldn't say perfected but improved a

477
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,000
little bit more

478
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,980
feel free to reach out if you have

479
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,990
questions or if you want to make one of

480
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:14,350
your own or figure out how to get it

481
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:19,250
work if you get one but thanks

482
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,250
[Applause]

483
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,470
you
