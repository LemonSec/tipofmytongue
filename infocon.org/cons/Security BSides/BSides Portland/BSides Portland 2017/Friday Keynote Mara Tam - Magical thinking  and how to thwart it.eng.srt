1
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:25,230
so I am Mara I live and work around here

2
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:31,710
this is becoming increasingly accurate

3
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:35,940
and not funny um if if you wonder how

4
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:39,060
about it is it's it's bad Tech policy is

5
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,099
currently very lonely and fraught place

6
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,440
we kind of went from a high watermark

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,300
under the last administration where you

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,059
know I I had friends from Redmond out

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,220
there all the time and you know there

10
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,560
were there were always people around and

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,239
now it's just kind of like crickets in

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,250
between technical advisory meetings at

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,390
the Department of Commerce if people

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,100
even come to those so I work in an

15
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,320
advisory capacity I do not work for

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,939
these agencies I do not represent their

17
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,350
views but these are some of the agencies

18
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,860
that I have acted as a private-sector

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,960
advisor for usually for the intersection

20
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,030
of policy and what that actually means

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,710
in technology terms like if you make

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,259
this policy what does that actually mean

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,130
for the technology or what does this

24
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:25,020
technology mean for this policy question

25
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,609
and more or less what we're what we're

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,530
going to do is I'm going to exploit my

27
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:30,210
speaker privileges and give a

28
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,810
curmudgeonly intro rant about things

29
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,609
that I hate about policy talks work a

30
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,749
little bit through why we can't have

31
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:40,350
nice things

32
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:42,030
which substantially hey we substantially

33
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,079
was covered by both my Gossman and

34
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,799
Senator Wyden and then a few examples of

35
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,479
magical thinking in the wild and

36
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,030
adventures in thwarting which are sort

37
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,020
of woven throughout but you know I feel

38
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,299
like it's important to kind of work at a

39
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,429
raft of things that we can do to

40
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,590
actually make things better instead of

41
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:05,939
just you know getting up on stage like

42
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,209
this and shouting about how broken

43
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:12,230
everything is so instead of prior art

44
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:15,980
we've got a literature review and

45
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:20,399
magical thinking came out of the idea of

46
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:23,549
sort of a bestiary and a bestiary is a

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,550
medieval compendium the documents sort

48
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,440
of animals

49
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,440
in the natural world and you know prior

50
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,840
to the advent of of proper by biology

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,790
and and and proper biological sciences

52
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,730
these often were you know effectively

53
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,530
the equivalent of having third hand

54
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,390
accounts of blind men who once felt an

55
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:45,220
elephant and trying to describe an

56
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:47,230
elephant based on that so that in the

57
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,770
20th century morphed into these sort of

58
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:53,440
cheeky political bestiaries

59
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:56,260
which inspired the work on the left I

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:01,000
think that was the work on the right is

61
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:03,100
1979 the work on the left is 1981 but

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,800
the work on the left is from the CIA's

63
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,210
internal journal for intelligence

64
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,660
professionals called studies and

65
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:13,590
intelligence and the strange anteater

66
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:18,880
Hydra thing you're looking at is

67
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:21,070
apparently multidisciplinary analysis so

68
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,480
anyway unclassified articles from

69
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,650
studies and intelligence are published

70
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,859
quarterly by by CIA and have been for

71
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:32,400
about 15 years I highly recommend their

72
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:36,300
book reviews they're really really good

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:40,140
so in addition to this inspiration

74
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,790
substantially this work was inspired by

75
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,708
by some talks that Sergei brought us has

76
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,989
given over the years this one in

77
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,320
particular which is offense and defense

78
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,370
notes on the shape of the beast

79
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,980
and that is one of my favorite slides

80
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,110
that he that he put up which was about

81
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,790
our all bugs shallow and the answer is

82
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,840
well of course they're not how big is

83
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:04,600
your ocean so Sergei has worked for a

84
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,950
really long time and or is one of the

85
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,470
friendly neighbors that has worked for a

86
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,420
really long time on articulating you

87
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,390
know what is this hacking stuff anyway

88
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:16,659
we've got this universe of we've we've

89
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,339
got the intended universe that we design

90
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,600
and then we've got everything that we

91
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,979
can do within that universe and Sergei

92
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,860
just has a more eloquent and more

93
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:30,040
accurate way of conveying the realities

94
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,610
of Investigation of computing systems

95
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:37,300
than I think most others do and then we

96
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,260
have not last year two years ago my

97
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,120
Kauffman stood up here

98
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:44,349
and told you that your ideas are

99
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,360
worthless and it's interesting because

100
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,730
Mike was Mike really was talking about

101
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,520
the way that we develop things in the

102
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:54,210
way that we value ideas and you know

103
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,299
these two points that he made really

104
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,710
really stuck out to me so ideas have

105
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,300
value in proportion to how much they are

106
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,070
shared and he was talking about patent

107
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,950
law and whether or not you know what

108
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,330
what is the value in open-source but I

109
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:11,110
heard something a little bit different

110
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:14,320
and related to what Senator Wyden had to

111
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,090
say last year and so Mike's fundamental

112
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,530
point of your ideas are worthless until

113
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,599
you share them with the world

114
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,659
well if you're looking for high-impact

115
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,610
places to share ideas you really can't

116
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,050
get much more high impact than DC and

117
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:33,580
looking at senator Wyden's talk which

118
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,320
was about a a large variety of species

119
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,940
of magical thinking that go on in

120
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,790
Washington about the relationship

121
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,620
between security and privacy it kind of

122
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,210
occurred to me that those two talks were

123
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:48,880
actually a lot more related than maybe

124
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:50,979
they might seem and in fact like even

125
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,920
even the view of the world that Senator

126
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,290
Wyden put forward he he did say in

127
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,940
closing his talk that you know he's a

128
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:01,690
member of the intelligence community and

129
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:04,750
he is also an advocate for preserving

130
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:08,730
strong encryption at all costs and these

131
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:12,010
are not mutually exclusive or or or

132
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,210
paradoxical conditions you know but he

133
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:17,020
did say that the world is a dangerous

134
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,460
place but on the flip side you know the

135
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,990
world can be a dangerous place and we

136
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,260
can be empathetic to the needs of law

137
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,820
enforcement but are we actually serving

138
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,740
their needs and I think that was his

139
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,440
question you know does a back door even

140
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,030
help the people who are fighting to make

141
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,250
the world safe and I think he was coming

142
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:38,500
down on know which is more or less where

143
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:40,660
I do and just as an aside even even law

144
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,230
enforcement officers will very readily

145
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:48,760
say and did say in a I think this is a

146
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:50,180
2015 study by the National Institute of

147
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,210
justice

148
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,130
on the high price on the high priority

149
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,469
information technology needs of law

150
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,870
enforcement and you would think that

151
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,400
when law enforcement would be asked to

152
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,240
describe what their technology needs are

153
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,500
they would say well we want more toys

154
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,889
but that actually wasn't what they said

155
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,860
they they cited technical skills

156
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:15,590
training and skilled management as well

157
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,169
as sound policy for using the tool the

158
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,299
tools they already had as the primary

159
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:25,789
deficiencies in that in that ecosystem

160
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:27,470
not we need new toys so I think there's

161
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:30,080
more common ground there than usually we

162
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:35,090
give it credit for but we'll get back to

163
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,219
that lastly I have to say how far did me

164
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,609
an epic solid with the series of talks

165
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,800
that he gave and in thinking about and

166
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,710
in in sort of this universe of magical

167
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,780
thinking one of one of my biggest pet

168
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,280
peeves is that you get a policy problem

169
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,789
and the first thing somebody wants to do

170
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:57,109
is throw an engineer at it and however

171
00:07:52,789 --> 00:08:00,979
gave this talk up here at blackhat Asia

172
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:04,010
on why we aren't building a defendable

173
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:07,599
Internet and his the preceding talk was

174
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:11,419
how to build a defendable internet and

175
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,130
Alvers point was this offensive problems

176
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,740
are technical problems defensive

177
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,979
problems are political problems and in

178
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:21,080
opening his talk at blackhat this year

179
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:22,669
he he basically said I gave the easy

180
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,430
talk first because the technical

181
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,049
problems actually aren't that hard why

182
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,979
we're not doing them and why we're not

183
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:35,599
implementing them that's the hard part

184
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:39,500
so another like little bit on things I

185
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,719
hate about policy talks in short policy

186
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,640
hobbyists governance is actually a

187
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:47,779
profession it's it's not a thing that

188
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,230
you just sort of drop into and I don't

189
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:52,339
know how many just show of hands how

190
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,529
many people think they know how the

191
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,529
federal government more or less works

192
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:10,860
and I've got like one maybe okay so in

193
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,959
this in this room this room is typical

194
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,000
of most rooms in that the workings of

195
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,370
the federal government are pretty opaque

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,650
and mysterious it's kind of it's black

197
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,950
box with a lot of documentation if that

198
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:25,199
makes any sense but it is actually a

199
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,710
profession and if I were to try to

200
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,380
describe to you what what governance is

201
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:34,290
is a profession its public service but

202
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,850
that comes in several flavors right and

203
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,620
I think when we get angry about

204
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,900
politicians and about government not

205
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,020
working we really are getting angry at

206
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:45,030
politicians and the political class is

207
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,160
only part of what makes up the

208
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:50,189
government they're sort of the crunchy

209
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,520
outer shell and interface with the

210
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:56,730
populace but then there's this massive

211
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,530
professional class and these are people

212
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,690
who go through very rigorous hiring tech

213
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:03,900
you know hiring regimes and actually

214
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:06,270
know their stuff really really well in

215
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,250
an organization the size of a federal

216
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,500
government it can take seven or eight

217
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:14,130
years just to get good at the job you're

218
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:17,880
in because your universe is vast and

219
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:19,650
complicated and illogical and fraught

220
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,820
and you hate your life and you don't get

221
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:26,160
paid very much but you do it anyway

222
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:29,010
because public service another thing

223
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,300
that I will note about policy talks in

224
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:34,819
general is that we are prone to

225
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:37,709
oversimplifying I can't count how many

226
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,500
introduction to CFAA or introduction to

227
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:44,910
DMCA talks I've seen on black hat or DEF

228
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,890
CON schedules over the years I think at

229
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,290
this point we are intelligent enough as

230
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,880
a community to move beyond 101 I think

231
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,579
you know even if we don't know how the

232
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,350
federal government works we understand

233
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,000
policy issues well enough that we should

234
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,960
be delving into them a little bit more

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,290
deeply than awareness-raising I think we

236
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,660
are adequately aware at this point and

237
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,650
I'm not sure the utility of further

238
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,050
doomsaying

239
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,910
I you know

240
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,829
are stuck with the fact that governance

241
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,079
is a thing we have social contract it

242
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,580
might be a broken social contract and it

243
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,690
might be in a radical state of flux

244
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:22,490
right now but that you know repeating

245
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:27,589
that ad nauseam doesn't actually solve

246
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:30,380
the problem so as an example of the sort

247
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:33,019
of hobbyist oversimplification problem

248
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,939
and also of how government works how

249
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:41,029
many of you have seen or filled out

250
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:43,550
something like this a a webform a call

251
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:47,800
to action of some kind that says email

252
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:50,149
your representative something like that

253
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,479
okay so that's at least half the room

254
00:11:50,149 --> 00:12:02,540
how many of you think that that does

255
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:04,670
something okay so I live and work around

256
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:08,589
DC I'm friends with a lot of staffers on

257
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:11,599
the hill one of them told me point blank

258
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,760
and then this is this is relatively well

259
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,410
known in DC but one of them mentioned to

260
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,000
me that you know his perpetual

261
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:22,819
frustration was that people think that

262
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,860
this counts as interacting with your

263
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,709
representative and there's actually a

264
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:30,170
hierarchy of how this works

265
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:33,439
if you call your representative like on

266
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:35,390
the telephone that does a million times

267
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,459
more for the issue that you care about

268
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,069
than filling out one of these web forms

269
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:42,020
and if you really really really want to

270
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,200
have high impact you write them a letter

271
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,180
you you actually write them and write

272
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,490
them a letter print it out put it in an

273
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:53,149
envelope send it to them email their

274
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:58,570
staff directly but this this is actually

275
00:12:53,149 --> 00:13:01,730
worse than useless this this counts as

276
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:05,630
in if you're a staffer and you get piles

277
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,670
of this this is this sort of mass action

278
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,300
stuff doesn't register to them because

279
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,699
it's not telling them what you think

280
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:16,010
it's giving you an opportunity to proxy

281
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:18,290
somebody else and if you call them and

282
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,230
if you say hi senator I have concerns

283
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,510
about this issue

284
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,010
and I have to say having looked at it I

285
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,880
really agree with the position that the

286
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:34,830
e FF has developed that does something

287
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:39,240
but that no anyway I will I will I will

288
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:41,040
I will leave that there so um anyway the

289
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,280
next time you feel like doing a little

290
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,810
bit of activist of activist work phones

291
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:51,420
phones are not dead

292
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:54,449
there they work really well so moving on

293
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,969
to magical thinking in the wild I used

294
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,320
to try to enumerate these and I decided

295
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,760
that instead of having a schedule this

296
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,000
time I would just put up a picture of

297
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,310
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza and that is

298
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,700
Don Quixote racing off to joust

299
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:14,640
windmills which you can see a little bit

300
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:17,700
better there so he yes so one of the

301
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,480
first one of the first bits of magical

302
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:24,150
thinking that I encounter in DC is going

303
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,340
dark and just to race through this

304
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,569
example this is the idea that even

305
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,940
though we are in the most connected

306
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,950
state we have ever been in somehow we

307
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,510
are slipping farther and farther out of

308
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,980
the view of law enforcement and the

309
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,660
people who try to handle the dangerous

310
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:45,150
world that Senator Wyden talked to you

311
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:46,680
about last year so this is one of my

312
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,060
least favorite species of magical

313
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,900
thinking because it results in some of

314
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,819
the most idiotic policy proposals and in

315
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,290
fact we all like most of the people in

316
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,790
this room should be aware that you know

317
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,520
even if you do all of the things that

318
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,870
keep FBI directors up at night even if

319
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,430
you use signal even if you use

320
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,250
end-to-end encryption even if you do

321
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:10,050
everything that you have ever read in

322
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:13,020
any medium post by the croc I you know

323
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:15,719
you you are still never going to be

324
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,699
adequately dark to be out of you I so

325
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,420
that's one of my least favorite ones on

326
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,910
the flipside if anybody remembers the

327
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,569
shadow brokers I think they're still

328
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:29,189
around on the flip side and other

329
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,420
species of magical thinking you get in

330
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,870
the other direction

331
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,880
is that government shouldn't have

332
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,350
hacking tools because if someone

333
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,780
develops a hacking tool therefore

334
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,910
everyone will have that hacking tool and

335
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,100
this has been a bit of a fraught one

336
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,630
because you know basically what we've

337
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,480
seen with the shadow brokers is you have

338
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,700
a nation state that stole fully formed

339
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,620
and functional tooling from our

340
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,690
intelligence community and instead of

341
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,160
using that as espionage and and keeping

342
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,990
that to themselves they started dumping

343
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,439
it on the internet which is new and

344
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:05,950
different that is not the way espionage

345
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:09,730
used to work and in fact that's not

346
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:12,400
espionage that's information ops but

347
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,730
this is a difficult one because and I

348
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,949
encountered this in think tanks a lot is

349
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:20,980
the assumption that if we have developed

350
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,450
a capability surely somebody else has

351
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,270
that capability as well and they have

352
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,550
used exactly the same technical role a

353
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,240
technical route to achieve that

354
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,699
capability

355
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,560
and modern exploitation doesn't work

356
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,230
like that modern exploitation is

357
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,359
composite it's chained it is highly

358
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,450
contextual and it is really really

359
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,890
difficult to do to the standard that

360
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:46,450
we've seen in these in these stumps but

361
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,620
another thing that we know is like we've

362
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:52,090
identified nation-state actors from a

363
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,640
number of nation-states now there is

364
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:57,520
there is data it is not high quality

365
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,439
data but there is data to suggest that

366
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,720
just because you are a nation-state

367
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,720
doesn't mean that all nation-states hack

368
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,450
the same we have different priorities we

369
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,589
use different methodologies like

370
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:12,069
nation-states hack differently from one

371
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:15,459
another and so the idea that you know

372
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,839
withholding a vulnerability or you know

373
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,880
the idea that withholding one

374
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:23,919
vulnerability from the vendor that is

375
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,780
affected is inevitably going to result

376
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,110
in the use of that vulnerability by a

377
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,450
different nation-state that's a false

378
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:34,510
equivalence that I run into more often

379
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:38,980
than I would like and that is resulting

380
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:43,720
in equally idiotic policy measures and

381
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:45,940
these are just so this ended up being

382
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,860
a really fun conversation in Heidelberg

383
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,780
earlier this year because we had a lot

384
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:56,020
of information sharing people around and

385
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:57,600
again there's there's this idea that for

386
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,950
some reason the technology is

387
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,129
disproportionately implicated in the

388
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,929
proliferation of terrorist activities

389
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,490
and that if only they didn't have the

390
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:10,809
crypto they wouldn't be able to do the

391
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:14,230
terror I like that sounds insane and it

392
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:15,789
is but this was fun in Heidelberg

393
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,159
because we had folks around that

394
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:20,169
actually do information sharing and the

395
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,429
great part is that if you talk to actual

396
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:23,860
practitioners in the counterterrorism

397
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:25,990
community they really care about

398
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,070
information sharing a lot more than they

399
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,659
care about breaking encryption and it's

400
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,549
funny because whether you're in

401
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:35,320
information security or counterterrorism

402
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:37,720
information sharing is just a nightmare

403
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,460
there's no budget for it everybody hates

404
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,539
you when you try to do it nobody trusts

405
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,650
you everybody just like it it's just bad

406
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:47,169
and that is one of the things that I

407
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,299
think we have to get better at so

408
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:51,309
information sharing is like the unsexy

409
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:55,139
unloved child that actually turns out to

410
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:57,970
be a really effective security tool and

411
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:03,130
it's a profoundly human problem that we

412
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:08,830
just don't have a good grip on yet so

413
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:13,500
that's all very depressing and and we're

414
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,500
going to change gears a little tiny bit

415
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,429
actually how many people here

416
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:25,178
participate in any kind of information

417
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:27,340
sharing program on yeah on behalf or on

418
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:32,799
behalf of or with your employer it's

419
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:38,260
about maybe a dozen and a half that's

420
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:43,389
better okay moving on to hideously

421
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:46,140
complex systems and why they are hard so

422
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:51,970
this is a ballistic missile submarine

423
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:53,860
and like many of our legacy systems sub

424
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,750
ballistic missile submarines are

425
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,149
hideously calm

426
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,730
they're expensive and if the tiniest

427
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:02,159
thing goes wrong they can kill you

428
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:06,630
although in this case it can also kill

429
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:09,780
me and everyone which is slightly

430
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,640
different from computing systems so the

431
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,850
discrete components of the Ness SVN can

432
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,159
function they can function perfectly to

433
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,020
their design specifications but if you

434
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,630
assemble them incorrectly can produce

435
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,309
catastrophic failures and if this sounds

436
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,429
familiar in the security sense it should

437
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:28,678
because you know for decades we have

438
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,900
approached this by trying to secure one

439
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,370
bit at a time or taking known secure

440
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,169
components and assembling them in

441
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:37,469
idiotic waves that produce insecure

442
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:41,190
systems and we know that that just

443
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:45,770
doesn't work and part of part of the

444
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:53,190
reason that this happens is structural

445
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:54,450
and I expect about half of you are going

446
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,299
to leave when I say this but I am gonna

447
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,490
talk a little bit about procurement and

448
00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:01,440
about procurement policies and in

449
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:05,760
structural structural incentives in

450
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,340
procurement anyway so these submarines

451
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,549
are designed to run for 30 plus years I

452
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,770
and you know you have your capital

453
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:15,210
expenditure you get your submarine it's

454
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:18,408
supposed to be good for at least three

455
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:20,490
decades you can extend their lives by

456
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:23,909
subjecting them to extensive engineering

457
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:25,080
overhauls and these take 30 to 40 months

458
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:28,440
in drydock

459
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,879
they take both crews assigned to the

460
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:37,820
boat it's really really pretty intense

461
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:41,159
but even if that intensity of activity

462
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,799
you know even that intensity of activity

463
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,480
produces what's called steady-state you

464
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:47,250
don't get something other than a

465
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,580
submarine at the end of 30 or 40 months

466
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:54,840
of overhaul you still have a submarine

467
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:56,610
at least you hope you do and and this

468
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,250
this qualifies as operations and

469
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:02,010
maintenance an O&M can get really

470
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,780
confusing sometimes in these complex

471
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,780
systems that are very long-lived

472
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,670
because when it's

473
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,760
system has a long life when it is

474
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:12,070
specified at inception if you have to

475
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,540
service that thing 40 years later the

476
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,480
standard technology that you may be

477
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,190
employing to replace the capability may

478
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,670
on in may have unintended consequences

479
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:25,720
of altering baseline capabilities or

480
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:27,760
introducing new functionality so that's

481
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,860
when onm gets a little bit confusing and

482
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,340
it can start to look like development

483
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:37,000
modernization and enhancement so this is

484
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,610
just a sort of a quick breakdown of what

485
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,140
the two things are and development

486
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,290
modernization and enhancement is

487
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,030
basically capital expenditure so that's

488
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,159
what you need when you need to improve

489
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,780
capability or performance you need to

490
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,330
meet a regulatory or a compliance

491
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,050
standard or you just need to buy new

492
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,730
stuff and I think recently on Twitter

493
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:59,919
Alex Thomas had put together what I

494
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,140
think he called like the worst middle

495
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:08,020
management tweet thread in in history

496
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:10,990
and was trying to figure out if he if he

497
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:15,220
was trying to figure out the accounting

498
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,630
for acquisition of ninjas and I pointed

499
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,310
out to him that if he was replacing

500
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,840
ninjas it would be operations in

501
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,340
maintenance but if he was introducing

502
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:27,280
ninjas into his system then that would

503
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:33,939
definitely be a capital expenditure so

504
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:35,410
dammy accounts for so DME in federal IT

505
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:40,180
spending which is where you can get

506
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:45,670
really like quite good data on this you

507
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:50,320
can so okay this is fiscal year 2016 on

508
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:52,510
non provisioned eme services and DME

509
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,290
services are for projects and activities

510
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:58,450
that lead to new assets and systems or

511
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:02,470
projects and activities that change or

512
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:06,610
modify existing IT assets but the weird

513
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:09,220
split here is that orange bar at the top

514
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:10,629
those are non major investments and so

515
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,030
those are ones where you don't actually

516
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:16,300
have to submit a business justification

517
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:18,540
for why you need to do this which I find

518
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:22,930
a little bit strange

519
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:25,330
so this also is from fiscal year 16 and

520
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:27,460
this is actually way better than it has

521
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,990
been so this is the breakdown between

522
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,850
how much the federal government's IT

523
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:35,260
budget is split between capital

524
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:36,699
expenditures and duct tape duct tape a

525
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,440
good tug tape constitutes in the

526
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,660
overwhelming majority of the money that

527
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,630
we spend in IT and this is true if

528
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:48,490
you're in the private sector or the

529
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:51,220
public sector and if you are in charge

530
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:54,100
of security budget how many of you have

531
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,990
ever found it easier to actually replace

532
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,020
the capability rather than service it

533
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:03,220
and like hope that it actually still

534
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:08,379
works anyway that's sort of so

535
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:12,870
submarines um a slightly more I think a

536
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:15,670
more amusing example is Wang

537
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:21,129
how many people actually know know or

538
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:22,600
remember Wang Labs excellent okay

539
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:25,000
so this has become one of my favorite

540
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,080
procurement stories and you should

541
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,920
probably ignore the fact that I have

542
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,030
favorite procurement stories

543
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,910
specifically I really want to talk about

544
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:38,410
Wang as as the story of Wang unfolded

545
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:41,140
here and here is here being this hideous

546
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:43,270
and nondescript federal IT building that

547
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:47,770
is actually the u.s. Department of State

548
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:49,600
in Foggy Bottom and that is also an

549
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:51,190
archival photograph which is

550
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,959
contemporaneous with our story which

551
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:58,150
take play takes place between sort of

552
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:00,340
the 80s and the early wild 90s wine labs

553
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:02,980
actually goes obviously goes back a lot

554
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:07,360
longer than that but for the purposes of

555
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:11,440
this story 90 State Department scene so

556
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:15,639
in August of 1990 the State Department

557
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,980
leadership had figured out that they

558
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,370
really needed to start investing in

559
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:25,600
their IT infrastructure with with with

560
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:28,590
passion and purpose and they manifested

561
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,299
that passion in purpose by awarding Wang

562
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:35,220
hording Wang laboratories a five

563
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:37,679
your 840 1.3 million dollar contract

564
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:45,700
which in today's money would be about

565
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:48,129
1.6 billion dollars and that that is a

566
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,649
bit strange for a company that was

567
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:52,658
literally circling chapter 11 at this

568
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:55,738
point had made its name making word

569
00:26:52,659 --> 00:27:01,509
processors and was clearly on the outs

570
00:26:55,739 --> 00:27:03,279
so you know despite despite the fact

571
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:04,779
that you know they'd been struggling for

572
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,749
years the State Department ordered them

573
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:10,239
this contract but it's you know I don't

574
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:11,830
want to disparage wine too much it is it

575
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:14,350
should be noted that at one point Wang

576
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:16,359
competed like basically directly with

577
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,100
you at Packard at one point I think on

578
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:21,039
Wang was the fifth richest man in

579
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,178
America and they did this by making ma

580
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,009
no purpose

581
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:25,869
ma no purpose machines they did this by

582
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:29,859
building word processors that processed

583
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:31,779
words really good so everybody kind of

584
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:34,629
you know everybody kind of took the

585
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:37,269
State Department signal as a sign that

586
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:40,359
you know maybe Wang had another shot at

587
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:41,529
life maybe they weren't out of the game

588
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:47,289
just yet

589
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:48,789
I and again like in retrospect it seems

590
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:50,649
crazy that the State Department would

591
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:52,720
have gone with Wang to try to branch out

592
00:27:50,649 --> 00:27:55,059
into more general-purpose computing or

593
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,369
into mini computers but they'd been with

594
00:27:55,059 --> 00:28:01,149
Wang as a word-processing supplier for

595
00:27:57,369 --> 00:28:03,039
you know decades at that point and you

596
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:07,539
can never underestimate the power of

597
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:09,279
inertia and procurement decisions I so

598
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:11,470
if you're not sure what foggy bottom

599
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,820
does and and I think we've established

600
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,350
that the workings of the federal

601
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,330
government are pretty mysterious to

602
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,158
anybody that doesn't work in DC and it's

603
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:21,970
mysterious to those of us who do as well

604
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:25,239
often and like the State Department

605
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:27,039
suffers a kind of existential they've

606
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,629
suffered an existential crisis for about

607
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,379
the past 20 years since the collapse of

608
00:28:28,629 --> 00:28:33,340
the Soviet Union what do we actually do

609
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:35,889
but one of those State Department's

610
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,049
primary functions is to write memos

611
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:39,639
cables briefings advisories reports you

612
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,529
would not believe the amount of text

613
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:43,178
that this organization is capable of

614
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:44,590
producing and it has always been like

615
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:47,259
that

616
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,759
so it's it is odd to think of it now

617
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,799
because government agencies are not

618
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:53,320
generally known for being early adopters

619
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,480
but if you have an entire institution

620
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,210
whose primary function is to write to

621
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,029
itself and write to other people it

622
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:03,580
turns out that they will take on you

623
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:05,679
know office automation and and word

624
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,840
processing technologies really really

625
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,909
quickly and they will spend huge amounts

626
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,959
of money on them because it turns out

627
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:18,850
that that's worth it however this is a

628
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:21,309
sad story after all and and despite the

629
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:25,469
State Department's best efforts and Wang

630
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:29,980
and n Wang Labs and best efforts I by

631
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:32,499
1995 it was clear that you know note

632
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,490
with salvaging Wang was not going to

633
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:36,009
save the State Department's IT

634
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,480
infrastructure and the horrible part

635
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:40,240
about this is that the State Department

636
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:43,539
never really recovered the IT posture

637
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,909
that it had back in the 80s when they

638
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:48,580
discovered you know word processors made

639
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,840
their lives a lot better and they've

640
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,279
been struggling with this ever since

641
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,559
because they were given extraordinary

642
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,019
license to spend enormous amounts of

643
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:58,269
money on technologies that served a

644
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:01,210
single function which happened to be the

645
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:02,889
function that they needed but then

646
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:08,289
general-purpose computing happened and

647
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:12,219
everything went up in flames but just to

648
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:15,340
come back to the O&M versus DME point

649
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,169
that i made earlier this is from

650
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,149
testimony that secretary Warren

651
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:22,059
Christopher gave to the Senate

652
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:24,369
Appropriations Committee in 1995 talking

653
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:31,139
about the 1996 budget for the State

654
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:35,080
Department and if you can trust this

655
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:37,149
pitiful 30 2.8 million dollar capital

656
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,460
investment fund that he used begging for

657
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:43,658
so that they can have one classified

658
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:46,960
mainframe that works compare that to the

659
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:51,580
840 1.3 million dollars for the wang

660
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,619
contract and again this is this is why

661
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,119
procurement is broken and this is why we

662
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:57,669
generally can't have nice things either

663
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:00,939
in you know large orgs

664
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:05,290
you know in large org description be

665
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:07,330
they public or private sector and I

666
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:09,070
figured that after that also very

667
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:12,250
depressing story we might need a small

668
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,899
comic interlude I Wang was so pervasive

669
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:16,720
in the State Department systems that

670
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:20,070
their entire communications protocol

671
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,920
books that reference Wang protocols and

672
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:25,750
in reading these because why not i

673
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,600
discovered the single best acronym in

674
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:31,000
the history of the state department

675
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,530
which is the wang one way interface for

676
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,330
transmission or wowie

677
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:36,280
for transmissions from unclassified

678
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:41,590
systems to Post classified telco

679
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:47,110
processors so in the end and always

680
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:48,909
right and complexity kills I and you

681
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,699
know you're you're you're a large org

682
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:58,020
will succumb to inertia and probably end

683
00:31:51,700 --> 00:32:04,870
up like this sad submarine moving on to

684
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:07,480
underlying causes one of the reasons why

685
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:09,459
we Hughes so hard to operations and

686
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,680
maintenance over capital expenditures is

687
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,690
because we are absolutely convinced that

688
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,560
we just need to fix this one thing and

689
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:19,960
it will continue being fine and you can

690
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:25,510
see this at work in our industry all the

691
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:29,380
damn time and I admire the optimism of

692
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:35,310
people who think that we will they that

693
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:40,120
that we can eliminate everything over I

694
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:41,889
I don't I know no my actually my

695
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,810
favorite thing about this about this

696
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:46,390
image is if you look in the background

697
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:50,200
you can see the endless field of

698
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:52,330
repeating windmills so even if you pick

699
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,440
a great windmill to joust there are

700
00:32:52,330 --> 00:33:00,520
always going to be more windmills so

701
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,110
instead of instead of queuing to the onm

702
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,910
model of the world and trying to squash

703
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,449
bugs one by one and eliminate the

704
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:09,130
problems and our existing systems until

705
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,029
you know until they work magically and

706
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:13,989
do everything that there's

707
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:15,940
Bost you again you know there is a

708
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:17,499
species of magical thinking in the other

709
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,450
direction which is that we can just

710
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:21,450
abandon everything and migrate to

711
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,979
something new and the truth

712
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:27,279
unfortunately inconveniently is kind of

713
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:28,779
in the middle and this is a slide from a

714
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,289
talk that you can also catch this

715
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:34,809
afternoon which is rito and Domenic

716
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:38,440
talking about rust on grape fed this is

717
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:41,619
from the heidelberg version of this but

718
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,149
in the other direction for those who

719
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,609
think that maybe we just need to abandon

720
00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:48,459
the old systems and you know leap

721
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:51,580
bravely into the new world and get rid

722
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:54,669
of everything that we know like we will

723
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:57,039
never get rid of see like that is just a

724
00:33:54,669 --> 00:34:00,009
fact of life there are still active

725
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,529
industries where sea is king you have to

726
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:04,719
deal with the in hearing unsafe nosov

727
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:10,109
that language and we are just stuck with

728
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:14,349
it however that means that really really

729
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:15,940
that means that in dealing with the

730
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:17,950
realities of see that doesn't mean that

731
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,230
you have to lose all hope and for

732
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:22,538
example things like getting rust working

733
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,250
on great but for for embedded

734
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:26,919
development is really helpful

735
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,690
I imagine that places like the FDA are

736
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:31,388
gonna be really excited if they can get

737
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,819
IOT producers to be developing products

738
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:37,389
on you know memory safe systems that

739
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:39,639
would be great and there's other work

740
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:41,679
going on in this area as well but this

741
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,980
is hard stuff

742
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,659
I think Joffrey Cooper II published a

743
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,789
paper earlier this year called writing

744
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:51,279
parsers like it's 2017

745
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:53,679
and he did a test case where he was able

746
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:56,020
to jam like a Russ parser into a pile of

747
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,700
rust of cruft ec code in the form of the

748
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:03,970
VLC media player and make it go and like

749
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:06,930
that that sounds awful but it's actually

750
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,930
really important

751
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:14,140
another form of magical thinking related

752
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:16,420
to squashing bugs one by one I we have

753
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,960
this problem with exploit and O'Day

754
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,690
fetishism in this industry which isn't

755
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:26,730
just impractical it's it's

756
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:28,619
also really useless and getting back you

757
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,970
know this is people are going to have

758
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,500
feelings about this one way or the other

759
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,480
but getting back to the dangerous world

760
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,700
that Senator Wyden alluded to last year

761
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,829
like yes there there are hacking tools

762
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,720
in the hands of governments and some

763
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:41,339
governments misuse them however

764
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,899
mischaracterizing the nature of those

765
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:45,328
hacking tools doesn't do anybody any

766
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,490
favors as we try to work on policy

767
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:50,970
solutions to make sure that they are not

768
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:55,109
used for human rights abuses and this is

769
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:57,509
a slide from Sergey go Livanos hacking

770
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:59,369
team and gamma international in business

771
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:05,970
to government malware that he gave in

772
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:07,859
berlin back in i think that was 2013 and

773
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:11,339
this was a researcher who tore apart

774
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:13,140
some who tore apart hacking teams RCS

775
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:16,020
looking for the sweet exploits that

776
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:19,890
surely were being used against the

777
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:22,020
unsuspecting victims and found yeah

778
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,578
we're actually not talking exploitation

779
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,180
and that trend is i think become more

780
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:29,369
clear we're seeing things like

781
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,660
customized phishing its scale now a lot

782
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:32,430
more than we're seeing exploit kits

783
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:38,038
especially since neutrino and black hole

784
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:40,020
have died but yes so squashing bugs one

785
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:43,079
by one actually turns out to be a really

786
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,309
rubbish approach to to any set of

787
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,099
problems like whether you're trying to

788
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:49,470
secure an org or just a single piece of

789
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:50,849
software it is one of the pieces of

790
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,490
magical thinking that i really wish

791
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:55,680
would die but you know it's satisfying

792
00:36:53,490 --> 00:37:00,390
like you squash one bug you are one more

793
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,430
secure right like and it's it's really

794
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,859
difficult to train people off of that

795
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:07,078
thinking where you're like no i don't

796
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:10,589
really care that you've given me a way

797
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,270
to report you know like memory

798
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:15,779
corruption vulnerabilities in this thing

799
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:18,000
I want you to I want you to do like do

800
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:20,599
Joffrey's magic and make those not a

801
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,599
problem anymore

802
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:29,520
so in terms of sorting I think the the

803
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:33,690
most important concept that I can

804
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,970
communicate to you is that there is a

805
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:38,180
massive deficit

806
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:42,470
of translation layer in in information

807
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:43,759
security right now and for all of these

808
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,330
magical thinking problems that I've

809
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,270
described whether we're talking about

810
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:53,900
the fact that you know terrorism doesn't

811
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:56,270
happen because crypto or that you cannot

812
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,670
band-aid your way back to like a

813
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:02,840
functional back to functional enterprise

814
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:05,180
software if it's 30-plus years old one

815
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:08,810
of the most discouraging things that I

816
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:11,569
see corporate actors doing is trying to

817
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:13,250
throw engineers at the problem so if

818
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:16,040
they have a policy issue they throw an

819
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:18,050
engineer at it and that actually doesn't

820
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,200
work out all that well and I feel pretty

821
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:23,240
bad because at my at my invitation some

822
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,330
of my more you know technical friends

823
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:29,149
have accepted invitations to you know

824
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,799
August August bodies or think tanks in

825
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:34,460
Europe and the United States and they've

826
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,020
had terrible experiences if you really

827
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,520
really know how computers work and you

828
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:42,650
go sit in a room full of policy people

829
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:44,810
like you're gonna hate your life so my

830
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:47,960
solution to that is that if you're a

831
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:50,360
great engineer be a great engineer this

832
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,070
is actually somebody else's job we

833
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,530
haven't done a great job we haven't done

834
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,750
we haven't done very well at defining

835
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:59,090
the general ISM or the specific skill

836
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,820
sets that constitute this but there's a

837
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:03,020
there's a fairly healthy cohort of us

838
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:07,580
that are like trying to muddle through

839
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:10,759
it and and figure that out but yeah be

840
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:14,240
be great engineers and don't don't do

841
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,830
things that make you hate your life and

842
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,419
you know it's not a keynote unless you

843
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:23,000
put up something by Dan Geary

844
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:25,100
so so this is this is one of my favorite

845
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,780
quotes from him and I I think I've been

846
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,730
using it for at least two years now I

847
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:33,950
think I first used this a MOOC on back

848
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:35,930
in no only last year it was 2016 so if

849
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,279
you ever wanted to be taken seriously

850
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:39,560
you know it used to be the problem that

851
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,810
just I IT was ignored security is

852
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,970
ignored and now we are extremely

853
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:47,270
listened to and one of the problems is

854
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:50,000
that we are giving extremely bad or

855
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:54,080
miscalibrated advice

856
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,630
and what do I mean by that

857
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,220
so it's it's not just the engineers that

858
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:02,810
suffer when we try to approach this

859
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:09,379
problem in that manner I policy suffers

860
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:13,130
as well and what we get is what we get

861
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:16,310
on the flip side is when you know when

862
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:20,240
organizations like or when when think

863
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:23,270
tanks try to try to tackle the cyber

864
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,020
issue they end up disproportionately

865
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:28,580
relying on popular press citations and

866
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,050
that is true even of academic

867
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:33,200
institutions that have been around since

868
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:34,970
the 18th century like this is a

869
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,660
publication from probably one of the

870
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:40,879
most respected academic institutions in

871
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,490
the United States and even they have

872
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,130
this problem so if you look at the

873
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:49,490
breakdown this was on governance of

874
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:54,830
dual-use technologies in three areas

875
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:57,549
nuclear nuclear biological and cyber as

876
00:40:54,830 --> 00:41:00,860
if that's a thing

877
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:02,510
but for nuclear in bio the number of

878
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,650
popular press citations and I'm talking

879
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,750
like the New York Times or The Wall

880
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,580
Street Journal two out of hundred and

881
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,370
forty-three three out of hundred and

882
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:13,220
twenty five in the cyber section it was

883
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:17,660
27 out of a hundred and ten or a quarter

884
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:20,779
and if I had eliminated like if I if I

885
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:22,460
had more broadly defined popular press

886
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:27,800
it would have been closer to half for

887
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:29,930
60% and like this is a really

888
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:35,680
fundamental reason why the policy

889
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:38,080
situation sucks as badly as it does and

890
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,290
like just

891
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,290
[Music]

892
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,129
and this this is not a theoretical

893
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:49,670
problem either like I I think if that if

894
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:52,860
if that illustration isn't vivid enough

895
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:54,630
this actually happened not long after I

896
00:41:52,860 --> 00:42:00,030
gave the first version of this talk at

897
00:41:54,630 --> 00:42:02,280
troopers I and in this case a statistic

898
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:05,610
that claimed that was variously

899
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:09,030
attributed to the National Cyber

900
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:13,050
Security Alliance and to Symantec and a

901
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:15,780
bunch of other places this statistic

902
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:18,750
claimed that 60% of small businesses

903
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:21,540
that suffer cyber attack will go out of

904
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,790
business within six months and you can

905
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:26,160
imagine that if you are a law maker or

906
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:28,230
regulator or even just a professional

907
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,149
guffy sitting in DC and you hear a

908
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:33,300
statistic like that that's gonna stop

909
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:35,610
you dead in your tracks and this

910
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:38,130
actually ended up being cited in

911
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:40,110
legislation and it turned out that there

912
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:42,630
was no basis for this whatsoever

913
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:44,430
like there was no study there was no

914
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:46,530
grounding it was something that had

915
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:49,319
shown up in a relatively well-respected

916
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:51,270
publication and then played telephone

917
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,910
throughout the entire cyber policy

918
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:56,220
universe until it ended up in

919
00:42:53,910 --> 00:43:02,009
legislation and I have seen this happen

920
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:05,580
more than once so like when we look at

921
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:11,400
this part of the reason that we get this

922
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:14,009
is because we have legislature

923
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,560
legislators law makers and regulators

924
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:18,740
relying on white papers from for-profit

925
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:24,000
companies for subject matter expertise

926
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:27,240
and this is this might be difficult to

927
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,740
hear or shocking even but informational

928
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:35,160
security really sucks at government

929
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:37,350
affairs like badly and one of the ways

930
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,810
that other industry is correct for

931
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:42,240
misinformation is they will send people

932
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:44,070
to sit on volunteer technical advisory

933
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,390
committees in all parts of government

934
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:49,770
and these are actually pretty fun I do

935
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,359
work on some of the ones at the

936
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:54,290
Department of

937
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:56,270
and in one of them we do emerging

938
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,670
technologies and research and so we got

939
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:02,090
to talk about cool things like

940
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:06,590
hypersonic weapons and gene crispers and

941
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:09,110
like fun and stuff but the core problem

942
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:11,000
is that the private sector participants

943
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:13,130
in these technical advisory committees

944
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,250
we're not paid like we are all

945
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:19,280
volunteers and getting information

946
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:22,640
security companies or getting just

947
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,800
technology companies to really engage as

948
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,129
public sector partners is really really

949
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,590
difficult and the mature ones do it and

950
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,360
they'll do it well and they show up and

951
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:35,870
they can be subject matter experts and

952
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:38,030
they can keep stuff like this and like

953
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:41,029
that from having to horrible of an

954
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:43,070
impact but if you don't have the subject

955
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:45,140
matter experts from your area showing up

956
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:47,270
in order to fight these fires when they

957
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:55,730
happen guess what it ends up in

958
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:58,550
legislation so again I would say in

959
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:01,490
closing or getting towards closing but

960
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:05,300
if you really want to do something if

961
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:08,540
you want to thwart effectively the

962
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:11,420
effective thing to do is not this the

963
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,830
effective thing to do is to look at the

964
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,750
policy problems that interest you that

965
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:17,690
are relevant to your concerns and your

966
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:19,970
org find the relevant agencies or

967
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:22,400
departments that deal with that problem

968
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:24,470
and look at the help that they're asking

969
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,430
for because every single one of them

970
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:30,220
asks for help an outgoing assistant

971
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:33,649
secretary from the last administration

972
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:35,930
told me on his way out the door that the

973
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:38,480
one thing he hadn't succeeded in in six

974
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:41,569
years was convincing everybody that

975
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,520
there wasn't a secret handshake that if

976
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:45,410
they wanted to get something done the

977
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,330
trick wasn't finding the right person or

978
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,970
saying the right thing or you know

979
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:51,830
making the right noises they make it

980
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:53,779
really really clear what you have to do

981
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:56,180
in order to be heard you submit comments

982
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:58,550
to an advisory committee and like

983
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,290
there's a forum online that you can use

984
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,710
or you can show up and give them in

985
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,810
person

986
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:04,910
and there's an email address and it

987
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:06,560
all over the website and it says hey if

988
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:10,750
you have thoughts about these proposed

989
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:13,220
about proposed rulemaking do it here and

990
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:15,920
people don't hear this and they don't

991
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,810
hear it to the extent that on the day

992
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,030
that there was a meeting regarding the

993
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:21,920
intrusion software controls or the

994
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,780
proposed intrusion software controls

995
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,190
that the United States has not

996
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,470
implemented from the pops in our

997
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,680
arrangement instead of submitting

998
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:32,720
comments to subject matter experts

999
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,839
published an op-ed in Politico or the

1000
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,399
hill or something and as I was talking

1001
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,170
to this person you know

1002
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,730
the former assistant secretary was just

1003
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,980
like I don't understand why they did

1004
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:44,330
that like they could have copy pasted

1005
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,040
the text and submitted it in his

1006
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:47,960
comments and then we could have used it

1007
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:50,779
that would have been listed but by

1008
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:54,530
leaving it in press we can't touch that

1009
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:56,210
and yeah it's quirky and it's weird

1010
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,560
but there are things that government has

1011
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,930
to do in order to ensure transparency

1012
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,340
and accountability and this is one of

1013
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:04,250
the annoying things that you just have

1014
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:06,470
to do if you work with if you work in

1015
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:08,110
that space like they need to be able to

1016
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:10,790
have a paper trail that says like you

1017
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:12,470
authentically you private sector person

1018
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:14,450
showed up to this meeting or we're

1019
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:18,770
interested enough to submit comments and

1020
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:20,509
that has real weight because the one

1021
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:23,720
thing that is true both on the political

1022
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:26,390
side and on and in the executive

1023
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:28,339
agencies is that you know they don't

1024
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:30,500
care about the mass action click click

1025
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:32,030
like feel good campaigns they want to

1026
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,340
know what real people think and they

1027
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:36,860
want thoughtful considered contributions

1028
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:41,210
a single one of those is worth more than

1029
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:42,710
10,000 of those forms so I would say

1030
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:45,320
that if you're looking for places to

1031
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:46,280
have an impact like those are really

1032
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:51,350
good places to start

1033
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:52,820
because any any agency or or you know

1034
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:55,339
government body that deals with

1035
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:58,220
information security and they basically

1036
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,780
all have to do now they know that

1037
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,189
they're getting it wrong and it's not

1038
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:04,100
like they wake up in the morning wanting

1039
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:05,600
it to be like that nobody wakes up and

1040
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:09,710
says hey I'm gonna craft some

1041
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:12,650
horrendously bad policy today and they

1042
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:14,750
actually do listen so I think when I

1043
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:15,269
post I'm gonna be all post these slides

1044
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,640
on

1045
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:20,968
probably on my github and add a couple

1046
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:24,449
of pages of like helpful links to you

1047
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:27,979
know examples of you know for real

1048
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:30,839
impactful things that that folks can do

1049
00:48:27,979 --> 00:48:33,718
but in sort of broad strokes

1050
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:36,899
I think the forward motion that we need

1051
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:39,209
to be developing is primarily folk is

1052
00:48:36,899 --> 00:48:41,640
primarily in those translation layers so

1053
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:44,640
how do we communicate fluently between

1054
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,229
technical and mission space and if you

1055
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,759
remember the the ballistic missile

1056
00:48:46,229 --> 00:48:53,399
submarine like my my favorite story

1057
00:48:50,759 --> 00:48:54,779
about a submarine is about my younger

1058
00:48:53,399 --> 00:48:58,859
brother who happens to be a nuclear

1059
00:48:54,779 --> 00:49:01,199
naval officer and on his very first

1060
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:04,199
deployment and he was engineering

1061
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:05,909
officer of the watch which is a very

1062
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:09,029
stressful position to be in if you're on

1063
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:10,559
you know I think a tube underwater with

1064
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:13,859
a trash can sized nuclear reactor

1065
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,659
running it so his very first deployment

1066
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:17,788
his energy his engineering officer of

1067
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:20,369
the watch he gets racket out of bed so

1068
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:25,169
called out at like you know Oh dark

1069
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:27,059
thirty and he gets taken down to a part

1070
00:49:25,169 --> 00:49:28,979
of the ship where there is a problem and

1071
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:30,689
it is a big problem and there is an

1072
00:49:28,979 --> 00:49:33,479
engineer that has diagnosed the problem

1073
00:49:30,689 --> 00:49:35,609
and together the engineer and the

1074
00:49:33,479 --> 00:49:37,578
engineering officer go to the captain

1075
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:39,959
and they briefed the captain of the boat

1076
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:40,739
now if the engineer had gone directly to

1077
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:42,899
the captain

1078
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:45,479
I'm really not sure that that problem

1079
00:49:42,899 --> 00:49:46,799
would ever have been solved because you

1080
00:49:45,479 --> 00:49:50,069
would have been missing the translation

1081
00:49:46,799 --> 00:49:52,139
layer of the engineering officer and I'm

1082
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:53,699
not advocating for the you know an

1083
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:55,889
explosion of middle management

1084
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:58,499
in information security but we have to

1085
00:49:55,889 --> 00:50:00,719
find some happy middle ground there and

1086
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:02,609
because this ballistic missile submarine

1087
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,199
hadn't and had an engineering officer

1088
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:05,939
the problem got fixed and nobody got

1089
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:08,309
hurt and you know the boat was merrily

1090
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:10,769
underway however I have seen that story

1091
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:13,949
and very differently in our space a lot

1092
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:15,479
of times the second thing that we can be

1093
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:18,389
doing is better the standard of

1094
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:21,808
documentation in in technical and policy

1095
00:50:18,389 --> 00:50:25,619
research and in the technical space this

1096
00:50:21,809 --> 00:50:27,370
means being more methodical using you

1097
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:29,980
know not inventing a new tax on

1098
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:34,660
every time every time the mood strikes

1099
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:38,430
it means trying to communicate things in

1100
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:41,350
a way that makes them reproducible and

1101
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:43,450
like this is a serious issue and and I

1102
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:45,100
appreciate the spirit of I appreciate

1103
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:48,970
the spirit of I found this cool thing

1104
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:50,380
and I can do it this once but if we want

1105
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:53,379
to build on that and if we want to build

1106
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:56,050
actual you know operational solutions on

1107
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,660
that we have to be doing better in terms

1108
00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:00,730
of documenting our own research and also

1109
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:02,710
in relating it to other existing work

1110
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,450
you know the number of black hat and DEF

1111
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:05,740
CON talks that I've seen where it's like

1112
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:08,109
somebody just appeared from the

1113
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:10,600
wilderness with their fully formed idea

1114
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:13,420
that had never been touched by anybody

1115
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,250
else before is a little bit

1116
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:19,090
disconcerting so yeah literature reviews

1117
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:21,130
this would be good and the last one is

1118
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:22,840
just sort of coming to terms with the

1119
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:27,940
inter linkage of science and politics

1120
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:31,240
like we can't opt out of engaging with

1121
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:33,010
the government space and you know even

1122
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,799
people like me would love to at this

1123
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:38,980
point but that's an unfortunate reality

1124
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:42,160
that we just have to deal with and one

1125
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:44,110
of the one of the things that I've

1126
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,690
observed this year that has been

1127
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:49,240
different from every other year is that

1128
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,950
the nature of governance you know

1129
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,379
professional government goes on being

1130
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:55,990
professional government but there

1131
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:58,480
currently use the state of flux that has

1132
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:03,609
not been seen since probably before I

1133
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:05,500
was born and our social contract is more

1134
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:08,200
or less being rewritten right now by

1135
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:11,260
anybody who cares to show up and it

1136
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:15,160
profoundly worries me that not a lot of

1137
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:17,290
people from this space are showing up so

1138
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:20,200
if if you need any further encouragement

1139
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:22,630
to you know try to find a way forward

1140
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:26,410
through this it is that there is so much

1141
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:29,050
up for grabs right now and the people

1142
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:32,759
who are showing up to opportunistically

1143
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:35,170
manipulate these this situation are

1144
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,200
generally not great people so it would

1145
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:39,550
be it would be nice to have like it

1146
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,910
would be nice to have more company in

1147
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:44,880
this

1148
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:44,879
space I guess is what I'm saying anyway

1149
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,120
you
