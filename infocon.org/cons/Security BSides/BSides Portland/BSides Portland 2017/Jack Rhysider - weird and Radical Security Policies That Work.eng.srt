1
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:23,770
my name is Jack reciter and I've been a

2
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,840
working as an in an MS SP for the last

3
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:28,900
ten years currently working in the sock

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,509
doing building out the architecture for

5
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,219
the sock building out policies tech not

6
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:35,260
techniques the whole whole nine yards

7
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:37,300
and I've been running a blog called

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,829
tunnels up for a while and just this

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,288
week I launched a new podcast called

10
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:44,110
darknet Diaries and I urge you you've

11
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:45,699
had some listeners excellent so please

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,170
if you like podcasts and you like

13
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:49,300
security check that out

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,310
so this is actually the fourth

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,030
conference I've been security conference

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,989
I've been to this year and I just love

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,430
coming to these things because I love

18
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,839
talking to you guys and hearing how

19
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,809
you're solving the same problems that's

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,350
me and some of the ways you guys solve

21
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:06,820
problems is weird okay and and you know

22
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,320
some of the stuff is just best practices

23
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,148
and I'm like yeah yeah got it I've read

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,309
that book but you know some of the stuff

25
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:14,200
makes me go what so I thought I'd just

26
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,960
kind of pull in all that stuff together

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,819
in one talk and talk about some of the

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,199
the things that I thought were we're out

29
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:22,359
of the box and I'll let you guys decide

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,609
if that is out of the box and I brought

31
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:27,449
a special guest with us Jeff and we'll

32
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:30,158
learn about what he has to offer leader

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,689
so start out chaos monkey this is

34
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,969
probably the most standard weird and

35
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:35,708
radical thing if you haven't heard of

36
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,029
this one this is something that netflix

37
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:39,670
has developed and deployed in their

38
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:42,670
network and basically I think once a day

39
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:46,119
it goes out to a production system and

40
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,009
shuts it down and the reason for that is

41
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,599
because they want to have as a resilient

42
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:51,490
of a network as they can and they think

43
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,969
if they shut things down just randomly

44
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,568
then they will have better job at

45
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,538
detecting when things are down

46
00:01:55,569 --> 00:02:02,020
responding to that and making it back up

47
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:05,349
so it I could never get my manager to

48
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,449
deploy this in my network this is an

49
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:09,098
open source project and you can go and

50
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,110
deploy it in yours if you think you can

51
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:14,049
get management approval to take your

52
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,410
production network down on purpose but

53
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,209
it has definitely made Amazon a more

54
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,040
robust network and and you know

55
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:22,720
sorry Netflix did I say I was on the

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,600
first time I meant to say Netflix this

57
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,490
is a Netflix created thing and and

58
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,470
basically

59
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:32,590
you know they've just gotten better at

60
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,880
at resiliency because of this so who

61
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,310
thinks this is a weird and radical

62
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,530
security solution all right we got a

63
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,840
couple hands get weirder as we go guys

64
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,180
so can't talk about chaos monkey without

65
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,370
also talking about infection monkey this

66
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,700
I learned about from blackhat last year

67
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,500
and what this one does is it's it's

68
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,109
malware that you can use as like a

69
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,720
security engineer to go and infect your

70
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:59,050
users in your network and what you'll do

71
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,810
with this is you'll test to see if their

72
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,640
antivirus exists and if it's susceptible

73
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,320
to certain malware and you're basically

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,820
going and infecting your users with

75
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,620
malware now this malware doesn't do

76
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,590
anything other than just infect it and

77
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,330
then report back to you that there I was

78
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,670
able to get into this system something's

79
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,140
probably wrong that I was able to infect

80
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,089
this and this is also an open source

81
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,890
project so you can go and deploy this in

82
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,170
your network it's pretty robust it has

83
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,630
its own command and control mechanism so

84
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,220
that when it does infect a computer it

85
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,900
then comes back and tells the

86
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,720
command-and-control hey I got into this

87
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,670
system and so from from the you know

88
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,560
command control station you can see how

89
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,179
effective your malware is in your own

90
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,510
network so this is a tool to use

91
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:44,110
internally to try to infect your CEO in

92
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:46,230
the middle of his presentation so who

93
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,010
thinks this one is weird and radical a

94
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,619
couple more hands all right we're

95
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:55,750
getting there thank you we'll skip that

96
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:57,640
one so I was doing a vulnerability scan

97
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,280
for my client for a while and he said I

98
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,070
want you to do an nmap scan on my users

99
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,170
and I was like why like I don't quite

100
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,570
get the rash now there and his point was

101
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,920
I want to determine whether or not they

102
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,950
have ports open that they shouldn't have

103
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,160
open okay so we scanned the users it

104
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,289
only took 15 minutes to scan his user

105
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,190
space and we sure enough we found ports

106
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,170
that were open that shouldn't have been

107
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,250
people were running services that they

108
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,620
shouldn't have been and it was such a

109
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,690
it's a free tool it was so quick and

110
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,360
easy to do that we ended up doing it on

111
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,370
a daily basis and I think we're going to

112
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,480
probably end up doing it on a basis

113
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,500
every eight hours because there's

114
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,630
different people in the office every

115
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,240
eight hours and the thing that I think

116
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,310
this is so radical is because it's a

117
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,090
free tool and it's so easy to do but I

118
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,250
haven't heard

119
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,159
anybody just doing it on such a periodic

120
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:48,970
basis so you tell me is this a weird and

121
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,139
radical security solution maybe not it's

122
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,830
something you know you probably should

123
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:56,650
do Jeff you're up next so I brought we

124
00:04:53,830 --> 00:05:03,120
have a very special guest today we have

125
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:07,359
Jeff he he's gonna tell us about a weird

126
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,760
thing do that he does ah so this isn't a

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,669
former agency I worked at we had malware

128
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,889
users 3000 users all over the state

129
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:18,099
doing stupid stuff clicking on emails

130
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:19,630
getting malware infections or we have

131
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,960
anti-malware we have a big layered

132
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:27,070
defense but we still have problems so we

133
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,960
used our host base IDs the malware tool

134
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,940
anti-malware tool and the host-based

135
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,919
firewall to create a thing where if

136
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,479
you've got four positive hits even

137
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,130
though the malware in time our tool

138
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,810
cleaned it we shut you off the network

139
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,389
clearance it down to just talking to our

140
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,810
AV server and this pops up on your

141
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:45,550
screen and you're being logged off your

142
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,990
malware is detected on your computer if

143
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,700
you have questions contact our security

144
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,740
operations center we did this with lots

145
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,240
of messaging beforehand we shut your

146
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,979
machine down and tagged you in our tool

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,990
so every time you connect back to the

148
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:01,030
network it downloads a package within

149
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,490
five minutes runs a batch file flashes

150
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,500
this screen and shuts you back down your

151
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:10,599
firewall is clamped down to just talk to

152
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:12,700
our EPO server so this is automatic four

153
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:14,680
times even though the antivirus cleaned

154
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,200
it it's good the first time an antivirus

155
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,039
can't clean something you're offline

156
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,810
within five minutes and we have done

157
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,620
this everybody was worried well what

158
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,840
have you shut down the whole network

159
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,970
within five minutes everybody's back on

160
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:34,060
after we removed the tag from the

161
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:36,010
automation in the EPO and this works we

162
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,570
went to having to send text and run

163
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,090
through buildings after hours to try to

164
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,139
figure out where a PC was remote to it

165
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,479
shut it down make sure it's off the

166
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,849
network all that crazy stuff during a

167
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,620
malware incident whether it was user

168
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:50,140
initiated or somebody getting a watering

169
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,110
hole attack - verifying that the Machine

170
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,669
shut down and letting helpdesk

171
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,470
come and pick it up at the beginning of

172
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:59,050
business hours the next day because it's

173
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,300
offline no access to anything and it'll

174
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,540
keep turning itself off I have a

175
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:09,310
question how did you get um so our CIO

176
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:12,730
clicked on a invoice dot docx file and

177
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:16,330
we replaced 42 machines within six hours

178
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:18,340
in the executive suite and it was

179
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,580
determined that something like this

180
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,409
might be a better option because not all

181
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,030
42 of those machines were guaranteed hit

182
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:28,240
with malware we just know that that

183
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,309
email was sent to them and they opened

184
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,050
it in Outlook they didn't actually have

185
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,510
to action on the dock that was included

186
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,520
but we didn't know so we just grabbed

187
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:41,940
everybody's computer desktop hated us

188
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:44,680
for like they still do but we got them

189
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,770
fixed and then the next time we had a

190
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,130
mass exposure we had all the computers

191
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,289
off the network because this is 3,000

192
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,120
state computers across this state in

193
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,800
different agencies we had them off the

194
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,900
network all the infected computers are

195
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,270
potentially infected victims until we

196
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,320
could get forensic details and we could

197
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,719
turn them back on after we did a

198
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,849
case-by-case evaluation and that stopped

199
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,530
the panic of what happens if it gets to

200
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,810
an important computer and that was the

201
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,640
whole point of this was stop the bleed

202
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,070
you know this is a tourniquet on the

203
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,800
field for a gunshot that you can reverse

204
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,950
with a simple command to your automation

205
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,950
tool

206
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,729
so it's locked down once the tags

207
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,409
applied it locks down the firewall and

208
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,899
that stays locked down until it gets

209
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:39,568
untagged but it will download the

210
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,740
package to do this prompt and reboot

211
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:44,430
their computer and shut it down

212
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,560
so I tagged one of our Sauk responders

213
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,449
who got malware more than he was

214
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,500
supposed to because they don't really do

215
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:52,109
what they're supposed to and use their

216
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:56,399
off network computers and then I was

217
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:59,009
sick for two days and I got call him the

218
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,250
second day saying hey my computer's not

219
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:04,350
working and I was like oh yeah

220
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,240
I had to login untag him so he could get

221
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,459
his computer back going but it kept him

222
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,680
offline and he was able to do his work

223
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,739
on a different computer but his infected

224
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,870
computer was contained

225
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,699
so some users they get the same message

226
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,319
they call helpdesk helpdesk tells them

227
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:20,250
somebody will be there and we put a

228
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:22,378
replacement

229
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,529
thank you Jeff so who here thinks Jeff's

230
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:33,269
solution is weird or radical

231
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:36,629
he's just weird a radical guy ah so

232
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:38,750
that's a really good question and one

233
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:42,420
that I wish desktop had thought of

234
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,709
because our whole stance is we're

235
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,259
protecting the network its desktop

236
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:48,540
responses responsibility to keep backup

237
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,519
computers we started with eight malware

238
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,349
replacement laptops because we typically

239
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,660
see one or two users get affected by

240
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,550
this when we had the 42 users in the

241
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,290
suite done people were without a

242
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,199
computer for a day as machines were

243
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:04,529
being reimaged and replaced and that's

244
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:07,319
one hour huh says one hour it says one

245
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:09,600
hour that is what desktop agreed to but

246
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:11,790
they didn't think through the response

247
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,709
on that and that's once again that's not

248
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,769
my security problem that's a problem

249
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:19,229
with the business to justify what is

250
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:21,769
more important saving the network and

251
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:25,500
keeping it safe or having these machines

252
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:27,269
stockpiled to be replaced in a situation

253
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,980
of an incident because the other option

254
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:30,720
is we tell them to turn their computers

255
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,689
off and we wait until desktop gets there

256
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
and then it becomes a desktop speed

257
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:37,380
issue

258
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,839
and we have enough staff it shouldn't be

259
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,500
a problem but we did I don't work there

260
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,060
anymore but the idea is that's a same

261
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,410
problem of how do you fix a broken

262
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,000
computer if somebody steals your

263
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,459
computers how do you do that that's a

264
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:58,650
desktop and hardware management problem

265
00:10:50,460 --> 00:11:02,400
not a security problem for me all right

266
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:03,720
so the next one is the the last speaker

267
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,819
was talking about mu bik's and I think

268
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,820
this is another thing that mu bik's does

269
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,860
in his network is Rob Fuller up

270
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,779
he turns DNS off in his network he

271
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,180
doesn't let any of his users resolve DNS

272
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:19,140
for any external websites internals okay

273
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:21,689
but but externals not and he does this

274
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,370
to prevent malware from being able to do

275
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,410
command and control so it can't resolve

276
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,950
an IP to get out to its things so it

277
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:30,750
gets stuck in the water and I think to

278
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,220
myself well hold on you turn DNS off you

279
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,230
can't get anywhere nobody's everyone's

280
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,820
gonna get the same unable to access the

281
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,650
Internet so what he does is he forces

282
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,640
everyone to go through his proxy and

283
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,530
when they get to the proxy the proxy

284
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,080
knows how to do dns resolution and

285
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,010
that's the only system in his in his in

286
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,140
his network that knows how to do

287
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,390
external DNS resolution and I also see

288
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,100
clients using even though they have DNS

289
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,360
servers inside they're using DNS servers

290
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,640
that are public and stuff and they just

291
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,680
don't know how to do their own internal

292
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,470
DNS so forcing everyone to go through a

293
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,739
proxy I think it's probably a helpful

294
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,150
security mechanism so turning DNS off

295
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,410
for all your users on the inside who

296
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:09,510
thinks that's a weird or radical

297
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:12,420
security policy so this is mu bik's

298
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,970
again Rob Fuller has this so his proxy

299
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,339
all right you've already got this is

300
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:19,680
established his proxy every time someone

301
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,660
tries to go to a website they get this

302
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,729
splash screen that says are you sure you

303
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,319
want to go to this website it nobody's

304
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,820
gone to this before so it only shows up

305
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,100
for the first time you go to the website

306
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,660
and what he's done is instead of going

307
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,250
to his proxy and building all these

308
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,860
rules of what people can and can't go to

309
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,050
he just kind of made that the job of the

310
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,120
of the employees you guys decide what

311
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:42,120
websites you want to go to but by having

312
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,510
this sprats this splash proxy a lot of

313
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,190
stops malware from from getting to sites

314
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,180
that we don't want them to get to so

315
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,100
users are allowed to

316
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,660
say I want to go here but malware

317
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,490
doesn't know how to navigate this and he

318
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,189
actually may decide a flash so it's even

319
00:12:53,490 --> 00:13:02,970
harder from malware to know I want to go

320
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:05,160
to this specific so yeah in this case

321
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,959
flash is good because the you know if

322
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,079
malware can't figure it out so he made

323
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,540
it even weirder by doing vice resetting

324
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,500
the rules on his proxy every month so on

325
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,569
the first of the month

326
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,860
no websites are allowed again everyone

327
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,940
has to go through this again the first

328
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,860
guy in the office first girl in the

329
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,360
office has to say okay I want to go to

330
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:26,850
Google and I want to go to Microsoft and

331
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:29,130
they hit ok a lot yes I think he does

332
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:34,040
record who does that so that we can then

333
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:36,779
track back you know who let his dogs out

334
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,760
he wants to do this on a daily basis

335
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,170
reset it on a daily basis but his

336
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,270
company thinks that's too weird and

337
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,339
radical so who who here thinks this is a

338
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:52,589
weird and radical security solution all

339
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:54,660
right a couple minutes left so some user

340
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:58,410
training ok it's probably a boring

341
00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:00,839
subject but I want to turn so I I wasn't

342
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,000
supposed to find bugs in the network but

343
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,300
I somehow got in I wasn't an ad admin I

344
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,890
somehow got into the ad network and I

345
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,620
was able to change the picture of the

346
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:12,360
CEO and this company and it wasn't too

347
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,510
malicious I just put another celebrity

348
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,940
facing and for him and I didn't report

349
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,290
this that I was able to make ad j--

350
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,440
I shouldn't have been authorized to do

351
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,790
that and so a week later I got changed

352
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,279
back but a year later it's still

353
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,810
possible and why didn't I report this

354
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,089
why didn't I tell someone hey you're a

355
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:34,380
DS not locked down because there was no

356
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:35,640
incentive for me right so I'm this is so

357
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,829
some people what they've done is they've

358
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,449
created an internal bug bounty so that

359
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:41,189
they give out a hundred dollars for

360
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,510
anyone who can find a bug in the network

361
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,310
and it's not five or fifteen dollars

362
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,709
because that's not an incentive enough

363
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:48,359
you've got to have a big enough

364
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:49,770
incentive to get them to say hey I will

365
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,870
send this email because I'll get

366
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,310
something out of it and so I'm making an

367
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,470
internal bug brownie turns all your

368
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,729
users into IDs is basically they're

369
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,779
gonna they're gonna find things and

370
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,209
they're gonna report it to you as

371
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,910
opposed to people like me who do

372
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:05,099
things and they don't report it now some

373
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,360
of you might be thinking man if I did

374
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,639
that I'd be given out a hundred bucks

375
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,470
every day every hour because our network

376
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,660
is so buggy so in your situation

377
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,670
make it a once a quarter the best bug

378
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,929
that gets to report it gets the hundred

379
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,378
dollars so now for four hundred dollars

380
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:20,819
a year you've got you know still a lot

381
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:22,619
of people reporting it and it's not that

382
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:25,979
costly though who thinks this one's

383
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:30,990
weird or radical alright nobody is

384
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:35,759
anybody doing it nice so sticking on

385
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:38,550
user training in my company I have I get

386
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,949
like five hundred dollars a year if I if

387
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,410
I do all the health checks that I need

388
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:45,540
to write I do some health screenings I

389
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,219
do make some health goals I'm eat this

390
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,329
stuff then they say okay we'll give you

391
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,920
the extra hundred dollars it's one of

392
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:52,859
the perks right so why can't we turn

393
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,029
that into a security perk and say well

394
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,309
let's let's carve out four hundred

395
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:58,679
dollars for every person in the company

396
00:15:56,309 --> 00:16:01,439
and if they pass the security challenges

397
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,670
every quarter then we'll give them you

398
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:04,290
know a hundred bucks every quarter and

399
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,059
so one security challenge might be a

400
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,319
phishing campaign if you click the link

401
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,569
you don't get two hundred bucks for that

402
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:11,128
month or that quarter but everyone who

403
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,959
didn't click the link they get that

404
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:15,209
extra bonus right and so we're already

405
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,378
doing this to improve people's health so

406
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:19,018
why can't we improve it people's

407
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:21,170
security in that way and you know every

408
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,279
quarter you could have something so

409
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,139
that's something that I've heard some

410
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,610
people do who thinks that one's weird or

411
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:33,149
radical a couple thank you and actually

412
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,889
so that is twenty minutes so actually

413
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:35,309
we'll go with this one more one more one

414
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:37,499
more

415
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:38,759
I had a client I designed the network

416
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:40,470
for him I was like I got everything

417
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:44,579
under consideration I made your network

418
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:47,220
secure and he said I don't know is it is

419
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,868
it is it secure if there was a tempest

420
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,449
attack I'm like what the hell is a

421
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:53,670
tempest attack so I looked it up and a

422
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:56,699
tempest attack I guess is something

423
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,889
where if when data is traveling over a

424
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:00,899
copper wire it's actually emitting data

425
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:03,389
out of that like beyond so like feet

426
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:05,640
away from that copper wire we can sniff

427
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:08,220
packets off of that and collect that

428
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,260
data and so I said okay we're gonna make

429
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,480
everything fiber and the whole network

430
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,430
and even like laptops

431
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,870
have that cable that goes sorry the the

432
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,070
keyboard has the cable that goes to the

433
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,929
computer that's going to be a copper

434
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,460
wire so we have to only use the

435
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:24,520
keyboards and mice that are on the

436
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:26,350
laptops and I redesigned it with that

437
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,500
and he said okay now you've thought of

438
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:31,149
everything so I thought that one was a

439
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,020
weird and radical approach but he ended

440
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,650
up turning it down

441
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,210
so anyways that's my talk I'm Jack

442
