1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,639
hello everyone I'm Janie shorb and I'm

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,540
here to talk about malicious USB cables

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,639
so a little bit about me I have a

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,540
hardware background I worked at xylog

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,719
with uh analog interfaces to

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,119
microprocessors

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,460
I also worked at broadcom working on

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,320
content addressable memories which is

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,380
like a reverse memory you can give it

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,880
the data and you get the address back

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,160
instead of the other way

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,360
and I'm also working at presently at

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,399
Microsoft as a silicon architect I work

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,520
in the Enterprise Security Group there I

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,520
work on what their Azure sphere product

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,300
which is their secure iot

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,219
device that was actually designed with

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,100
security in mind in the beginning so

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,440
that was quite a fun project so this

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,440
project is on USB

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,379
this is my Master's project so I got a

22
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,600
master's in cyber security this year so

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,820
I just graduated and

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,700
my advisors

25
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,619
my advisors are Brent Lagasse and Arnie

26
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,520
Berger and yang pink

27
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,740
okay so um today we're going to talk

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,780
about spying and extracting Secrets

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,479
which is so cool to understand the

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,500
problem with USB cables I will provide a

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,380
hardware solution some test results and

32
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,880
then talk a little bit about my

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,720
contributions here

34
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,299
so back in the 80s

35
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,700
um the

36
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,220
Russia was spying on the U.S embassy and

37
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,140
um this project is so cool because they

38
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,420
Declassified it as

39
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,420
um it wasn't clear from U.S intelligence

40
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,579
you know where the leak was coming from

41
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,500
and so they have no idea and they're you

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,759
know checking with the staff and they're

43
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,500
sweeping the offices and it's just like

44
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,280
I don't know what's happening and so

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,840
they had this project called project

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,180
gunman and they just grabbed all of

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,280
their hardware and they put it in a an

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,500
off-site location and they just looked

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,259
at every little thing and from that they

50
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,419
were able to find a hardware implant

51
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,980
inside the IBM typewriters and um

52
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,500
this has been happening had been going

53
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,300
on before they found this for eight

54
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,000
years so this is a really good example

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,300
of an advanced persistent threat and

56
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,940
um it's so good like the target of a

57
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,700
keyboard is so perfect because then you

58
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,260
have no encryption that you have to deal

59
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,700
with and you're just taking the letters

60
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,340
out and in this case the letters were

61
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,860
transmitted from the typewriter to a

62
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,319
sensor that came was outside the embassy

63
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,700
so malicious actors have found a new way

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,099
to hide implants inside the USB housing

65
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:54,959
uh so many of you probably have heard

66
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,739
about the USB ducky and this is a common

67
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,980
thing so people hear about flash drives

68
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,959
that are compromised you know never pick

69
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,599
up a flash drive you know but

70
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,580
as it turns out people actually do pick

71
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,319
up flash dies and plug them in mostly

72
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,819
because you know they want to find out

73
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,620
who the owner is or or whatever there's

74
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,200
always some reason

75
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,300
but they do have these malicious flash

76
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,980
drives and what they have is a keystroke

77
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,260
injection attack and so when you plug it

78
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,980
in the USB negotiates and says oh I'm a

79
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,739
keyboard but it's not it's a flash drive

80
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,440
and then it types whatever it wants into

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,379
your system and then it can launch

82
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,480
programs it can do whatever whatever it

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,799
wants on your system when it's plugged

84
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,019
in well

85
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,480
um like will had said earlier you have

86
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,180
to know your attacker or your victim

87
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,379
because

88
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,480
um you could do things that maybe

89
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,099
everybody would have like I know I'm

90
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,440
gonna probably get a window system so

91
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,840
you know maybe I'll I'll launch Edge or

92
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,780
something but

93
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,000
if you're targeting maybe

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,900
um

95
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,959
mobile systems and and they plug in the

96
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,720
USB cord to maybe charge their um

97
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,420
Android device then you know they're

98
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,939
going to be targeting uh Chrome you know

99
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,858
so you have to know a little bit about

100
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,380
the system in order to make these work

101
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,060
but

102
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,919
um

103
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,660
people are a little bit worried about

104
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,240
the attack that comes from the um

105
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,220
flash drives but they haven't really

106
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,220
thought about the USB cable I mean

107
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,199
everybody thinks the USB cable is like

108
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,100
this cable is just some passive wire you

109
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,320
know I don't I don't have any concern

110
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,759
about it you know that's just a cable

111
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,900
right but it's not because the the same

112
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,540
types of compromises that could happen

113
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,620
with with the drive are can be implanted

114
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,600
in this little cable on you just you

115
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
know you just can't tell so I want to

116
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,259
raise an alarm that this is like a snake

117
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,560
right so we have some challenges here

118
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,320
okay

119
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,500
so I will start with a survey on Owen

120
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,419
all the cables that that we have and

121
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,160
we'll start with the with the OMG cable

122
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,380
so this cable

123
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,240
um is quite is more expensive than the

124
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,000
other cables that I have looked at uh

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,180
they're they run around 200 it requires

126
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,280
you to um

127
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,740
program the cable to to whatever it is

128
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,139
that you want to use it has two

129
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,020
different uh ways that it will attack

130
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,060
you so one of them is

131
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,520
the keystroke injection attack just like

132
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,680
the the rubber ducky it just injects

133
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,660
whatever code it wants and pretends to

134
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,479
be a keyboard and the other one is a key

135
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,800
it logs keystrokes so you could have

136
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,740
um I've for example like my um

137
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,080
mechanical uh

138
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,199
keyboard Horizon keyboard and it has a

139
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,240
detachable USB and it's kind of nice if

140
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,000
you're traveling or whatever but if you

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,820
if someone sees you

142
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,800
and they have an OMG cable and they have

143
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,780
a key logger they can just take your

144
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,900
cable replace it with theirs like on you

145
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,919
know you're sitting on an airplane

146
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,380
airplane or something and you wouldn't

147
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,780
necessarily know it because they look

148
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,259
the same right so that is one of the

149
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,120
challenges so this one

150
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,060
um just like the um

151
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,220
just like the ducky

152
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,520
it has one way going in but it also has

153
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,280
just like the IBM typewriters where your

154
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,620
letters are being kept are going out

155
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,639
through Wi-Fi

156
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,160
so this is just a sampling of the OMG

157
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,180
cables that I that I tested they have

158
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,240
the C to C style cable which would like

159
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,180
mimic the power delivery cables they

160
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,160
have the A2 micro b and a to c they also

161
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,620
have an adapter and so all of these

162
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,280
cables are are just you know they also

163
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,039
have the white versions of these but I

164
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,199
just tested the black ones they also

165
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,800
have the lightning cable but I'm not an

166
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,840
apple person so I didn't test them I

167
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,000
don't I don't have an Apple device

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,380
um

169
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,360
okay

170
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
so the next the next offering is an

171
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,880
electrowear key demon

172
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,620
and so this one is a key logger so you

173
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,960
can for this one they have two different

174
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,759
styles one of them is

175
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,880
um is an extension cable and how I would

176
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,220
picture that one is you would

177
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,380
come into somebody's office somehow

178
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,280
maybe have a reason to have a

179
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,840
mem

180
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,639
some kind of meeting with them and they

181
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
could put this cable on the back of from

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,220
your keyboard to the back of your

183
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,099
computer it's a long extension cable but

184
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:02,759
it's it's an a to a like a receptacle to

185
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,680
a cable

186
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,800
it comes already pre-programmed so you

187
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,680
have all of the stuff already embedded

188
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,840
in so it's really easy to deploy it's

189
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,340
not as expensive to use the one that's

190
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,740
long you have to actually

191
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,900
it it doesn't have the long one doesn't

192
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,120
have any Wi-Fi so you have to actually

193
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,340
come back and get the cable once you

194
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,259
deploy it so that's kind of a challenge

195
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,319
there but but they also have a Wi-Fi

196
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,360
version

197
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,179
which is a smaller

198
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:40,020
dongle that I'll show you right now here

199
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,539
so this is the electro wear version so

200
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,600
they have this nice this long cable that

201
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,160
you know maybe you would notice right so

202
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,440
this is not this would be attached to

203
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,740
your already to your USB cable and then

204
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,240
just run all the way to your computer

205
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,640
and then they created this smaller one

206
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,120
that also has Wi-Fi that is just this so

207
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,040
if you see one of those see they're kind

208
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,480
of suspicious they hang out there they

209
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,760
are just this little this is an a to a

210
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,160
adapter it's not doing anything so let's

211
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,000
be kind of questionable I think

212
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,120
thank you

213
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,839
so another cable is a USB Ninja

214
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,500
so these these cables you change them

215
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,560
into programming mode using a magnet and

216
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,720
then you program them using the Arduino

217
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,220
interface

218
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,180
and so they they're like a medium range

219
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,940
in cost so they cost a hundred dollars

220
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,279
and that's actually the cable that I

221
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,420
have here this is the this is the um

222
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,420
this is the USB Ninja

223
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,320
um

224
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,080
so what happens to this is that you plug

225
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,940
this in and now

226
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,420
you need a Bluetooth connection and you

227
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,240
Bluetooth in and say okay I want to

228
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,100
inject the attack right now

229
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,140
so this is a delayed deployment which is

230
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,000
really interesting to me

231
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,600
um so they um they could they have their

232
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,459
own app that you can download but if

233
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:09,899
you're kind of suspicious of maybe their

234
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,300
app then they also have a hardware thing

235
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,279
where you can just push a button and

236
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,000
it'll go through

237
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,279
so this is my USB ninja which comes in

238
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,519
white

239
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,860
all right so the next the next thing now

240
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,680
this is not really a cable so we call it

241
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,380
the USB Samurai

242
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,660
um you have a Logitech dongle that a lot

243
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,000
of people have where they have their

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,180
keyboards and their my salt to on this

245
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,820
little Bluetooth dongle here and so you

246
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,180
can take that dongle you break it apart

247
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,000
it's cheap you break it apart then they

248
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,300
have new code that you can reprogram it

249
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,760
and then you have to somehow build your

250
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,180
own cable from it you have to you know

251
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,640
buy these little adapter things and and

252
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,720
build the cable or or an adapter

253
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,240
and then you can get an attack that's

254
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,480
very similar to the USB ducky in a

255
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,019
different medium

256
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,459
so this is my my attempt at this very

257
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,440
exciting thing where okay I broke this

258
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,220
this Logitech device and I broke it

259
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,740
apart and of course I I had a hard time

260
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,140
you know feeding this you know Atlant I

261
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,060
programmed it had a hard time feeding

262
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,839
the the USB into

263
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,680
into some housing that made sense so

264
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,660
this was a little bit of a failure on my

265
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,880
part but I'm very persistent so I will I

266
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,980
will get this one but I I don't quite

267
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,360
have this one together yet

268
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,899
so um the next offering is demon seed

269
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,000
EDU

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,940
so the person that made the OMG cables

271
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,339
he came up with this demon seed edu

272
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,839
which a bunch of

273
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,220
um

274
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,200
it's a kit and uh and what you have is

275
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,260
you can assemble the programming jig and

276
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,220
then you assemble the implant and then

277
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,940
um

278
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,399
they have this YouTube video series

279
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,320
where you can watch the series and it

280
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,760
tells you step by step how to build

281
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,680
these things

282
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,720
um they're not

283
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,120
um the same as the OMG cable so the mg

284
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,440
cable is like

285
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,660
more like a hub you know where it

286
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,040
actually

287
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,500
behaves as a USB cable so it's kind of

288
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,720
hidden from from the user they can use

289
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,660
the cable as normal because it's like a

290
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,399
hub it has multiple

291
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,139
um

292
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:51,300
operations these demon seeds don't so

293
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,720
once you put the once you put the

294
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,339
compromise Cable in it's like that cable

295
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,700
does not work so it it

296
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,339
maybe could be figured out in that well

297
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,700
I have a broken USB cable but also you

298
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,860
can they are sniffing data so they're

299
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,680
just it's just a you know I want to see

300
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,480
you know what's happening on that USB

301
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,680
line so that's what they're doing

302
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,260
so one thing that was really interesting

303
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,700
as I was going through this project I'm

304
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,380
looking for all these bad cables because

305
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,740
I want to compare them right and so uh I

306
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,779
I found that that one of the the

307
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,000
offerings came up and said oh watch out

308
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,860
for our counterfeit you know you must

309
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,560
you know measure it correctly and it's

310
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,839
this this is you know counterfeits don't

311
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,019
have our small size uh and I thought

312
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,779
that was pretty funny because uh I know

313
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,880
that there must be counterfeits out

314
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,339
there at this point just because the

315
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,680
people are complaining about them but um

316
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,500
I didn't have any so I I'm not going to

317
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,320
uh to have those in my in my talk but I

318
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,000
just wanted to bring it up that people

319
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,800
are counterfeiting them so there might

320
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,200
have there might be some that maybe have

321
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,860
different qualities to them

322
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,920
so here's my eye test of the day

323
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,639
um

324
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,440
I really like this table doll so I

325
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,959
really wanted to to put it in

326
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,820
um it's important you know an

327
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,920
opportunity for you to look at the

328
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,160
different cables that are available and

329
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,980
what the different things that they can

330
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,560
do are so the first uh these are all in

331
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,240
order of the way that I presented them

332
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,100
so I started with the OMG cables and

333
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,200
then I moved to the electorware and then

334
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,839
ninja samurai and Demon seeds so you

335
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,060
know the top are our cables the samurai

336
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,579
D Miss seeds are not actually cables but

337
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,359
they're in this anyway

338
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,920
um so on the color when you look down

339
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,480
the color

340
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,320
um

341
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,540
the color of these cables are black and

342
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,560
white on OMG the color of the electro

343
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,560
wear are black and white the ninja cable

344
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,860
is only in white and so one thing that I

345
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,019
think is you should just get yourself a

346
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,279
different color okay

347
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,160
because I think everybody could be

348
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,079
compromised by this

349
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,699
so you know get a different color cable

350
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:12,600
because

351
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,060
so they can go out and buy these you

352
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,620
know and they're going to Target you

353
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,380
know the big you know most people have

354
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,600
black and white but if you have a

355
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,000
different color now they're gonna have

356
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,820
to make a color make this just for you

357
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,519
which is they probably will do but it'll

358
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,680
take them longer so

359
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,120
you know

360
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,279
I like to have different colored cables

361
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,500
that means that they open up their

362
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,660
little Arsenal bag you know and they're

363
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,699
like shoot I don't have a match so I

364
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,000
like that

365
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,600
um okay the

366
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,779
next thing is the current so uh each

367
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,060
each of these have a

368
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,920
have a little bit of current draw and I

369
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,300
noticed it's like this is actually

370
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,000
significant this this is you know this

371
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,620
is not like they're trying to hide

372
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,839
they're not trying to hide yet because

373
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,839
nobody really is looking at them very

374
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,180
closely but I'm thinking as a I'm a

375
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,240
Defender you know I'm a builder I look

376
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,040
at this and say you screwed up you know

377
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,320
look at this you got 60 milliamps of

378
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,940
current I mean like people aren't going

379
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,940
to see that well they don't so

380
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,380
I built a current sensor to just you

381
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,540
know pick up the fact that okay I've got

382
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,699
a bad cable suit I can't see it because

383
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,279
the cables just look like every other

384
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,260
cable I mean there's there's no way to

385
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,720
actually look inside it without breaking

386
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,740
it open

387
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,860
but but I can see this current and I

388
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,339
like that signal so uh

389
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,699
I I'm targeting that column

390
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,380
and then the cost

391
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,660
so this is um you know something people

392
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,120
talk about all the time like well you

393
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,220
know How likely is it that someone's

394
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,220
going to spend you know 55 on attacking

395
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,199
me probably they would you know I think

396
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,600
they would you know but you know would

397
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,179
they spend 180 they might you know I

398
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:07,500
might be that good

399
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,000
they might want to spend that money on

400
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,760
me so I don't think the cost is

401
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,679
necessarily something that is going to

402
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,380
stop somebody I really don't I mean I

403
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,380
bought these cables and who am I right

404
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,000
so

405
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,900
um

406
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,599
another note just at the bottom is that

407
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,819
you know the reason why I say it's about

408
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,740
two hundred dollars for the OMG cable

409
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,840
it's because there's this extra cost

410
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,340
Adder for the programmer you have to buy

411
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,440
a special programmer to get it to to

412
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,179
work and that's that's kind of built in

413
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,919
but you know you could buy multiple

414
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,559
cables and use them so

415
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,340
all right so

416
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,240
um

417
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,419
there's a list of benign cables

418
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,480
um

419
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,760
the first one is Led cables those are

420
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,220
four to six milliamps so I don't want

421
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,220
the the hardware solution to say that

422
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,220
this is a a bad cable it's not it's four

423
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,860
to six milliamps on LEDs we've got a

424
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,299
these other cables that you can like

425
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,520
change the end on and and they have

426
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,020
magnet cinnamon you can just change it

427
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,720
from USBC to you know you uh to

428
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,940
lightning cable or whatever so they have

429
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,700
those they have these really long cables

430
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,940
like I I'm uh an I.T person and I want

431
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,380
to connect to a printer across the room

432
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,460
and it's got active uh boosting signal

433
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,539
stuff in those

434
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:34,080
and then you have the um

435
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,020
the power delivery cables so those are

436
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,440
like 100 watt power delivery that could

437
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,600
deliver power to your laptop that can

438
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,080
deliver power to your high-end tablets

439
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,140
uh so they they have active circuitry in

440
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,059
there it's one milliamp of current that

441
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,460
goes to support that and certainly you

442
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,500
don't want to you know sometimes people

443
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,480
say oh well just put high voltage on

444
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,039
your cables to find out well you don't

445
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,660
want to break these nice you know

446
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,980
expensive

447
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,460
um cables for power delivery

448
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,940
okay so I made a hard Hardware design

449
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,000
and uh it wanted to make it open source

450
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,120
anybody can use it limit the amount of

451
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,580
soldering and I want to catch all the

452
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,580
known Hardware implants support all of

453
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,580
the USB cables and because I'm Hardware

454
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,320
I like to fight Hardware with Hardware

455
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,299
so I didn't look at the software

456
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,660
solution

457
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,419
so given that I have created a design to

458
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:34,380
uncover

459
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,419
the malicious cables that has four

460
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,760
separate blocks so you got a power block

461
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,760
up at the top that just runs off a nine

462
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,940
volt battery it transfers that to five

463
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,380
volts with a 7805 then you have your USB

464
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,760
it has a whole bunch of connectors

465
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,220
because you don't know what connectors

466
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,620
you're going to need so I used all like

467
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,919
USB a and USB C that you can plug in all

468
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,559
of these and then you have a current

469
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,100
sensor which I got from

470
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,640
uh spark fund just it's got a share and

471
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,760
share like license open source and then

472
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,840
it goes into uh driver and drives these

473
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,220
red LEDs

474
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,020
that light up when it's malicious

475
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,820
so

476
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,220
um if you were to go through the design

477
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,500
where okay I have the 100 watt power

478
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,020
cable you know I would plug that plug it

479
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,380
into here the power delivery will show a

480
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,720
one milliamp and then I get a voltage

481
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,539
out which is that signal out and then

482
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,419
that would not light any LEDs because

483
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,059
it's not malicious and similarly with

484
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:48,660
the OMG then it would light many LEDs

485
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,000
because it's got 60 milliamps so the

486
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,200
signal would be much bigger

487
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,840
foreign

488
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,640
so um one of the issues with the current

489
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,140
sensors

490
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,140
is that the

491
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,900
the supply and stuff I I started with

492
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,840
this uh this other sensor Uh current

493
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,500
sensor it's a classical current sensor

494
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,080
um and I liked it but when I came to do

495
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,000
the project they retired it and so I

496
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,880
couldn't use it so I moved I moved over

497
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,220
to this to trying to think of what other

498
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,020
things I could possibly do and I go well

499
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,480
they can retire things at any time how

500
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,640
frustrating I'll just do a reference

501
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,659
design because then they'll probably

502
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,760
keep it but I went to the reference

503
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,340
design and you know the qualifier was

504
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,260
you just had to get their parts in order

505
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,640
to use it and of course their parts

506
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,299
weren't available so I went back to

507
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:44,460
SparkFun and I ended up with a hull

508
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,919
effect sensor

509
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,780
so um

510
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,360
this is what the total cost of the

511
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,080
solution is

512
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,860
I'm including the breadboard because I

513
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,419
don't assume you have one

514
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,460
um so you just you have the breakout

515
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,679
boards you have the the current sensor

516
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,780
which is unfortunately a little more

517
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,840
expensive than the one I had originally

518
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,419
and the power Delivery Systems and

519
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,760
really the only thing you have to solder

520
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,120
in order to do this project is the the

521
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,919
headers so you just have a little hat

522
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,700
for your sensor

523
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,240
foreign

524
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,760
that says when it is uh when it's active

525
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,100
and then um in this particular case you

526
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,240
the USB uh board is down here so I I

527
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,580
plug in uh um that demon seed one and

528
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,940
then up in the top right is where you

529
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,120
have the driver a little bit below and

530
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,860
then at the very top right you will see

531
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,320
the LEDs

532
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,179
so the first

533
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,340
the first

534
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,880
solution when you plug in the

535
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,700
design should

536
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,580
light the LED

537
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,200
it's very difficult for me to tell if

538
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,580
this is running so that's kind of

539
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,000
interesting

540
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,480
see if I can fast forward this video

541
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,059
because I'm getting a Time

542
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,380
crunch but I wanted to show you

543
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,620
something

544
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,059
shoot okay

545
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,919
I'll just move to results so um

546
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,120
so I have 130 cables that I uh tested

547
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,120
with this design and I only had one

548
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,640
false negative which is that USB Samurai

549
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,799
which was not working

550
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,720
um I couldn't get that the compromise to

551
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,780
to happen but I show it as a negative

552
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,080
so out of nine malicious cables I was

553
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,940
able to trap eight

554
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,000
um

555
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,620
so a couple of considerations is that

556
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,659
those long active cables that I talked

557
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,220
about where you go across the room

558
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,260
that's like 26 milliamps and I don't

559
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,960
catch those it's only designed for room

560
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,700
temperature and because I moved to a

561
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,100
hall effect sensor and now orientation

562
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,039
is a problem and also the magnetic field

563
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,559
of those magnetic ones you have to take

564
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,600
yes it'd be five inches away which is

565
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,360
fine because the board can move uh

566
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,919
further away but I just wanted to

567
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,440
mention

568
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,880
and so

569
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,440
I think that's about it I wanted to

570
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,900
expand the temperature range support

571
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,460
because it has resistors in there and it

572
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,880
changes the design on

573
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,400
wide temperatures but it always works in

574
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,220
an office environment so that's fine

575
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,360
um

576
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,000
but basically I wanted to

577
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,740
let you know that

578
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,840
USB cables are not always safe

579
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,159
it's great to be at besides porcelain

580
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,310
and this is my first presentation here

581
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:11,260
[Applause]

582
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,720
I hear that there's a few minutes if

583
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,440
anybody has questions

584
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,620
okay

585
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,600
I don't know that's all so

586
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,419
yeah cool that's cool I haven't thought

587
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,220
of that nice

588
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,980
yeah I don't like that sensor because

589
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,919
um because it because of the orientation

590
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,419
problem really

591
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,580
um but it is very accurate so I like

592
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,820
that

593
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,640
are you finding that the malicious

594
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,260
components are being included on the

595
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,140
dies for the uh

596
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,140
he is like a circuit forward to

597
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,059
themselves where are they being like

598
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:09,000
added on and uh kind of like the way

599
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,140
that

600
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,520
micro USB components

601
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,360
on top of the board but you know

602
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,880
so the um the USBs he's asking is that

603
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,779
is that put into the die or is that a

604
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:28,440
board that is made and put into the um

605
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,960
into the USB and what I've seen is it's

606
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,340
a board and made and put into the USB

607
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,960
also I just want to mention that this

608
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,760
the Electoral where people they also

609
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,260
have a keyboard you could buy the

610
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,419
keyboard with it just embed it without a

611
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:45,000
cable just embedded inside the keyboard

612
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,159
itself and then that's like the IBM

613
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,360
typewriter example right so

614
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,700
any other questions

615
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,640
oh I have a wave way in the back I hope

616
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,480
I can hear you so

617
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,120
uh

618
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,658
um

619
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:11,039
these are being sold through mainstream

620
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,840
channels you can get them at hack five

621
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,900
if that's mainstream enough

622
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,900
hard work hacker Warehouse as well has

623
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,500
them and then the other ones I had to go

624
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,620
off of other sides to get

625
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,000
uh

626
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,720
good question

627
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,440
all right oh one more do you have any

628
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,539
thought to malicious USB charging

629
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,279
station say like at an airport or

630
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:41,100
something like that yeah

631
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,679
um so he asked uh what about using USB

632
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,320
charging stations um

633
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,700
yeah uh those could be a problem and I

634
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,799
don't use them for that reason it's like

635
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,539
I'm always thinking someone's trying to

636
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,220
attack me so

637
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,890
anyway thank you

638
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:04,979
[Applause]
