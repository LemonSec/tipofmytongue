1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,400
so my name is Ben Kendall and this is my

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,379
presentation about breaking into infosec

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,460
or how I hacked my way out of poverty

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,440
uh so a little bit about my I'm an

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,059
associate Security consultant at NCC

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,400
group I'm a former journalist a former

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,460
filmmaker and former wage worker so I've

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,560
done all kinds of different kinds of

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,560
wage work like I was a janitor and I've

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,939
made several different kinds of pizzas

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,040
in sandwiches and coffee and I've I've

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,520
dug trenches and made roads and all

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,120
kinds of stuff so it's kind of the wages

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,820
of ADHD I suppose

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,800
and I had no formal I.T experience so

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,879
back in 2016 I had a life change

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,640
and I was kind of the guy on the couch

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,559
with my friends

19
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,920
um but kind of all over Oregon and

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,699
um

21
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,860
that will come in later in the story but

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,339
uh to suffice to say it's not fun

23
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:08,539
especially doing that for several years

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,619
so let's talk about a little bit about

25
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,619
where I work uh NCC group it's the

26
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,540
largest penetration testing consultancy

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,060
firm in the world and it's a fantastic

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,920
place to work everybody is very

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,000
knowledgeable

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,659
um and just fantastic bunch of infosec

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,100
people

32
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,040
um a little a little claims to fame uh

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,619
the the CSO exploited the first buffer

34
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,119
overflow

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,100
um the chief scientists also created the

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,799
the time delay SQL injection

37
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,280
and Patrick has passed the hash excuse

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,439
me was discovered by next NCC employees

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,520
so

40
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,340
um coming into their

41
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,680
uh it's pretty intimidating to be honest

42
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,560
so let's talk about

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,640
me being poor

44
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,360
and trying to get into infosec so the

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,579
way I wanted to run this talk is

46
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,320
I wanted to

47
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,060
give somebody that's trying to do the

48
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,919
same thing that I did some actionable

49
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,819
advice because uh perhaps

50
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,220
my situation was an outlier so

51
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,360
um I'm going to go through kind of what

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,739
I went through and see if it applies

53
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,680
so I do pen testing I'm part of the the

54
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,220
offensive part of cyber security so uh

55
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,080
I'm a hacker for hire I break into stuff

56
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,900
for money and it's a lot of fun

57
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,060
um that's not only what I do I also do

58
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,180
some uh some consultancy about policy

59
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,620
and stuff like that

60
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,120
um that stuff's interesting but what

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,220
really gets me going is breaking into

62
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,720
stuff

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,019
um for instance the other day I had a

64
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,540
very successful engagement and I owned

65
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,300
their Network rightly as you could say

66
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,540
and when it happened

67
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,140
um

68
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,060
I had so much adrenaline hit my heart

69
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,640
and I was shaking for two hours no other

70
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,120
job in my life has done that actually I

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
feel like that when I had to go to work

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,580
the last thing I want to do is uh go

73
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,700
take care of uh Karen and Ken screaming

74
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,620
at me about why their latte is too cold

75
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,140
or too hot or whatever

76
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,180
so

77
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,879
say you want to break into infosec what

78
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,400
do you need to know well programming's

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,500
like number one in my opinion these

80
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,659
these these opinions will will differ

81
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,940
from other people but I think that just

82
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,239
kind of having a good a good hold on a

83
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,280
scripting language like python it's an

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
excellent way to start some basic

85
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,720
Network networking knowledge because it

86
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,280
comes into play all the time especially

87
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,620
for what I do

88
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,700
you're going to need to know the command

89
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,840
line you're going to need to have

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,060
familiarity with basic pen testing tools

91
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,420
like stuff like Metasploit or msf Venom

92
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,340
or burp Suite SQL map stuff like that

93
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,900
Hardware Basics like it's probably best

94
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,760
that you build your own computer it's

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,620
just more secure that way A and B it's

96
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,560
fun hopefully that you'll you'll get the

97
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,959
opportunity to do that if you haven't

98
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,299
the fundamentals in Computing stuff like

99
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,899
memory addresses how CPUs work

100
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,160
um and there's so much more in fact

101
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,280
there's an endless amount uh the uh

102
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,560
during my time as a journalist it was

103
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,400
the very end of my University career

104
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,060
doing that and I was walking around OSU

105
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,680
and it was this big uh it was a

106
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,820
an incubator for for startups and it was

107
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,860
all science and health related and they

108
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,620
had a whole bunch of just giant cool

109
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,900
science stuff like like liquid nitrogen

110
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,000
and tanks that were cooling something

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,160
that I had no idea what it was and and I

112
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,900
was looking around me and I thought

113
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,720
 I think I picked the wrong career

114
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,139
this is way cooler than what I do I love

115
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,740
journalism and it does serve a purpose

116
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,940
it's the fourth estate's very important

117
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,960
however

118
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,580
uh

119
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,580
it's kind of shallow it's very broad but

120
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,340
very shallow whereas technology is Broad

121
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,699
and deep you can just fall into a rabbit

122
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,979
hole and never come out and that's

123
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,419
actually what's so fascinating about it

124
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,780
to me

125
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,160
so

126
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,800
when I first started learning python

127
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,199
actually I really liked creating stuff

128
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,259
and I thought well maybe I can be a Dev

129
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:35,759
and so I started trying to figure that

130
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,979
out and it came to me that like oh God

131
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,419
like it's

132
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,820
it's almost impossible to get work as a

133
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,320
Dev even if you've got like a GitHub

134
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,340
repo it's uh you need something more

135
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,800
tangible uh to at least get in front of

136
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,860
somebody so I went out and got some pen

137
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,900
testing certs so I started with the uh

138
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,080
the ejbt and I went on to the ecppt that

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,360
was with um e-learn security their INE

140
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,160
now and both of them were very good and

141
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,800
then there's the oscp which I bought the

142
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,759
course for

143
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,620
um and still have to take tests but

144
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,060
[Music]

145
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,900
um

146
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,060
again

147
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,680
but uh

148
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,039
it's it's in my opinion I I liked the

149
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,160
ecppt better it was uh

150
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,560
it was just more instructive

151
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,060
um it just depends on your learning

152
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,500
style though they're both great

153
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,819
so

154
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,080
when you're doing Ole Miss when you're

155
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,660
really poor uh it's kind of difficult to

156
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,060
find time or space especially when you

157
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,759
don't have much space and you're

158
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,100
probably a wage worker and you're doing

159
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,639
stuff for minimum wage so uh that's

160
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,139
usually part time as well because they

161
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,000
don't want to pay your benefits

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,639
so you're getting these weird hours like

163
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,280
like clopins like you'll close one night

164
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,479
and then you open the next morning

165
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,340
brutal

166
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,500
um so having any kind of energy to do

167
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,160
pretty intense study especially if

168
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,380
you're not familiar with the with the

169
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,880
subject matter that you're working with

170
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,979
it can be brutal

171
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,840
um so it's going to take a lot of time

172
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,020
uh and it's you you've got to understand

173
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,940
that it's might take longer than you

174
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,000
think and it's has nothing to do with

175
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,099
you uh it's just your kind of your

176
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,560
situation is going to affect the way

177
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,819
you're you're apprehending this

178
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,259
information so

179
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,780
um remember that just various sources

180
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,759
like if I didn't get something from a

181
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,139
course I would go read a book if I

182
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:35,400
didn't get it from the book I would give

183
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,740
watch a video on it or just walk or read

184
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,740
a blog post or do something that to

185
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,139
somehow take that information in and

186
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,660
make it more tangible to you

187
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,440
um and so when you get burnt out

188
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,400
sometimes you just don't want to look at

189
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,400
any technology at all you're just like

190
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,080
I don't want to read any more code I

191
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,400
mean I love it but I just I've been

192
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,919
doing this for 12 14 hours a day for

193
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,900
several months and I'm just kind of over

194
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,740
it

195
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,919
I would just like to relax instead like

196
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,419
you can listen to a podcast like dark

197
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,660
neck Diaries like it's just kind of

198
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,460
fun entertainment but it's still within

199
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,479
the realm and you're still kind of

200
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,720
educating yourself in an oblique way and

201
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,240
so and it's it's still fun I mean it's

202
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,639
it's supposed to be fun at least the

203
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,440
offensive side it's fun hacking is fun

204
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,539
so we got to remember while we're doing

205
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,719
this

206
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,860
so

207
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,900
um after I got my certs

208
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,599
um I was helping people uh to get theirs

209
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,700
I would coach them through techniques

210
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,039
problems that they were having

211
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,440
um one of the things that I notice is a

212
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,000
lot of people were having problems

213
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,740
getting in front of people for new

214
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,180
interviews

215
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,459
um and they it's because they did they

216
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,620
just didn't stand out very much

217
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,420
um like they don't

218
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,240
um they don't share their work and so no

219
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,180
one can tell if they're actually full of

220
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,680
it or if they know what they're talking

221
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,440
about so one thing that you can do is

222
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,899
stand to stand out is to share your work

223
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,660
online somehow I would highly recommend

224
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,399
the book steal this uh steal like an

225
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,339
artist by Austin Cleon and his other two

226
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:12,720
books I can't remember the middle one

227
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,060
but the last one was show your work

228
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,040
um so the middle one's about like when

229
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,140
things get really difficult and uh

230
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,019
hacking is art

231
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,959
we're very creative people we have to be

232
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,519
we have to find a different way in

233
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,080
somehow

234
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,680
um

235
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,839
it's it's part of the game and that's

236
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,600
what's so exciting about it

237
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,180
so you can start a blog that's what I

238
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,920
did uh I was falling back on my

239
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,300
journalism skills when I did that or

240
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,800
like a YouTube channel if you're more

241
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,420
into production

242
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,880
um definitely compete in CTF events like

243
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,580
maybe your place and people that you'll

244
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,140
get your name out there that way bug

245
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,700
bounties are good like if you've got a

246
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,620
bug bounty to your name uh usually

247
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,540
that's something to recur about you

248
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,800
would you would call and not call out

249
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,500
and say oh I got this bounty on I don't

250
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,380
know X company and got 500 bucks or more

251
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,839
or less but it doesn't it like the money

252
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,600
is great but really it's it's the trophy

253
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,420
that's part of it at least for me

254
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,800
um I haven't gotten any bug bounties

255
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,620
myself the trophies for mayor are

256
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,660
getting fruit or domain admin something

257
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,100
like that

258
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,760
um so also I got hired at NCC this is my

259
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,220
first infosec gig and I got hired from

260
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,820
LinkedIn and it was uh sight unseen it

261
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,140
just kind of came out of the blue which

262
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,820
was fantastic I had applied to many

263
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,580
places before and usually it's thank you

264
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,260
but no thank you

265
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,420
um uh because of course I don't have any

266
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,399
requisite experience

267
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,480
um

268
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,820
have a GitHub repository if you know how

269
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,920
to code it's interesting to me that a

270
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,019
lot of pen testers some of them just

271
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,480
don't know how to code not necessarily I

272
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,640
haven't met them in NCC but I've met

273
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,500
them at other places and there's no

274
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,839
judgment there but I think that it's

275
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,440
it's I can't heartbrone it enough you

276
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,019
definitely need to know especially if

277
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,300
you're using an exploit like that you

278
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,920
pulled off the internet you need to go

279
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,880
through that code and make sure it's

280
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,540
safe because you don't want to drop some

281
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,060
making exploit onto the uh onto a

282
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,980
client's Network and then it owns their

283
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,959
Network and you didn't do it but you did

284
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,540
do it if you know what I mean

285
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,940
so contributing to open source projects

286
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,180
that's a standard Dev advice right but

287
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,579
it's there's still lots of development

288
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,519
and tools that's in hacking tools that

289
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,500
we're using all the time and or you can

290
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,420
just make your own because there's

291
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,180
always a need for something you might

292
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,500
not know what it is but eventually

293
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,000
you'll find something you're like oh I

294
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,360
wish I could do X and I can't I have to

295
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,220
do it this long way I'll automate it

296
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,440
figure it out

297
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,680
and definitely help others the best way

298
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,980
to learn something is to teach it and so

299
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,019
when someone asks me oh like I can't do

300
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,079
uh what is this I can't do something I

301
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,880
can't I can't come up with a scenario

302
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,540
and but you if you research that and and

303
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,399
then you find out the the answer to

304
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,839
their their problem then you too have uh

305
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,700
shepherded this person forward in their

306
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,560
knowledge but also you've improved your

307
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,540
own and that's fantastic

308
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,720
so I started learning

309
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,540
I started learning python in 2018 and

310
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,360
then I started doing aiming at infosec

311
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,720
stuff in 2020 I ended up getting uh an

312
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,920
interview to be a um

313
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,959
uh a teacher's aide for some infosec

314
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,540
some infosec Boot Camp or something like

315
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,700
that and I I thought oh wait a minute

316
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,399
this is a possibility well maybe I'll

317
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,360
just dive in and do infosec instead

318
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,700
and it's going to take a while I mean

319
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,480
courses take a while uh it's learning

320
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,459
all this information it's going to take

321
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,579
you some time and it's going to probably

322
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,579
take you some time to pass the test and

323
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:03,720
it's probably going to take you some

324
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,959
time to get a job and the the tales that

325
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,700
you hear on the internet there's like oh

326
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,440
well I passed the oscp after only

327
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,940
studying for a month and I have no

328
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,860
experience and then I got a job right

329
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,839
away and I'm just like um

330
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,000
did you though

331
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
I don't believe you

332
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,540
I mean if they did awesome that's great

333
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,700
but those people are definitely outliers

334
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,680
like they're not the bell curve like

335
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,720
they're like on either side of it

336
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,700
they're not in the middle uh probably in

337
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,959
the middle you're probably gonna wait at

338
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,060
least six months or if not longer and

339
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,560
that's okay it'll just give you more

340
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,320
time to uh to level up and in the

341
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,579
meantime unfortunately you'll have to

342
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,160
work your job that you dislike

343
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,320
or maybe you don't like it or maybe you

344
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,639
do like it you're just wanting to change

345
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,360
so

346
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,440
so how did I do this

347
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,639
um like I said it I I kind of leaned on

348
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,139
my friends

349
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,500
um and I was lucky enough to have that

350
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,339
opportunity I know that if I were to

351
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,240
slave away on uh like a barista position

352
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,399
for minimum wage or minimum in the Metro

353
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,519
whatever it will be very difficult to

354
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:20,100
survive and also to do study and add on

355
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,100
to that maybe this person has a kid I do

356
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,260
not but in this hypothetical scenario

357
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,959
perhaps they do that's even less time

358
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,700
and less energy and you're already

359
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,880
exhausted wage work is very difficult

360
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,600
it's grueling and it's taxing physically

361
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,300
and emotionally mentally it's it's not

362
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,180
ideal especially to survive off of

363
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,160
that's that's your main means of

364
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,199
survival it's really difficult

365
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,380
so uh here are some resources uh I'll

366
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,079
also be putting this up on my blog here

367
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,940
at the uh eventually here in the next

368
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,079
couple of days so you can check it out

369
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,880
there and I'll probably be spreading it

370
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,260
out as well hacking the art of

371
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,660
exploitation that book is from 2008 so

372
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,060
pretty old considering but it's still

373
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,100
great for buffer overflows

374
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,680
um it's I highly recommend it for that

375
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,139
the operator handbook's got like a tons

376
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,579
of really cool commands that you can

377
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,019
just kind of flip through and find out

378
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,260
uh stuff you didn't know about whatever

379
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,079
Linux windows and different different

380
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,300
ways to get around things or query for

381
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,820
information all of pretty much all of

382
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,199
those search press they rule

383
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,199
so I'm just going to jump to the courses

384
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,260
uh the the Cyber Mentor uh Heath Adams

385
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,120
his courses are fantastic I actually

386
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,160
took those before I took the agbt or

387
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,899
egpt

388
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,540
I I couldn't love them enough they're

389
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,459
they're just fantastic and I love them

390
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:52,980
uh they definitely got me started so uh

391
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,500
over the wire.org Bandit that was my

392
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,860
first love uh I loved that I loved that

393
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,820
CTF and there's like 30 40 levels or

394
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,079
something like that and it teaches you a

395
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,760
little bit about Linux it's great for

396
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,740
beginners a little bit about Linux and

397
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,779
networking little by little every level

398
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,399
highly recommend it

399
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,040
um hack the Box try hack me all those

400
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,680
are great offsets Proving Grounds I

401
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,240
really like those they're really good to

402
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,519
gear up for the oscp because all those

403
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,579
boxes are made by the oscp folks so

404
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,800
you're going to see similar stuff on the

405
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,120
test

406
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,459
and the pen tester Academy I've tried

407
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,980
them a little bit I don't have too much

408
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,959
experience with it but it's more kind of

409
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,339
CTF

410
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,339
boxes that you can attack and definitely

411
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,180
take advantage of YouTube ipsec epsec

412
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,160
rocks and it's true that's this website

413
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,620
but it's also true that guy is awesome

414
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,360
um John Hammond these are all the guys

415
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,000
that that I watched and when I just

416
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,500
didn't want to look at a screen anymore

417
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,180
I just kind of like would listen to it

418
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,319
sometimes and it was enough

419
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:01,500
so uh let's talk about just getting a

420
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,600
job here in the last couple of minutes

421
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,099
um so I was falling back on my

422
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,839
journalism skills like I said and I

423
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,240
asked Rob Fuller AKA mubix he runs the

424
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,000
red team over at United and asked him a

425
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,020
couple of questions because I just

426
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,220
didn't want to come at you with my

427
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,339
experience and so I asked him what the

428
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,199
common issue facing unsuccessful

429
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,079
candidates uh was because like I mean

430
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,339
naturally there's going to be more

431
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,500
unsuccessful candidates than successful

432
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,939
right there's only one person that

433
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,799
they're going to hire or a few maybe if

434
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,080
you're lucky but he says like lack of

435
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,640
maturity empathy and drive are common

436
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,940
themes among the candidates and uh if if

437
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,700
the the damage is done it's it's pretty

438
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,059
bad it's this huge trust or sorry

439
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,440
there's a there's a lot of trust that's

440
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,840
inherent in what we do

441
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,820
um so and I also asked him some advice

442
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,200
this one hit me hard actually dropped

443
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,000
the Imposter syndrome

444
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,100
um he wasn't talking to me specifically

445
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,500
but like I I was really happy that he

446
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,080
said that because I totally have that

447
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,600
foreign

448
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,100
everybody I work with is brilliant and

449
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,820
talented and it's shocking to to come in

450
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,039
and just like oh man I have no idea what

451
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,160
uh what this colleague said um and it's

452
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,500
uh but that happens to all of us

453
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,020
everyone has that experience so it's not

454
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,340
just me uh it's not just you

455
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,580
um so Tyler Russ she is uh the one of

456
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,179
the HR people at NCC she hired me she's

457
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:28,640
fantastic

458
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,039
she was quite the champion for me and uh

459
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,400
so she's basically said uh kind of

460
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,500
roughly the same things that I did you

461
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,120
need to have something to show your work

462
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,240
if you're if you're in academics so um

463
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,799
something that you did for like a

464
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,660
project or like a club that you were

465
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,120
running so on and so forth and soft

466
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,860
skills are very important for both

467
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,260
people that are in academics and not

468
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,559
um and for Tyler she also mentions that

469
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,380
uh that's kind of what uh that's often

470
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,600
what peop what gets people

471
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,520
um out of consideration is they have no

472
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,880
soft skills and uh roughly that's what

473
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,280
Rob Fuller was saying as well if you if

474
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,620
you can't speak to people kindly and

475
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,480
respectfully there's no way you're going

476
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,440
to be able to speak to a client

477
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,480
especially if you just own their Network

478
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,260
and they're irritated you need to fall

479
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,360
back on those customer service skills as

480
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,640
retail skills and diffuse that situation

481
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,440
because you want them to come back these

482
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,419
people have paid a lot of money for you

483
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,120
to show up and if you show up and wreck

484
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,860
their Network and then you're just like

485
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,620
whatever that's you're probably gonna

486
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,840
get fired or at least talk to and

487
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,100
they're gonna lose that client and

488
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,520
that's it is a great deal of money so uh

489
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,100
something to think about so uh

490
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,780
unfortunately it's not the tldr but it

491
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,000
kind of is just for the end so you need

492
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,500
a good Baseline of knowledge you're

493
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,419
never going to stop learning you need to

494
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:52,919
stand out and you need to help others

495
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,840
and you've got to remember those

496
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,980
expectations

497
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,460
it's there's there's no reason that you

498
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,900
should stop

499
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,419
don't stop not stopping don't quit

500
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,280
that's all thank you

501
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,280
questions

502
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,039
it's gentleman in the back

503
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,460
uh unfortunately currently we're in a

504
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,039
hiring freeze but hopefully we'll be

505
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,880
getting to start hiring again soon

506
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,480
yes

507
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,520
what kind of labs and stuff did I set up

508
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,080
in home

509
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,179
um I you like to use virtualbox and I'll

510
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,900
just you set up a Virtual Lab because

511
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,340
again going back to like I was quite

512
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,260
poor right so I had like a middle of the

513
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,900
road laptop for 2017.

514
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,640
um and I would just set up a virtual

515
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,020
Network on that I just threw as much

516
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,480
memory as I could get into it and to so

517
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,820
I can run as many virtual assistants as

518
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,559
I could run my own virtual Network and

519
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,179
try and pivot from there so on and so

520
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,419
forth practicing techniques usually I'd

521
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,299
throw it together like a couple of

522
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,400
vulnerable boxes maybe one or two that I

523
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,340
made myself that are just crap just just

524
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,500
a practice pivoting because pivoting is

525
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,220
kind of a pain sometimes

526
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,280
yeah for people trying to learn uh

527
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,900
scripting language like you said is

528
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,880
super important how do you recommend

529
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,700
they find ideas for like their own valid

530
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,320
projects that are Beyond just the paint

531
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,059
by numbers tutorials but like a real

532
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,799
idea for like something useful they can

533
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,500
use to demonstrate your skills sure so

534
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,760
um for people that didn't hear it he

535
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,539
asked how do you discover ideas to to

536
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,760
create your own projects that's kind of

537
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,620
a golden question

538
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,220
um

539
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,220
usually the ideas that I have

540
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,260
uh that I've that I've had that I

541
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,880
haven't even acted on as because I've

542
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,640
been so busy but usually you're it's

543
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,620
it's it comes out of it comes out of The

544
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,480
Ether just it comes to you uh because

545
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,059
you have a problem usually it's like oh

546
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,059
God I can't I can't keep doing this

547
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,500
stupid command over and over and over

548
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,640
again I mean that's just like simple

549
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,620
bash scripting right but if it were like

550
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,320
python uh for instance when you're doing

551
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,940
buffer overflows you're reading you're

552
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,919
writing your own your own Python scripts

553
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,500
just to interface with that uh with that

554
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,740
binary and then you you're usually also

555
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,960
exploiting it that way as well

556
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,140
um so uh you can if you're using your

557
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,720
own your own scripts for instance maybe

558
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,100
you found

559
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,559
like maybe you found like an old an old

560
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,539
app that people don't use anymore or

561
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:41,520
maybe they do use it and you decide to

562
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,679
just kind of uh

563
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,080
um reverse engineer it could be one

564
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,419
thing yeah

565
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,360
anything else

566
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,440
just a quick comment thank you for your

567
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,559
talk I appreciate it um uh if you're if

568
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,880
you want to hack on someone else's

569
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,679
computer a lot of these uh Cloud

570
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,500
platform providers will provide you free

571
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,559
credits now without a credit well some

572
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,120
without a credit card but others with

573
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,100
and I would recommend that if you want

574
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,320
to just Tinker around and you don't you

575
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,179
don't have a lab at home that you can

576
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,520
afford that's a good idea yeah they do

577
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,960
give out free credit to students I

578
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,159
believe yeah

579
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:21,200
that's awesome that's a good idea

580
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,000
anything else

581
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,860
right well this was my first talk ever

582
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,640
so thank you for my rambling

583
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,640
[Applause]
