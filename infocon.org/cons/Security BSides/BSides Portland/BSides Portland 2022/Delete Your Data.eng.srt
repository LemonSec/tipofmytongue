1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:04,140
I'm Malcolm I'm a board board member and

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,759
I'm going to be emceeing this first

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,000
section of talks so it's with my uh with

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,679
great pleasure that I introduce Jacob

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,000
with delete your data

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,320
thank you and good morning everybody

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,240
everybody hear me okay

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,760
awesome uh as was stated my name is

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,760
Jacob I'm a recent law graduate out of

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,000
Las Vegas Nevada I am anxiously waiting

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,279
the bar results which come out in four

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,700
hours so if I look nervous later that's

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,260
why

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,500
um I mostly work in data privacy open

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,140
source uh non-profit formation and a

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,340
little bit of alternative dispute

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,920
resolution so if you see me afterwards

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,360
and want to talk about any of that I

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,059
love to talk about all of those I'm also

20
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,340
the backup plan our executive director

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,539
was supposed to be here but she just

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,520
started a brand new job so congrats to

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,879
her she's been at least a few years to

24
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,879
the Portland uh b-sides so she's very

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,299
sad she couldn't make it uh this time

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,340
so what I'm going to talk about today or

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,780
I guess I should go back and talk about

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,340
delete your data generally delete your

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,700
data is a non-profit that is based in

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,140
Las Vegas Nevada but we operate

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,420
throughout the country we do data

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,479
deletion services for

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,799
individuals looking to delete their data

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,200
from different companies websites and

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,460
that sort of thing

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,619
so I'm going to kind of use delete your

37
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,479
data to frame

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,479
the laws surrounding data deletion in

39
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,140
the United States and abroad so how

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,640
we're going to do that is we're going to

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,140
first talk about just how the data

42
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,140
deletion process works and it's not

43
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,460
going to make much sense because it seem

44
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,020
oversimplified so then we're going to go

45
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,400
into the laws that support what we're

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,060
doing

47
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,520
uh and then with that legal framework

48
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,259
we'll be able to revisit how

49
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,140
deleteyourdata.com deletes your data and

50
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,340
then we'll talk a little bit about why

51
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,259
it matters and things moving forward and

52
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,659
how we can support data privacy and data

53
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,659
deletion uh in the future

54
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,360
so how it works is a user reaches out on

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,000
our website uh and then we have a

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,500
scraping service which will scrape their

57
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,780
information

58
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,459
or if they just give us specific account

59
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,680
we can delete those specific accounts

60
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,620
and then we just request the deletions

61
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,120
so like I said if that seems a little

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,680
bit oversimplified it definitely is that

63
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,959
last part uh is where you need the legal

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,160
framework to

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,620
to get a little bit more context

66
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,959
so there's there's multiple laws that

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,660
enforce a right uh of deletion for

68
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,780
personally identifiable information upon

69
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,360
a user's request

70
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,620
in order to really understand this we

71
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,580
got to know what that personal

72
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,220
identifiable information actually is

73
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,040
so what is it it's any information that

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,860
can be used to distinguish or trace an

75
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,920
individual identity some common examples

76
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,680
are names social security number uh the

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,959
date and place of birth uh mother's

78
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,480
maiden name and then also biometric

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,120
records so uh anything that would

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,340
identify that person as

81
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,180
for me it'd be Jacob Jacob Smith uh

82
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,340
so it also includes any information

83
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,560
that's linked to that information that

84
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,940
could also be used to identify that

85
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,159
person so that's really what the data

86
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,019
deletion laws focus on is that personal

87
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,360
identifiable information

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,620
um

89
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,379
so the gdpr which we'll talk about in a

90
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,300
little bit gives some good examples of

91
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,680
what is and what isn't personal

92
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,200
identifiable information at delete your

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,459
data we get

94
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,200
a good amount of requests for that top

95
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,599
stuff so if somebody writes a journal

96
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,239
article about let's say a politician

97
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,900
running for court in Nevada uh you can't

98
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,400
really request that that be deleted

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,440
that's information somebody else wrote

100
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,659
about you but if that person were to

101
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,519
upload a bunch of information on their

102
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,680
social media that can be requested to be

103
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,099
deleted

104
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,599
so what are the big laws that help us

105
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,640
control our data

106
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,220
first we have the gdpr which all of

107
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,379
these have their limitations

108
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,879
um and then there's also the California

109
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,620
consumer Privacy Act uh the CCPA it

110
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,000
operates mostly in California but

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,379
there's also a bunch of other state laws

112
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,519
that do things similar in different

113
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,760
states and then lastly we have just

114
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,440
enforcement of a company's privacy

115
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,978
policies

116
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,000
so the general data protection

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,100
regulation the GPR

118
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,380
um it's the big player in the EU the

119
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,940
European Union

120
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,300
um and it among other things provides a

121
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,860
right to be forgotten

122
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,120
um so that right to be forgotten is a

123
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,860
right to be deleted

124
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,639
um

125
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,759
so although it only applies to EUC uh

126
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,220
citizens a lot of companies will include

127
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,540
in their privacy policies a general

128
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,440
right to the lesion uh that encompasses

129
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,460
both EU citizens and abroad so uh even

130
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,979
if you're not an EU citizen sometimes if

131
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,560
a company is compliant with the gdpr you

132
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,759
can still request your data to be

133
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,500
deleted

134
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,560
uh CCPA is kind of the like first U.S

135
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,600
counterpart to the gdpr

136
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,580
um it's the California consumer Privacy

137
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,800
Act it's really limited uh to who it

138
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,900
applies to so it only applies to

139
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,520
for-profit businesses

140
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,940
that collects uh or uh sell the

141
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,400
information of California residents and

142
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,020
they have to have one of those three so

143
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,180
they have to have either gross annual

144
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,000
revenue of over 25 million

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,979
they have to either buy a receiver sell

146
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,000
the personal information of a certain

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,979
number of California citizens or they

148
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,139
have to derive at least or over 50

149
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,600
percent of their profit from the selling

150
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,240
of data

151
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,600
so yeah the CCPA states that people have

152
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,220
a right to request that a business

153
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,600
delete the personal identifiable

154
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,419
information about the consumer uh which

155
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,680
the business has collected from the

156
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,080
consumer so again that comes from those

157
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,060
requests so the user has to request that

158
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,520
they get their data deleted uh and then

159
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,560
if that company falls under the CCPA

160
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,520
they are required to delete that data

161
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,360
so some other big state laws uh you have

162
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,180
Virginia which is almost identical to

163
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,639
the CCPA except it has different levels

164
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,539
of control for organizations and then

165
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:16,979
you have Colorado Colorado is an

166
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,180
interesting case because it's the first

167
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,100
one to apply to non-profits as well as

168
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
for-profit businesses

169
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,419
so a lot of the people I work with are

170
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,979
nonprofits so they're very concerned

171
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,100
about Colorado Colorado and Virginia I

172
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,380
think both don't start uh

173
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,660
becoming enforceable until 2023 so it's

174
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,860
going to be interesting to see how that

175
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,500
impacts the uh the legal framework

176
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,759
surrounding data deletion

177
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,800
so that gets us to privacy policies so a

178
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,960
lot of companies will have the CCPA or

179
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,819
some other Provisions tied into their

180
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,979
privacy policies

181
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,440
um privacy policies are tied often to

182
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,900
terms of service

183
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,340
and these privacy policies in terms of

184
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,039
service are basically a promise or an

185
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,259
agreement between the company and the

186
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,060
consumer that's visiting the website or

187
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,639
engaging with the product

188
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,360
um and the FTC Act is what allows us to

189
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,780
uh or allows them to enforce these

190
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,940
Provisions within a privacy policy so

191
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,639
the FTC act prohibits unfair or

192
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,800
deceptive Acts or practices in or

193
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,199
affecting Commerce

194
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,520
most of the litigation there surrounding

195
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,000
data privacy has come from the uh

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,419
deceptive acts so that's if the privacy

197
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,220
policy promises something

198
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,800
and the company's not doing that the FTC

199
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,419
can come in and say you're not you're

200
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,919
being deceptive you're lying on your

201
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,099
privacy policy uh we're going to seek

202
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,319
enforcement against you

203
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,380
um

204
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,000
so the big question here that companies

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,160
think of is you know why not just not

206
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,440
include a privacy policy or just make

207
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,720
the privacy policy so confusing that

208
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,900
it's rendered useless uh so a lot of the

209
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,360
state laws like the ccba the Virginia

210
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,919
the VC DPA I think is the uh

211
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,620
acronym for it

212
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,660
they have requirements within them that

213
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,479
the company have a privacy policy that

214
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,800
it be easy to read and that it be easy

215
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,400
to find on on the website

216
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,720
um

217
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,240
so

218
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,940
a big thing with the readability privacy

219
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,179
policy uh is like not using a bunch of

220
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,000
legalese it drives a lot of the older

221
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,580
attorneys crazy but there is a big shift

222
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,080
to write things in plain language

223
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,480
especially things that are like put out

224
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,279
to a consumer like a privacy policy or

225
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,060
terms of service in plain language so

226
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,580
this is the flesh reading ease test

227
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,580
basically

228
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,120
what it does is it using two metrics the

229
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,399
number of words

230
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,160
per sentence and the number of

231
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,240
syllables per word it gives every uh you

232
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,860
know paragraph or body of text a score

233
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,000
and these scores relate to different

234
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,760
grade levels so you can see uh the

235
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,860
higher the score the more readable it is

236
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,120
so a fifth grade reading level uh is

237
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,880
between 100 and 90. and what they want

238
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,500
from these privacy policies in terms of

239
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,200
services is uh

240
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,540
like a seventh maybe eighth grade Max

241
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,720
but as readable as possible

242
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,980
um

243
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,779
so looking at this and looking at some

244
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,880
terms of service we can see really how

245
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,060
they stack up uh Facebook's score on

246
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,640
that would be a 10th to 12th grade level

247
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,500
uh

248
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,600
and it only goes up from there with

249
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,820
Reddit and YouTube being uh

250
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,740
significantly higher so these aren't

251
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,360
very readable documents these terms of

252
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,640
service and these privacy policies

253
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,519
so that's why a lot of these laws like

254
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,680
the CCPA the VC DPA the CPA which I

255
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,380
think is a Colorado Privacy Act

256
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,519
um

257
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,920
these these new Clauses in them that

258
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,420
will enforce the readability and

259
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,860
simplicity of these terms of service and

260
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,120
privacy policies are so important

261
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,640
and then as far as the ease of finding

262
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,560
the hyperlink on the website

263
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,959
um there's a great case uh involving

264
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,060
Uber and their hyperlinks

265
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,380
um they had

266
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,420
what is it it's I think it's gray text

267
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,360
on a white background uh for their link

268
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,980
for their privacy policy or terms of

269
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,920
service and so it's basically unfindable

270
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,500
on a website so uh the Court ruled that

271
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,060
they needed to have it in blue it needs

272
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,920
to be distinguishable and it needs to be

273
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,200
at the front of the website it needs to

274
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,860
be easy to find

275
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,480
um and this one did involve specifically

276
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,860
the enforcement of an arbitration

277
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,360
provision

278
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,279
um but it's likely to see it expand to

279
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,500
uh greater context and just being like

280
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,279
enforceable generally

281
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,899
so this is a great website the terms of

282
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,360
service don't didn't read

283
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,360
um so it uh

284
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,640
it's a play on the acronym tldr

285
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,100
and what they'll do is they will

286
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,959
go into these really confusing terms of

287
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,000
service or privacy policies and they'll

288
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,160
simplify them and just provide a much

289
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,620
simpler version of it so it's a great

290
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,620
resource if you have terms of service or

291
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,300
privacy policies that you need to look

292
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,399
to like the Reddit one which is

293
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,380
particularly confusing they'll provide a

294
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,579
more simplified version of that

295
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,600
this is some more grading of

296
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,279
different websites and how well they did

297
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,959
on their reading ease of use and

298
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,779
everything so Facebook obviously not

299
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:04,079
doing great Amazon also a grade e some

300
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,120
good ones however as far as protecting

301
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,579
your data privacy our start page and

302
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:11,239
DuckDuckGo

303
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,120
here's another website with a

304
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,260
confusingly similar name which is

305
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,300
tosback.org this one's done by our

306
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,220
friends over at the eff which is a great

307
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,320
organization I highly recommend reading

308
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,880
their blogs

309
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,939
um

310
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,079
so this one will give you live updates

311
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,779
of changes to the privacy policy in

312
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,480
terms of service as they happen great

313
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,320
resource great organization

314
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,640
um but let's get back

315
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,620
to how this now that we have this legal

316
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,420
framework how it applies to how we

317
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,180
delete people's data so once again the

318
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,560
user reaches out

319
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,480
we scrape or we find the particular

320
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,540
sources that they listed and then we

321
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,980
request deletions but now we have a

322
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,120
little bit more context for that last

323
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,500
one we request the lesions either

324
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,600
through the state laws or what we often

325
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,480
look to First are these privacy policies

326
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,480
so if a user were to come to us

327
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,760
um it's the example I have here yeah

328
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,100
true people search so if a user came to

329
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,200
us and said I have information on true

330
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,000
people search

331
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,399
um I want you to delete it uh what we

332
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,300
would do

333
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,860
is we would first look at the privacy

334
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,779
policy

335
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,079
um none of this text really helps us but

336
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,720
it is the start of their privacy policy

337
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,180
but as we go down to what data they

338
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,800
collect

339
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,839
um and what they do with that data that

340
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:34,980
they collect

341
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,959
we eventually get to this one here and

342
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,180
this is where it's really important for

343
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,740
us at least

344
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,399
um

345
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,459
that link right there allows for a

346
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,579
deletion request and so if a consumer or

347
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,940
a client comes to us we will go

348
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,700
to the company's privacy policy find if

349
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,200
they have a link like that which is

350
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,920
usually good news

351
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,899
and we'll follow it uh

352
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,480
and so here simply have to put your

353
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,240
email in verify that you're not a robot

354
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,959
um

355
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,740
and then agree uh to their terms and

356
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,420
then they sent us an email in this case

357
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,279
with another link that we had to click

358
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,079
on

359
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,940
clicking on that link led us to another

360
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,100
page where we could fill out a request

361
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,160
to actually get the data deleted I don't

362
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,620
think this one

363
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,079
this one has company here

364
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,060
um a lot of them will ask if you're

365
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,620
deleting data on somebody else's behalf

366
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,779
and so if that is an option we let them

367
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,660
know that we are deleting

368
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,480
John Smith's information on his behalf

369
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,959
as uh delete your data.com but not all

370
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,699
websites and privacy policies have those

371
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,079
um

372
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,060
and so if we would have run into any

373
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,160
trouble here we would have looked for

374
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,420
this link here

375
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,940
uh

376
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,380
and importantly

377
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,839
this address here uh and then we would

378
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,459
send demand letters and that sort of

379
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,980
thing to the company uh to try and

380
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,040
enforce the deletion of that user's data

381
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,800
so this outlines a couple of the other

382
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,199
laws that are

383
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,360
built within the CCPA and some of these

384
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,019
other state laws

385
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,639
the ability to opt out of data

386
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,820
collection a lot of different state laws

387
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,639
require that they allow users to opt out

388
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,279
of the collection of their data

389
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,060
non-discrimination is a really cool one

390
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,760
that's in the CCPA you can't treat users

391
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,440
differently just because they decided

392
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,959
not to get their information collected

393
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,160
um

394
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,380
and then a lot of people and or

395
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,180
companies and organizations will have a

396
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,639
specific section outlining uh if you're

397
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,579
a California resident your rights as

398
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,800
more and more of these states uh adopt

399
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,839
data protection laws we'll hopefully see

400
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,940
that uh Bridge throughout the United

401
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,860
States and become the norm not the

402
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,279
exception

403
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,260
so to protect people's data what can be

404
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,880
done besides uh just deleting the data

405
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,260
um

406
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,079
so there's a big uh

407
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:17,339
spicy case going on right now FTC suing

408
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:22,139
kochaba which is a Data Tracking company

409
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,360
that sells data location to other

410
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,000
organizations

411
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,860
and the FTC is suing them this one's

412
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,380
kind of fun because instead of relying

413
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,019
upon the deceptive part of the FTC act

414
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,579
that I mentioned earlier this one

415
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,139
actually talks about the unfair act and

416
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,519
it says that it's unfair to track

417
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,199
people's data because that data may lead

418
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,620
to clinics places of Warship and other

419
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,199
sensitive locations so hopefully that

420
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,220
expands to where the FTC starts

421
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,660
enforcing the unfair acts and practices

422
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,360
as well unfortunately the only relief

423
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,820
they were seeking in this case was kind

424
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,040
of like blacklisting those locations so

425
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,779
you can't see if somebody actually goes

426
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,419
to those locations so it's not as robust

427
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,480
as it could be which is why the FTC

428
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,880
could do more with better laws in place

429
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,459
a federal data Protection Law would

430
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:19,380
allow them to act a little bit more

431
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,859
uh diligently

432
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,480
so here's some resources just real quick

433
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,340
monitor.firefox.com do not pay.com and

434
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,500
then of course delete your data.com

435
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,600
and I want to thank everybody for their

436
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,059

I really appreciate it

447
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,820
all right

448
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,539
I I have a question is this mic on oh

449
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,520
perfect okay if you want to ask a

450
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,679
question please come up hey there I was

451
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,700
wondering what your thoughts are on

452
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,320
Discord

453
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,440
on yeah because disc on Discord when you

454
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,880
try to delete your account all your

455
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,559
messages on Discord servers still hang

456
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,940
around

457
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,580
oh that's interesting yeah um

458
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,500
I mean I don't I don't have any personal

459
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,660
thoughts on it I think we're so far

460
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,640
behind as far as data deletion laws go

461
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,380
that any steps in the right direction

462
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,020
are great but I think something similar

463
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,940
happens with uh

464
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,460
Facebook groups I think it was or

465
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,960
something like that that'll be an

466
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,460
interesting one to get to so if you

467
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,900
would like your information deleted off

468
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,200
of Discord we would be happy to you know

469
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,059
visit the website and we can see what we

470
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,700
can do hi I'm just curious if there's

471
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,880
ways that you can maybe proxy through uh

472
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,460
European union and then get gdpr

473
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,500
enforced or if there's any tricks like

474
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,900
that I've heard of ways that you can

475
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,820
maybe get your IP coming out of

476
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,700
California and then do an opt out

477
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,980
um wondering if any of those Avenues

478
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,179
have been explored

479
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:13,919
we haven't explored them yet the good

480
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,840
thing is a lot of

481
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,179
I write a lot of privacy policies and

482
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,100
stuff and that's kind of my side of

483
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,559
things usually uh this is like a

484
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,220
non-profit that I help as well uh and

485
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,860
a lot of more organizations are caring

486
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,960
about data deletion generally and so

487
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,760
those requirements and Provisions that

488
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,220
are in the gdpr and the CCPA are being

489
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,100
applied across the board to all users so

490
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,039
I think encouraging companies to do that

491
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,419
is really our best bet

492
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,280
um but I haven't looked into like

493
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,780
patching people through

494
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,780
um

495
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,340
yeah thank you uh so my question is like

496
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,320
with the California and Virginia one is

497
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,179
there like a list somewhere of states

498
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,340
that have published a law or a policy

499
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,140
type of thing that we could go to as a

500
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,020
reference point yeah we have a couple

501
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,340
um blog posts on deleteyourdata.com uh

502
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,900
but I found a good

503
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,880
table

504
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,760
um like maybe a month ago but I forgot

505
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,419
who posted it so I will track that down

506
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:20,400
uh and find it and possibly repost it on

507
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,780
our website uh hi so I was wondering

508
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,419
with respect to the uh simplistic

509
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:28,919
language so that people can actually you

510
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,360
know understand what a privacy policy

511
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,140
means

512
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,179
when you're mapping from

513
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,160
legal language which I'm assuming has a

514
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,200
very specific intent behind a lot of

515
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,059
words you could have

516
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,700
a very precise meaning and in

517
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,500
simplifying that language you might get

518
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,600
your syllable countdown or whatever

519
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,559
metric you're using there uh but you

520
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,299
might be hiding some of the actual like

521
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,039
Precision of what

522
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,860
the the agreement actually means uh is

523
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,820
there a way to kind of

524
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,960
I guess account for that without being

525
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,640
uh falling under the category of being

526
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,020
deceptive because it's like oh well you

527
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,100
know you said one thing that has a

528
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,080
common English like understanding of

529
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,640
what it means but it it actually means

530
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,280
something a lot more uh confining

531
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,640
yeah it's a so there's a definite

532
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,720
migration uh to to just like

533
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,080
common meanings of contract terms so the

534
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,400
first when you're doing contract

535
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,539
interpretation one of the first things

536
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:25,559
you want to do is look at the plane

537
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,660
meaning uh and if the planning's there

538
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,760
and it's unambiguous then you're done

539
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,760
like uh in most cases

540
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,299
um

541
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:34,860
so

542
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,380
the idea that more complex language is

543
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,039
more precise is a bit of a fallacy so

544
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,320
you you do want to just use like

545
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,840
plain unambiguous language hey thanks

546
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,580
for the talk um I was just wondering if

547
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,039
there's like one addition or change to

548
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,679
U.S regulations with regard to people's

549
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,840
personal data and pii and things like

550
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,400
that like do you have one in your back

551
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
pocket that you'd like recommend hey

552
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,059
here's a policy change we could make

553
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,340
that would protect people's privacy and

554
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,720
help the customers you have at delete

555
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,159
yourdata.com

556
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,500
is like a government level or a company

557
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,840
yeah yeah like a a lot yeah I mean as a

558
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,640
government level if we had a federal uh

559
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,620
data Protection Law that wasn't

560
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,240
didn't have a bunch of hidden stuff in

561
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,380
it

562
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,020
um it would allow the FTC to Greater

563
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,039
like enforce data privacy a lot better

564
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,480
um yeah they're kind of handcuffed by

565
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,000
the the unfair and deceptive Acts

566
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,820
got it thanks yeah no problem

567
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,860
awesome thank you everyone

568
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:38,379
[Applause]
