20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,940
um well as we look back uh this thing

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,899
started uh 11 years ago 10 events ago so

22
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,120
this is our 10th anniversary

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,899
um

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,239
I looked back at my email and I think

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,719
the first one I came to was in 2014.

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,339
um so I wasn't wasn't with it all the

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,740
way back but uh Joe Joe Fitz put

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,159
together a collage of our old shirts and

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,840
our old badges

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,740
uh so that's super cool to think back

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,720
so who am I and why am I why am I here

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,759
uh because I didn't know how much work

33
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,020
this would be uh probably right so

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,520
um yeah so I started thinking about

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,600
doing this in 2018 you know I I wanted

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,460
to find some way to give back to the

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,540
community

38
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,979
and

39
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,900
um I enjoyed you know hanging around

40
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,360
with with the folks with the guy with

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,400
the people who were organizing the event

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,159
and sort of following Joe around

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,259
um honestly and going to board meetings

44
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,280
even though I wasn't a board member

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,320
so I helped out in 2019 by looking for

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,360
other venues other than the convention

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,200
center and really this is

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,259
probably the only other place that we

49
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,720
can hold a conference because of the

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,520
constraints that that we have and that

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,640
the other places at the venues have

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,720
um

53
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,220
yeah so yeah we started this decision on

54
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,700
for this year in December 2021 and

55
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,080
confirmed with PSU in March

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,819
so yeah we want to come here in 2020 but

57
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,220
stuff happened

58
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,580
um so other things uh other Hobbies

59
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,580
motorcycling

60
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,080
and I've been an instant Response Team

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,379
since about October 2000 and in case

62
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,840
you're wondering I do not know Hebrew

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,780
I just drink what's in front of me

64
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,959
um workshops I we probably still have

65
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,920
empty seats so go to the workshop page

66
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,599
if you're interested in one of them and

67
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,959
sign up for one and

68
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,060
hopefully and if there are seats left

69
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,860
they will still appear if they disappear

70
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,200
then that means that seats are out

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,019
feel free to use the coupon code to sign

72
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,060

73
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,459
coupon codes on that registration page

74
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,819
so the theme for 2022 basically

75
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,700
Sasquatch is out of hibernation and um

76
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,640
yeah but so after we did the virtual

77
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,120
event in 2020 we were all exhausted and

78
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,540
uh we we went into hibernation and

79
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,700
needed to take a year off so now we're

80
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,459
out although I think we still have a bit

81
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,980
of a dystopian hangover like we all

82
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,319
maybe all we all do

83
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,120
um so we started with this idea of

84
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,340
Sasquatch coming out of its cave and

85
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,819
being blinded by a cyberpunk son and uh

86
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,299
the insecurity pun is intended

87
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,080
um

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,200
yeah and big thanks to John and Melinda

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,459

90
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,519

91
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,739

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,240
been trying to turn this over so that he

170
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,759
can go to more conferences and enjoy

171
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,479
this one and not run around like a crazy

172
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,740
person

173
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,880
um

174
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,880
so I I kind of think of him as the

175
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,800
Oracle and the people Whisperer he's

176
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,660
really good at

177
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,840
um knowing exactly what to do and how to

178
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,220
get people to do it

179
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,520
um and uh those are important skills and

180
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,639
uh I wonder if I'll ever figure those

181
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,020
out

182
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,060
um yeah it seems like a organizing an

183
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,599
event is essentially effortless for him

184
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:12,180
so uh yeah

185
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,639
uh Logistics right so you've probably

186
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,580
figured out the lanyard colors uh

187
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,160
the white one is for normal attendees

188
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,580
green is for volunteers red is for the

189
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,340
safety not security safety people if you

190
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,500
have if you see something that makes you

191
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,080
uncomfortable if you have a problem

192
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,179
find a either a green lanyard or a red

193
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,719
lanyard person and we will help you out

194
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,839
we will figure out what's going on and

195
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,700
get to the bottom of it and

196
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,599
um

197
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,720
hopefully resolve it so if the green you

198
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,339
know a green lanyard person is all you

199
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,380
can find uh they will help you find

200
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,019
somebody the red lanyard and brown is

201
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,200
the speaker lanyard

202
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,320
Logistics right so uh said do not bend

203
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,779
the badge um I think everybody's figured

204
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,600
out the the swag and t-shirt exchange

205
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,080
process and I I think the the T-shirt uh

206
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,440
uh desk is been pretty busy

207
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,940
um we've talked a bit about the safety

208
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,880
team so the covet policy I think we've

209
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,220
gone over that as well

210
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,080
um food so

211
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,360
food is going to get picked up at 11 if

212
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,519
it's not already gone food and drinks so

213
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,560
make sure that you grab what you need

214
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,240
before then after the keynote there will

215
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,580
be a break for that

216
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,760
um at I believe about 4 P.M there will

217
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,700
be afternoon food and beverages served

218
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,000
and until about 7 30 pm

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,240
uh q a we've got a q one q a mic down

220
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,820
here it might be hard it's usually hard

221
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,380
at conferences for the speaker to hear

222
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,720
the actual questions so if you project

223
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,399
out towards the speaker who's going to

224
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,920
be standing here what might be easier

225
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,680
for them to hear you

226
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,940
um

227
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,040
let's see so there's no lunch break in

228
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,480
the schedule

229
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
um

230
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,779
and this will help spread out the the

231
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,019
lunch rush there are nearby eateries as

232
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,940
well as the cafe downstairs there are

233
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,120
also markets uh in this building and

234
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,519
um nearby where you can do grab and go

235
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,779
sandwiches

236
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,300
a lot of things within two blocks up

237
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,580
here essentially

238
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,440
um let's see what else

239
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,480
so the doors the public doors on

240
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,600
Broadway will be closed and locked at 5

241
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,760
PM PSU is keeping them open an extra

242
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,980
hour normally they close the lock at

243
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,940
four so if you want to go out uh after 5

244
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,800
PM and come back in make sure you have a

245
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,420
door buddy or somebody you can

246
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,399
communicate with on the inside to let

247
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,860
you back in

248
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,240
although there does seem to be a fair

249
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,920
bit of traffic you can probably get you

250
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,899
can probably wing it

251
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,040
um

252
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,380
right so live stream

253
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,779
um we're live streaming to YouTube uh

254
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,320
that'll end about uh 5 15

255
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,480
and it won't it won't uh be there for

256
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,740
the quiz show

257
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,019
uh and if you need the link it's on the

258
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,399
b-sides uh pdx.org homepage

259
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,459
all right contests and events the CTF

260
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,920
it's running it'll run till 6 30

261
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,980
approximately and then prizes will be

262
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,800
given out after the quiz show

263
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,260
um the prices are

264
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,540
quite extreme this year we spent more

265
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,040
than a thousand dollars I think there

266
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,140
might be a flipper zero uh to be had

267
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,459
it's uh yeah I wish I could be uh beyond

268
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,399
the CTA or uh compete in the CTF

269
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,260
um so that's pretty cool so quiz show

270
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,300
six to seven Steve willoughby's gonna be

271
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,480
back to do that I need to ask Steve and

272
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,360
confirm but in past years we didn't have

273
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,399
to answer in the form of a question

274
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,459
we'll have to we'll have to see

275
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,720
so make sure you pay attention to the

276
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,279
rules on that one that's always fun
