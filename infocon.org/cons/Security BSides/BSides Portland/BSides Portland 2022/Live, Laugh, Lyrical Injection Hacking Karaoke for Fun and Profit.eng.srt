1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,620
next up we've got Nate Norton with live

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,600
the laugh lyrical injection hacking

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,120
karaoke for Fun and Profit

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,040
so let's give a big welcome to grenade

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,920
hi

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,820
so I'm Nate and before we begin I am

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,119
legally required to inform you that I am

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,900
a CI double SP which will make sense in

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,020
a minute I am also legally required to

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,600
inform you that this information is for

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,540
research purposes only and should not be

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,040
used for Mischief wink

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,300
so uh who am I

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,820
I am a security engineer

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,260
I play guitar and I sing in a rock band

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,960
uh I build giant puppets that light up

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,980
at night and I love karaoke and uh

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,040
my parents are very proud of me despite

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,939
all of those things

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,920
so

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,580
somebody once told me that in order to

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,240
hack something you have to know it so

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,640
let's get to another karaoke protocol so

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,420
first of all uh who who knows what

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,400
karaoke is

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,799
all right most of us who has been to

27
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,600
karaoke

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,360
all right who has sung at karaoke

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,659
my people

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
all right

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,100
um

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,340
so for those of you who do not know

33
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,060
uh karaoke is a form of entertainment in

34
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,939
which Brave or intoxicated individuals

35
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,640
sing along to pre-recorded instrumental

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,340
versions of popular songs where the

37
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,500
lyrics are displayed for the singer on a

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
screen in time with the music an attempt

39
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,079
to mirror the original performance of

40
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,699
the song

41
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,380
all right so what is the karaoke

42
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,360
protocol

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,879
it turns out that the authors of the

44
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,099
karaoke protocol have neglected to

45
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:21,300
submit an RFC so we have to make a lot

46
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,520
of inferences about what the karaoke

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,980
protocol actually is but it goes

48
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,480
something like this

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,459
you go to karaoke

50
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,620
first step

51
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,800
you flip through a book usually and you

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,739
pick out a song that you want to sing

53
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,200
and then you sign up for karaoke by

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,819
putting your name on a piece of paper

55
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,280
along with the song title and handing it

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,319
to the karaoke host

57
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,780
at some point they call your name they

58
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,580
give you a microphone you go up and you

59
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,400
sing the song if you're having fun you

60
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,099
repeat steps two through four and

61
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,739
nothing bad happens and you go home in

62
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,340
all as well

63
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,980
so let's take a look at some terms in

64
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,500
order to further understand what the

65
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,780
karaoke protocol is

66
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,480
the first and most important one is the

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,159
karaoke session

68
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,060
this is where people go to sing karaoke

69
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,780
then we have the karaoke host

70
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,239
which is the person that facilitates the

71
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,239
karaoke session there can be more than

72
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,620
one host we call this a karaoke Network

73
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,099
then we have the karaoke guest who

74
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,959
participates in the karaoke session

75
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,340
regardless of whether they are singing

76
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,560
we have my personal favorite the karaoke

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,379
service which is the bar

78
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,400
and then some specific terms we have DNS

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
which stands for do not sing you are cut

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,159
off go home

81
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,099
and then perhaps the most egregious

82
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,799
offender that threatens the health and

83
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,980
safety of the karaoke session is the APT

84
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,920
or the advanced persistent talker

85
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
someone who will not shut the hell up

86
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
when other people are singing

87
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,660
the reason I'm here today is because I

88
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,260
have discovered not one but two

89
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,720
vulnerabilities in the karaoke protocol

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,060
that I wanted I would like to share with

91
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,780
you

92
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,940
the first one is weak Authentication

93
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,020
and in some cases no Authentication

94
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,000
the second one is a term that I have

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,860
coined lyrical injection

96
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,680
and unfortunately karaoke vendors have

97
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,520
still not patched these vulnerabilities

98
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,320
so who knows what else is out there

99
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,560
I have been studying karaoke for 20 some

100
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,900
odd years at this point I have

101
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,960
participated in many karaoke sessions as

102
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,300
a guest I have hosted a few karaoke

103
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,139
sessions of my own I even played bass in

104
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,720
a live karaoke Rock Band for a number of

105
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,139
years and so for the last couple of

106
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,720
years or so I have been researching

107
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,900
threats to karaoke

108
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,100
and uh

109
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,380
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

110
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,780
but I think that I have discovered the

111
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,460
motivation uh for these miscreants uh

112
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,979
can anybody guess what that might be

113
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,979
fun

114
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,520
close

115
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,479
it's lulls

116
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,639
so let's take a look at the first

117
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,840
vulnerability weak Authentication

118
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,800
it turns out that if you go to a certain

119
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,860
place at a certain time and you write

120
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,759
down any name and I mean any name on a

121
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,440
piece of paper and you hand it to

122
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,440
somebody they will give you a microphone

123
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,139
for five minutes

124
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,759
big mistake

125
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,180
this vulnerability is often exploited to

126
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,240
escalate privileges in order to gain an

127
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,580
audience and when you have an audience

128
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,440
what could possibly go wrong

129
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,560
but don't just take my word for this if

130
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,419
you for whatever reason against my

131
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,220
warning would like to exploit this for

132
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,419
yourselves

133
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,819
this is the methodology

134
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,699
you go to karaoke

135
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,139
you write down a name and a song title

136
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,600
you hand the karaoke host the piece of

137
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,180
paper which initiates a reverse shell on

138
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,139
the karaoke host

139
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,699
when your name is called and they will

140
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,919
call your name or whatever name that you

141
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,060
wrote down retrieve the microphone

142
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,979
your privileges are automatically

143
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:11,479
escalated congratulations

144
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,060
this attack from happening how do we

145
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,160
stop this in its tracks what is the

146
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,940
mitigation I'm afraid there is none this

147
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,160
is just the way this system was designed

148
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,740
so the reason that I know that this

149
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,319
exists in the first place is uh because

150
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,960
I have personally exploited these

151
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,020
vulnerabilities I went to Defcon for the

152
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,199
first time this year who was a Defcon

153
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,000
awesome

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,180
so uh Friday night I stumbled into

155
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,979
hacker karaoke

156
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:53,400
and I wrote down my name I wrote down my

157
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,199
real name and I realized that this is

158
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,139
poor operational security however I

159
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,139
desired attribution for this attack so I

160
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,080
felt that it was an okay compromise so I

161
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,900
wrote down my real name and a song title

162
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,360
and I handed it to the karaoke host

163
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,120
initiating the reverse shell and a

164
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,300
couple of hours later they called my

165
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,460
name and I retrieved the microphone and

166
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,620
my privileges were escalated and from

167
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,539
there I pivoted into giving an

168
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:26,599
unofficial Defcon talk at karaoke

169
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,319
the subject of which was

170
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,140
lyrical injection vulnerability number

171
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,380
two

172
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,599
so what is lyrical injection

173
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,899
it is a timing based exploit where an

174
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,540
attacker chooses a song and replaces the

175
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,180
words with the lyrics and the melody of

176
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,060
another song an attempt of denial of

177
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,680
service to the original song

178
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,839
when lyrical injection is performed at

179
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,080
karaoke it can become viral and infect

180
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,620
the guest who often helplessly Echo the

181
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,500
lyrical payload it usually results in

182
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,600
the karaoke host shaking their damn

183
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,480
heads this is actually how you know that

184
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,040
the attack has succeeded

185
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,300
the methodology that I am going to

186
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,360
describe for this attack is based on the

187
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,839
Lockheed Martin cyber kill chain it is

188
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,600
seven steps that follows an attacker's

189
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,320
path as they exploit lyrical injection

190
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,220
the first stage is Recon

191
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,240
so

192
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,580
first step of Recon is pick a Target

193
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,339
song that you would like to exploit the

194
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,440
more popular the song is the more

195
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,360
vulnerable this song is

196
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,700
step two pick another song and extract

197
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,399
the lyrics and the Melody I recommend

198
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,459
using fuzzing techniques

199
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,580
pick a karaoke session to go to

200
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,180
now luckily for those of us in Portland

201
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,760
there is a and I quote venerable tiki

202
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,000
bar with nightly karaoke also known as

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,899
The Alibi Tiki Lounge right here in

204
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:21,420
northeast Portland and it's right next

205
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,720
to the weedland Portland dispensary so

206
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,440
you can't miss it

207
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,420
let's weaponize a payload

208
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,240
the first step is to replace the lyrics

209
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,480
of the target song

210
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,899
and then practice this superposition and

211
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,519
if you are having a difficult time

212
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,940
getting the timing of this correct I

213
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,279
recommend that you study the techniques

214
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,920
of the lyrical injection researcher

215
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,700
Pioneer Neil sisioriga he has produced

216
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,040
no less than four albums in which he has

217
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,000
superimposed the 1991 1999 critically

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,300
acclaimed hit All-Star

219
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,079
onto other songs

220
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,800
uh step three delivery

221
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,699
go to karaoke

222
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,779
[Music]

223
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,540
exploitation

224
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,839
uh step one write down any name and I

225
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,079
mean any name and the target song title

226
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,760
step two hand this to the karaoke host

227
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,640
reverse shell initiated there will be no

228
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,740
input validation as a matter of fact in

229
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,540
the history of karaoke there has never

230
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,640
been a single instance of input

231
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,860
validation at this step so if you've

232
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,720
made it this far your attack will

233
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,980
succeed congratulations

234
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
foreign

235
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,300
retrieve the microphone when the name

236
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,680
you wrote down is called

237
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,500
command and control

238
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,079
perform the song perform the modified

239
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
version of the song move laterally

240
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,200
around the stage

241
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,860
actions on objective

242
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,800
step one finish the song

243
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,260
step two walk off the stage but please

244
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,560
do not drop the microphone it hurts

245
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,800
step three uh do a little dance or

246
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,260
something and profit congratulations

247
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,660
you've just hacked karaoke

248
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,260
so

249
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,940
how do we prevent this how do we

250
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,639
mitigate lyrical injection there are

251
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,620
three controls that are possible in this

252
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,139
scenario the first is a deterrent

253
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,000
control which is projecting the lyrics

254
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,459
on a screen that is visible to both the

255
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,279
singer and the audience however much

256
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,380
like a security camera that is not

257
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,680
turned on this is a very weak control

258
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,360
then we have the corrective control

259
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,459
which is turning down the microphone

260
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,160
once the attack is detected

261
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,779
unfortunately by the time the attack is

262
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,220
detected it is too late and the song

263
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,320
will continue for as long as the

264
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,079
attacker intends it too

265
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,180
the third control which is perhaps the

266
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,040
only effective control in this situation

267
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,680
is a compensating control of acceptance

268
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,139
because if you can't beat them you might

269
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,860
as well join them

270
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,320
all right so before we continue

271
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,660
I

272
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,660
for those of you who are not going to

273
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,120
heed the legal notice that I put out at

274
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,459
the beginning of this presentation I

275
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,560
feel that as my due diligence to inform

276
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,720
you of the consequences should you

277
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,000
decide to attempt lyrical injection

278
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,480
yourself

279
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,940
the absolute best case scenario if you

280
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,980
attempt lyrical injection is that you

281
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,899
get permanently banned from karaoke

282
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,519
the slightly worse outcome is If you

283
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,860
experience extreme disapproval from the

284
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,459
audience and or the karaoke host

285
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:29,339
even worse than that is if you get

286
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,339
extreme approval from the audience and

287
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,320
or the karaoke host and the absolute

288
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,060
worst thing that can possibly happen to

289
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,220
you if you attempt lyrical injection is

290
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,720
that you now have a horde of followers

291
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,120
and you are a leader of a cult good luck

292
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,660
have fun

293
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,940
but don't take my word for it let's hack

294
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,220
some karaoke

295
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,360
so

296
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,839
at this point I believe that we may have

297
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,760
to mute the live stream and so if

298
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,880
if you are watching this from afar and

299
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,279
you do not hear anything it is nothing

300
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,779
to do with you we just have to be

301
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,420
careful with copyrights IP intellectual

302
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,240
property right all right so

303
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,300
um we're at karaoke and I have a

304
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,839
weaponized payload that is delivered

305
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,680
and I am about to exploit the song John

306
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,560
Lennon's imagine

307
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,579
right here we go

308
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
thank you and once again

309
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,600
um this is for research purposes only

310
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,699
uh so

311
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,719
time for a q a

312
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,519
critical injection that I would refer to

313
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,680
as the Weird Al attack

314
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,820
um and whether you thought about

315
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,980
deploying that in the wild

316
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,920
um oh yeah So Weird Al is uh he is an

317
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,079
inspiration for this type of attack I

318
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,320
would consider that the uh the spray and

319
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,360
pray variant of lyrical injection

320
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,220
strictly for research purposes only for

321
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,199
research purposes only when you see the

322
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:19,079
lyrical injection attack happening would

323
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,480
a counter Brute Force attack mitigate

324
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,339
the issue

325
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,320
that's a great question you will have to

326
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,060
try that out and let me know how it goes

327
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,320
you're missing the most important part

328
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,360
how are you going to cover Your Tracks

329
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,240
how am I going to cover if I delete the

330
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,800
logs

331
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,540
I haven't thought about this more

332
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,699
research is required

333
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,759
thank you what is the best karaoke song

334
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,100
for this type of injection and why is it

335
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,000
Bohemian Rhapsody

336
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,380
that question speaks for itself

337
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,259
uh do you have any recommendations for

338
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,240
generating aliases for anonymization

339
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,380
purposes

340
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,140
oh that is a that is a great question

341
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,760
um what I really like is like you know

342
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,919
in the password generators how you can

343
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,459
generate three words uh at a time yeah

344
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,280
yeah exactly so that that's my preferred

345
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,299
method

346
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,220
I'm looking to create a new startup

347
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,020
around machine learning how can AI be

348
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,099
used to prevent this injection

349
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,599
yes

350
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,419
um all right well I I presume that there

351
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,900
are investors here and um yes yes we

352
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,720
will get your company funded

353
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,679
have you ever tried this on

354
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,340
uh that's actually how I test out my

355
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,340
lyrical injection attempts so yes all

356
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,840
right

357
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,520
I think that's it

358
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,000
for those who have the slides I've

359
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,320
linked to a couple of resources

360
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,679
including my experience at Defcon and

361
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,900
um I've linked to a couple of Neil CeCe

362
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,000
Arrigo videos I highly recommend that

363
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,360
you listen to those and then um here

364
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,860
there's for those who get the slides

365
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,480
there is a very good source song to

366
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,400
extract the lyrics from

367
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,620
um which is most definitely not uh Rick

368
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,000
