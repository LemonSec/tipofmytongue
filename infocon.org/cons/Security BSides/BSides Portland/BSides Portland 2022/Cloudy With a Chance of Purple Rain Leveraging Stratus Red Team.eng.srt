1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,220
Luciano Avendano uh with a Code 42 based

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,779
out of Minneapolis uh his talk is uh

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,000
Cloudy with a Chance of Purple Rain just

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,099
magnificent color scheme

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,080
um but essentially a presentation on

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,880
using uh the stratus red team and Vector

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,980
to automate and do like a purple team

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,000
assessments would you say that's fair

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,460
like in your own well he's the authority

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm gonna shut up

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,980
awesome thanks thank you thank you

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,500
what's uh besides Portland thank you

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,699
very much for the opportunity to come

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,140
over here and and talk a little bit

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,360
about pen testing in the cloud

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,520
uh for the purpose of the talk I'm kind

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,360
of focused on in AWS mostly but the tool

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,980
that I'll be talking about does apply to

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,960
some of the other Cloud vendors like as

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,660
Azure and gcp and um there's some stuff

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,700
in there for kubernetes as well too but

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,680
for the purpose of the talk just Amazon

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,519
AWS

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,600
um what I got on the agenda so I'll talk

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,739
a little I'll give a shout out to my

26
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,020
purple team at Code 42 we've been over

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,460
the last few months they've been you

28
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,840
know sort of the inspiration for putting

29
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,399
the presentation together

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,739
we've had several exercises where we

31
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,140
just learned so much about our Cloud

32
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,479
environment right and we figured that at

33
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,159
the end when you know we started putting

34
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,560
a lot of these uh findings a lot of the

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,240
the stuff that we were kind of working

36
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,619
through the challenges we're like you

37
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,420
know what this would be really awesome

38
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,520
if we put it together into a

39
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,500
presentation and and you know kind of

40
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,000
put it out there to the community and

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,259
hopefully others can learn from it as

42
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,439
well so ultimately the my goal is to

43
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,299
kind of give this as another resource

44
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,540
for pen testers red teamers blue teamers

45
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,420
um that are using the cloud as as

46
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,360
they're either their cicd pipeline to

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,799
host their products whatever your

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,079
company is using the cloud for this uh

49
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,320
this can hopefully hopefully help you

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,180
I'll give a little bit of background and

51
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,840
context on what we will discuss

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,220
um a little bit of the preparation and

53
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,600
execution that kind of goes into the

54
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,180
exercise uh you know what after I kind

55
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,680
of started going through this I realized

56
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,360
that this could have been a workshop as

57
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,880
well rather than a talk because a lot of

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,340
it is obviously Hands-On keyboard uh

59
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,899
working through some of the uh the the

60
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,940
actual exercises and executing you know

61
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,260
the binary uh at your at your terminal

62
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,879
uh then I'll talk a little bit about

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,459
detection and what we use to document it

64
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,220
and detect detection and documentation

65
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,340
could um kind of be and can be used in

66
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,599
the same sense

67
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,640
Lessons Learned and then I'll just

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,500
conclude it with that but ultimately I

69
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,819
hope that you learned a little bit about

70
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,099
cloud pen testing

71
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,200
okay

72
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,739
all right so shout out to Laura and Zach

73
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,300
they have been instrumental in working

74
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,099
so they're my blue teamers I'm the only

75
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,540
red team right now currently with the

76
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,500
company

77
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,060
they've been super instrumental in

78
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,220
helping me put these exercises together

79
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,379
and getting a lot of value from them as

80
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,640
as we go through them so we've been

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,620
working on this for the last several

82
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,840
months now and a lot of value has come

83
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,280
out of it

84
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,920
so shout out to them all right a little

85
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,019
bit of background on modeling attacker

86
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,819
Behavior especially in the cloud I'll

87
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,260
talk a little bit about threat Intel

88
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,319
detecting your ioas iocs or indicators

89
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,140
of compromise indicators of attacks a

90
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,640
little bit about purple teaming in case

91
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,739
for the in case there's some of you that

92
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,120
don't understand the the concept of

93
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,379
purple teaming

94
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,120
and then I'll talk about or mention a

95
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,440
little bit of complexities in the cloud

96
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,980
and how Stratus can kind of help solve

97
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,819
some of those complexities

98
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,840
so modeling attacker behavior I'm sure

99
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,580
if you've all seen the Cyber kill chain

100
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,080
whether it be Lockheed Martin the

101
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,879
unified kill chain this is the an

102
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,319
example of the Manion targeted attack

103
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,659
life cycle I wanted something simple so

104
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,879
I kind of use this the idea behind here

105
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,819
is that you wanna model attacker

106
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,799
Behavior especially in the cloud there's

107
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,720
not too many resources that can kind of

108
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,400
help you

109
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,799
um you know figure out how a lot of

110
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,540
attackers are are gaining or

111
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,299
compromising cloud cloud environments

112
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,420
for uh Stratus doesn't really cover the

113
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,640
entire life cycle what you'll notice is

114
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,980
that Stratus is more of a post

115
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,680
compromised

116
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,080
tool that can help you after there's

117
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,299
been a breach right but the idea with

118
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,099
strategies is that it'll recreate a lot

119
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,959
of that attacker Behavior so that your

120
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,180
blue team can be respond to it more

121
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,738
efficiently

122
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,019
so I use this more as just a model not

123
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,639
only that but it can also help you

124
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,240
develop more of a full chain uh or full

125
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,800
kill chain sorry full kill chain

126
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,380
exercise where your red team can

127
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,300
obviously do a lot of the initial Recon

128
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,759
a lot of part of the initial compromise

129
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,560
and then use Stratus as a post

130
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,520
compromise tool

131
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,560
uh I'm sure you've all seen the minor

132
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,080
attack Matrix as well too there's a

133
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,520
really good section in there for cloud

134
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,560
Matrix I wanted to mention that as well

135
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,080
too this was a really good resource for

136
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,639
uh developing some of our exercises

137
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,139
right because you can go through them as

138
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,759
part of each one of those phases of the

139
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,800
kill chain and see which one of those

140
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,840
can apply to Stratus

141
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,240
from there we can just kind of organize

142
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,360
it and um you know more so use it as a

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,199
blueprint

144
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,820
so just kind of putting it up there for

145
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,180
reference

146
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,680
uh threat insulin detecting I OAS you'll

147
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,080
notice that the stratus can also help

148
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,100
you and I'll talk a little bit more

149
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,540
about stress I know I'm just mentioning

150
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,120
it right now uh it'll help you start

151
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,699
building a catalog of iOS and iocs right

152
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,080
if you don't have that right now it's

153
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,820
such a great way to Baseline that right

154
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,440
because if you get asked that question

155
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,020
is like okay what kind of iOS or iocs

156
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,639
are we looking for in the cloud and if

157
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,139
you don't really have a quick answer to

158
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,060
that this will help you build that

159
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,160
catalog so that

160
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,919
um you know when you ultimately build

161
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,500
detection detections or alerts out of it

162
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,380
this can become a good reference now I

163
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,460
put a good you know some seam

164
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,259
s-i-e-m Solutions out here

165
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:50,880
because these are a good way to start

166
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,380
collecting a lot of that data right and

167
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,699
I know some of these are pricey

168
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,080
especially

169
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,639
um when you know you work in a small to

170
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,639
medium medium-sized business

171
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,280
um but they ultimately help you collect

172
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,860
a lot of that activity stored into you

173
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,840
know an appliance like Splunk or Sumo

174
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,160
Sumo logic

175
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,840
and start building off those queries

176
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,820
right to build your the text uh your

177
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,580
detection or alerting from it so again

178
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,080
for the purpose of the talk I'm using

179
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,660
AWS right there there's a small little

180
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,780
cloud trail snippet of a log entry you

181
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,520
could then either keep it in cloudtrail

182
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,080
which I don't recommend because it's

183
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,880
much harder to parse through all a lot

184
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,680
of that cloud the cloud trail activity

185
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,500
instead you want to send it off to a

186
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,020
you know a law collection some some

187
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,000
block collection system I could have

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,979
pulled uh put elk up here too as well

189
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,080
too that that would have suffice it as a

190
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,440
good solution

191
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,759
all right concept on purple teaming to

192
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,960
buzzword right that's kind of been

193
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,600
around for for a little while now uh

194
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,120
We've adopted the methodology at our at

195
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
our company it's been working really

196
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,419
well the the program just continues to

197
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,220
mature right the more the more and more

198
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,319
that we run these exercises the better

199
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,300
it helps us in

200
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,440
um you know testing these attack

201
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,780
techniques improving you know it's

202
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,580
definitely helping improve our Defenders

203
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,620
improve our communication it obviously

204
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,720
Fosters collaboration and Lessons

205
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,759
Learned this model will probably not

206
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,740
work for everyone right but it's a good

207
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,860
model if you have a good

208
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,259
team if you have a good team good

209
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,340
attitude right a good um a good sense of

210
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,900
collaboration and just the whole

211
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,880
communication aspect of it but the more

212
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,319
and more you do this the better you get

213
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,840
at it right so I'm up here telling you

214
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,180
that that this works this works if if

215
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,460
you have a good solid team that will

216
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,539
help you improve it

217
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,740
uh what I didn't mention though is that

218
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,180
the whole concept of purple team right

219
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,340
you have your red team which is your

220
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,259
attackers or your offensive security and

221
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:47,639
you have your blue team which is your

222
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,080
Defenders right so when you combine both

223
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,759
of them and you work together

224
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,220
obviously you get purple and that's

225
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,759
that's the uh the naming behind it

226
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,580
all right complexities in the cloud uh

227
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,199
difficulty in setting up with testing

228
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,180
environment it can be right and the

229
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,160
reason why I bring that up is because

230
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,680
you have several Cloud providers each

231
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,300
one of those Cloud providers has

232
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,300
hundreds of services right

233
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,580
yeah some of them are similar you know

234
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,319
they can kind of you know there's some

235
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,780
overlap between AWS and Azure for

236
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,699
example right and concept but naming may

237
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,879
not may not be the same the naming or

238
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,560
you know just the way the authentication

239
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,960
authorization mechanisms work you know

240
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,400
completely totally different they're

241
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,199
vendors they're you know their their

242
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,479
idea is to you know build a much better

243
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,059
model than their their um

244
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,179
their counterpart or

245
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:41,099
so that's what makes it complex is when

246
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,659
you build a testing environment like

247
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,880
what what cloud provider do I use what

248
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,140
cloud provider is your organization

249
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,480
using or which cloud provider do they

250
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,940
intend on utilizing for their services

251
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,100
uh emerging through emerging threat

252
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,200
landscape that's another big one

253
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,660
because there's so many Cloud providers

254
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,019
and and uh cloud services that threat

255
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,519
landscape becomes much bigger the attack

256
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,380
surface becomes much bigger right so

257
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,839
having a good understanding of that can

258
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,160
help help out

259
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,899
uh different and I just mentioned

260
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,100
different Cloud providers and different

261
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,260
requirements uh that's true especially

262
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,060
in authentication and authorization the

263
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,760
each cloud provider can have a different

264
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,320
mechanism for that

265
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,420
security controls can be challenging yes

266
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,339
they can I just mentioned that each one

267
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,480
of those Cloud providers can have

268
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,040
hundreds of services how do you protect

269
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,360
every one of those

270
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,779
right and um you go to AWS they have

271
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,220
something like cloudwatch that'll help

272
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,279
you monitor a lot a lot of your services

273
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,600
Azure has something completely different

274
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,080
uh gcp Google cloud provider has our

275
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,640
platform has a completely different

276
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,459
different one so it becomes a huge

277
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,699
challenge

278
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,940
uh I mentioned on new tools and

279
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,140
Technologies can also present a

280
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,519
challenge right so when you when you

281
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,980
incorporate or you adapt a new Tool uh

282
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,660
especially if it's a new tool that

283
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,760
nobody has you know you know played

284
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,200
around with or had time to like actually

285
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,899
try out uh it can be challenging because

286
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,640
you have to learn how to deploy it you

287
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,260
have to learn how to teach others how to

288
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,300
deploy it and use it

289
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,920
um it may require several dependencies

290
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,740
rather either software Hardware

291
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,680
it may require support maintenance right

292
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,940
like all these things that kind of go

293
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,220
into implementing a new tool

294
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,420
um and for some it could become a

295
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,220
roadblock especially in lean security

296
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,899
teams where your security team is only

297
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,399
like maybe three or four people right

298
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,959
and they're all doing every all those

299
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,560
security things

300
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,080
so I present you Stratus Red Team all

301
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,820
right I'm gonna give a huge shout out a

302
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,740
shout out to Christoph Stefani the

303
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,959
reaper he's an employee at datadog he's

304
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,120
the one that currently is maintaining it

305
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,980
and there's a several it's open source

306
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,959
right so there's several um people that

307
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,420
are kind of contributing to it

308
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,279
uh what it is is just a collection of

309
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,920
cloud native attacks currently AWS has

310
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,940
the most

311
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,459
um attacks as part of the Tool uh they

312
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,760
just started adding more for gcp there

313
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,560
are some attacks for kubernetes and

314
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,959
Azure as well too

315
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,120
very similar concept to Atomic red team

316
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,800
by Red Canary if you if you're all

317
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,660
familiar with it all right it's just a

318
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,860
collection of attacks that you can

319
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,620
deploy in your own corporate Network or

320
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,720
or Corp or corporate system and

321
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,440
infrastructure uh that can help you you

322
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,959
know run these attack attacks exploit a

323
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,880
system or exploit some file system and

324
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,220
you know gather passwords and help The

325
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,100
Blue Team detect those very similar

326
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,720
concept that's exactly what Stratus is

327
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,500
doing

328
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,920
so when you run Stratus it it will

329
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,660
launch an attack

330
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,860
it'll generate all of the activity and

331
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,959
allow the Defenders to then look at that

332
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,120
activity so they can build your ioas and

333
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,920
iocs out of that right or your detection

334
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,160
rules and detect alerts

335
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,279
uh it easily maps to miter attack

336
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,160
and it's executed via CLI so there's no

337
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,140
complex like systems that you have to

338
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,720
set up for it it's a go binary that I'll

339
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,760
mention in the next slide here

340
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,040
it's a go binary that you can easily

341
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,800
pull down from the GitHub

342
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,100
uh repo and deployed in any Linux

343
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,500
Windows or Mac OS endpoint right the the

344
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,480
easiest way that I found my personally

345
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,220
to to deploy it is just download the

346
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,839
binary because then I can just kind of

347
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,880
move it around or not even that just you

348
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,459
know make it easier it's already it's

349
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,560
already compiled uh for your operating

350
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,880
system

351
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,140
and you don't have any other

352
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,720
dependencies to to install with it uh

353
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,459
there is you could also use Brew install

354
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,860
on Mac OS if you want to go that route

355
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,480
or you can also just pull down the

356
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,100
docker image as well too

357
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,260
it does have one third-party dependency

358
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,480
but it is part of Stratus and that's the

359
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,519
beauty of it uh it's hashicorps

360
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,959
terraform if you haven't heard of

361
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,240
terraform it's an awesome basically

362
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,000
instrumentation tool right it has an AWS

363
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,100
CLI uh

364
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,200
API that's able to you know connect to

365
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,620
your AWS and kind of set up a lot of the

366
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,579
infrastructure the prerequisite

367
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,920
infrastructure as part of the attack and

368
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,360
we'll kind of dive into it a little bit

369
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,399
a little bit later

370
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,860
but there's no extra installation for it

371
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,360
the first time you run Stratus it

372
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,980
actually pulls down the terraform binary

373
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,420
from

374
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,160
um from the correct Source right it

375
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,079
doesn't actually go out anywhere else to

376
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,480
pull it down so that if you're running

377
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,339
terraform already in your environment it

378
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:21,779
doesn't mess with that version of

379
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,180
terraform right like this is a sort of a

380
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,700
self-contained locally controlled on

381
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,440
your file system right it has nothing to

382
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,120
do with with any other version of it

383
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,459
some of the key Concepts so

384
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,680
four main key concepts for Stratus right

385
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,680
there's a warm-up uh where you run the

386
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,560
warm-up command and that's where it sets

387
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,500
up your pre-rec infrastructure without

388
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,300
detonating so it doesn't actually launch

389
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,339
the attack yet it has to make sure that

390
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,000
that uh prerequisite infrastructure

391
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,500
exists and what I mean by that for

392
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,880
example if we are going to try and

393
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,940
exfiltrate an S3 bucket well that it

394
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,459
won't mess with any existing S3 buckets

395
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,800
currently in your AWS environment it's

396
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,420
going to create one

397
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,459
as part of the warm-up that's the one

398
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:09,839
that we're going to mess with as part of

399
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,399
the test that's why I kind of point out

400
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,899
that it's good to have a good testing

401
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,880
environment right whether it be like a

402
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,440
free you know free account that you get

403
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,120
with AWS

404
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,320
that way you're not messing with

405
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,240
anything production all we're getting

406
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,180
from Strat running status is the log

407
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,800
activity that's what we're interested in

408
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,019
right like what when we run one of these

409
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,700
techniques what does it actually look

410
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,079
like on the log and we're gonna we're

411
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,820
gonna see that right now

412
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,060
detonate actually executes the attack

413
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,639
revert can put you back to a state where

414
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,220
you can re-uh re-detonate an attack

415
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,980
right so if you wanted to you know rerun

416
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,560
the same attack multiple times uh the

417
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,000
revert connect and kind of put you into

418
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,699
that into that state where you can rerun

419
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:51,899
it again

420
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,240
and then clean up here's a this is my

421
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,860
one of my favorite features from this

422
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,500
tool is that a cleanup will basically

423
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,420
leave everything back the way it started

424
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,880
so if it created an S3 bucket

425
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,160
it'll delete remove that S3 bucket so

426
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,240
that you don't have any dangling

427
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,040
resources left over behind that's that's

428
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,800
awesome not a lot of tools do that

429
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,959
um if if you all are familiar with um

430
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,000
you know pen testing

431
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,279
pen testing tools for the cloud there's

432
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,339
a framework called paku which is very

433
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:21,779
similar except that Paco doesn't

434
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,760
actually create any prereq

435
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,680
infrastructure for it right like with

436
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,680
Paco you're just you're pen testing your

437
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,360
production environment essentially if

438
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,180
that's the route you go with Stratus it

439
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,920
creates the prereq environment for you

440
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,720
so that it doesn't mess with any of your

441
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
production

442
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,920
um resources

443
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,620
um so he's it's as easy as having an AWS

444
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,240
account ready to go

445
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,100
you can list all the attack techniques

446
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,540
that are available

447
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,820
and you just detonate it that's as easy

448
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,940
as as it gets there's no like extra

449
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,880
fluff that you have to add to it

450
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,639
under the hood so here's what it does

451
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,740
I mentioned warm-up to create that

452
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,720
prereq right so on the on the left frame

453
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,660
we have our terraform main TF file

454
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,240
Stratus creates this for you right it

455
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,980
says okay

456
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,100
uh I'm going to for this one I'm uh I'm

457
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,079
launching

458
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,579
I can't even see my own slides

459
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,899
ah this one was this attack technique is

460
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,880
going to grab ec2 password data for

461
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,279
Windows ec2 instances

462
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,380
all right you don't have to have ec2

463
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,000
instances already set up in your

464
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,740
environment terraform is going to create

465
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,980
it for you right so this first file as

466
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,839
you run warm up it's going to create

467
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,000
that infrastructure for you it's going

468
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,220
to add the necessary rows to it right

469
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,660
and then it's just going to sit there

470
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,740
and it's going to wait for you to

471
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,240
detonate it once you're ready to do the

472
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,920
attack your blue team is ready like all

473
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,420
right we're ready to parse those logs

474
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,920
look you know start sitting through

475
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,440
those lugs you hit detonate and it does

476
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,079
the attack and this one specifically

477
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:05,280
um I'm running a get a password function

478
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,859
so that's what you would be seeing on

479
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,619
the other end so I use cloudtrail as the

480
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,599
as sort of the log activity that's

481
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,160
happening

482
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,260
um what Stratus did what the developer

483
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,119
did which is a great design right so

484
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,400
instead of just having tons of like this

485
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,199
activity and kind of sifting through it

486
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,720
and trying to figure out well which is

487
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,339
you know which are the events that I'm

488
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,740
interested in that Stratus created

489
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,400
he pre-pended a user agent with Stratus

490
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,799
on it with just a uuid that's you know

491
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,820
just kind of arbitrary but as as your

492
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,260
blue team is going through the logs and

493
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,700
looking for this activity they just

494
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,100
search for Stratus right and it'll find

495
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,659
all the activity that strategy

496
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,760
uh detonation that's when you actually

497
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,919
execute it all right so once you execute

498
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,419
the attack

499
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,080
you can

500
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,360
only have two more minutes all right

501
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,160
Vector those are the other two so this

502
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,320
is a tool that we use for actually you

503
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,820
know collecting and documenting that

504
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,760
data so vectors are currently developed

505
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,620
by security risk advisors it's a free

506
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,780
free documentation tool it's really good

507
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,640
for purple teaming as well

508
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,740
you use it I have the no more

509
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,940
spreadsheets little you know

510
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,080
cancellation over here because when we

511
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,580
started these exercises we were using

512
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,500
spreadsheets very easily very quickly

513
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,900
that got very unmanageable so we started

514
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,120
using Vector right it's a web-based GUI

515
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,440
it basically collects all that

516
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,419
information

517
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,820
um quick concept so you have an

518
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,320
assessment you can start the assessment

519
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,660
you have a campaign which is a group of

520
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,700
tests right under the assessment and

521
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,679
then all your test cases and these are

522
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,240
your attack techniques

523
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,980
so it basically organizes all this

524
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,299
information for you

525
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,039
I'm going to forward this and here's

526
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,280
where we start our actual purple team

527
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,679
in Vector we can create a new assessment

528
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,320
a new campaign that's the uh the cool

529
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,020
little GUI window where you you actually

530
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,240
enter your attack technique

531
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,340
and you know start documenting that the

532
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,960
left side is your red team the the right

533
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,780
side is your blue team

534
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,660
right here I'm using a uh I'm going I'm

535
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,720
going yeah so a few years ago 20 20 21

536
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,840
uh ubiquity had an Insider uh incident

537
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,780
where an Insider employee uh was

538
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,280
basically impersonating an attacker

539
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,280
right and they used a they they were

540
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,740
managing an AWS account and one of the

541
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,720
things that they did to cover their

542
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,120
tracks is they set a life cycle rule in

543
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,179
their AWS policy to delete any logs

544
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,640
after one day right so there's an attack

545
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,080
technique for that and if you wanted to

546
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,280
see what that looked like you could use

547
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,960
Stratus to kind of run that attacks for

548
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,220
this example that's exactly what I'm

549
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,840
using

550
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,280
um and there it is I kind of highlighted

551
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,360
it right there so I ran that attack

552
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,299
using uh Stratus I go over to cloudtrail

553
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:49,679
I'm using just cloudtrail for this

554
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,640
example

555
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,440
and that's what that activity would look

556
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,160
like I have the um the API the lifecycle

557
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,260
configuration there's you know some of

558
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,580
the parameters that are that are part of

559
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,340
it and the expiration date is set to one

560
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,200
right so that's the activity that I'm

561
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,000
interested in so when I share that uh

562
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,320
when I share that with the blue team or

563
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,000
The Blue Team actually finds that that's

564
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,740
what they would be looking for from

565
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,660
there they can obviously create an alert

566
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,980
or you know document it

567
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,919
so here I walk through some of the steps

568
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,299
that you can have your red team and your

569
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,700
blue team kind of uh go through as part

570
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,679
as part of the exercise

571
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,240
one of the cool things about vectors

572
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,799
once you get done with your test cases

573
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,840
you get this nice little Report with you

574
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,340
know pie charts and graphs and all that

575
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,780
that can kind of help your executive or

576
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,700
your leadership kind of tell what your

577
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,440
progress is how you you know how the

578
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,820
team's improving running these exercises

579
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,679
right here we failed I ran three test

580
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,120
cases and none of them were detected

581
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,140
Lessons Learned

582
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,460
that's where you kind of start talking

583
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,900
about all right what worked what didn't

584
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,120
work let's go back through it um you

585
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,500
know it's and it's all through iteration

586
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,059
right the more iterations you have the

587
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,080
better you get at these things

588
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:58,260
um

589
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,299
yeah conclusion so as you're going

590
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,100
through it I mean these are some of the

591
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,539
questions that you want to ask too is

592
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,280
like you know is this part of the you

593
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,799
want to look at what normal behavior is

594
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,720
compared to abnormal

595
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,000
you know so that's one of the main

596
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,440
takeaways as well too is you can start

597
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,960
looking at historical activity in your

598
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,640
in your organizations compared to some

599
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,679
of these test cases look to see if it's

600
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,320
if it's normal legit traffic or if it's

601
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,419
you know abnormal you start doing some

602
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,919
threat hunting as well from there too

603
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,240
okay and I just list some references up

604
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,860
here for anyone that's interested in

605
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,000
kind of you know doing some purple

606
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,440
teaming with it I know I ran out of time

607
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,820
I kind of rushed it a little bit at the

608
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,919
end uh now that I think about it this

609
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,120
could have definitely been a good

610
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,460
Workshop as well too so

611
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,740
oh awesome awesome yeah thank you

612
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,220
give me some good questions

613
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,460
so let's assume um

614
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,379
[Music]

615
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,760
that that's an awesome question no it's

616
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,400
not it's in in reality it's not right

617
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,440
it's if you have an S3 buck and it has

618
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,419
certain policies in there certain roles

619
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:22,740
and permissions that you know certain

620
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,200
groups can access or not access or

621
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,140
public it's not it doesn't do that the

622
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,320
idea with Stratus is that it recreates

623
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,600
the infrastructure and attacks it so

624
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,220
that you can see what that behavior

625
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,539
looks like

626
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,220
right so you're collecting a lot of that

627
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,220
activity but you as uh you know as a

628
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,960
defender or as even as a red team

629
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,220
operator those are the questions that

630
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,120
you ask

631
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,260
because that's what we've been asking

632
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,700
now we've been finding a lot of this

633
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,340
ourselves as like hey is this part of

634
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,480
the process this part of the business

635
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,280
process you know like this doesn't look

636
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,260
right why are these you know should we

637
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,780
have these permissions you know open to

638
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,520
the public like you know exactly like

639
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,380
what you're asking you know so that's

640
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,700
that's where it kind of comes in really

641
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,580
handy great question though thank you

642
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,159
anyone else

643
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,080
come on ask me something

644
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,299
since I know people always want to know

645
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,820
about the spend associated with creating

646
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,039
Cloud resources does Stratus have some

647
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,380
way to trap lands you know we were

648
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,299
running these exercises over some period

649
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:25,080
of time would a customer or executive

650
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,179
know okay how much is it going to cost

651
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,880
me to spin up and run these these Target

652
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,159
resources for a certain time yeah no

653
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,840
that's a great question too it doesn't

654
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,159
it doesn't that's why I kind of

655
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:37,020
introduced Vector as sort of being that

656
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,419
that sort of documentation tool when we

657
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,980
initially started like just putting all

658
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,360
this stuff in spreadsheets right and we

659
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,159
were realizing that it was just too much

660
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,039
data to collect not only that but

661
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,840
for a lot of these different so right

662
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,520
