1
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:06,199
think of Jefferson Airplane White Rabbit

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,880
1967. let's take you back I've got the

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,019
lyrics here

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,120
one pill makes you larger one pill makes

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,079
you small and uh yeah let's take Ken's

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,300
hand and let let him lead us down the

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,960
rabbit hole

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,160
okay uh so uh yeah my name is Ken Weston

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,560
I live here in Portland Oregon uh I want

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,820
to thank besides for having me it's

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,680
quite an honor to actually be asked to

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,860
Keynote here I've been born and raised

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,840
here in Portland I'm going to be talking

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,460
about going down the rabbit hole and

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,660
I'll tell you what that means in just a

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,100
little bit but I am an organ native I

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,539
actually grew up without the internet so

18
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,760
that tells you that how old I am

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,100
um uh I actually didn't get really

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,379
involved in computers until late

21
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,020
probably high school or so really I

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,340
actually have some learning disabilities

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,640
one of them was dysgraphia so I I was

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,280
raised a lot um well with schools I

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,140
didn't do so well I always thought I was

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,600
really stupid but once I was actually

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,040
diagnosed and they actually identify

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,840
what it was I was able to get access to

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,700
computers and all of a sudden I felt

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,680
like I had a superpower I was always

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,180
struggling with how to communicate

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,040
things like that and now using computers

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,159
I was doing really well I was able to do

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,680
a lot of writing I had a lot to say I

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,840
ended up going to college I went to

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,759
Lewis and Clark I got an English degree

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,100
because I loved writing I took all the

38
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,420
free classes that they had at the time

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,920
around this thing called the internet

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,680
that was starting to be a big deal so I

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,600
learned how to build web pages I got

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,000
really excited about this and started to

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,180
really like get into technology my first

44
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,799
job out of college was actually the sake

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,780
Brewery

46
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,340
where I actually ended up not just

47
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,540
working in The Tasting Room but I

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,280
actually built an online store to sell

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,979
rice wine things like that then I went

50
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,420
to work for a startup and things like

51
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,939
that I even ended up working at Pacific

52
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,799
University where I was on their first

53
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,780
webmaster I also ended up being an

54
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,060
adject instructor a nice thing about

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,560
being there is that I got to take all

56
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,179
the free classes I wanted so I took all

57
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:10,800
the computer science courses I possibly

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,080
could I then transferred and got a

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,879
master's degree in Internet systems

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,560
development

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,319
um uh and then I went to work and a lot

62
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,000
of startups and things I was doing a lot

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,379
of web development started getting more

64
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,020
into web administrator uh started doing

65
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,760
a web application development things

66
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,500
like that and that's when I started

67
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,300
getting involved in security

68
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,160
um and so I'll start to talk a little

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,319
bit about that and how I kind of fell

70
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,520
down the rabbit hole in a lot of

71
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,620
respects when it came to security and

72
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,180
how it led to other rabbit holes along

73
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,879
the way so the idea here is I'm going to

74
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,720
talk about some of the

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,160
investigations I've been part of how

76
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,379
that led to development of Technologies

77
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,780
and things like that and really how it

78
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,000
kind of led to my career and where I am

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,560
today

80
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,620
um I'm also my hobbies I play guitar I

81
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,819
play in a band called sevilla's ghost

82
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,860
here in Portland sometimes we uh we play

83
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,019
McMenamins and things like that I'm also

84
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,580
a record hoarder

85
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,319
um and uh yeah if you guys ever want to

86
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,060
jam let me know

87
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,159
so what do I mean by rabbit holes

88
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,319
um when I look at security particularly

89
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,659
I think some of us particularly with

90
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,400
like ADHD we understand what a rabbit

91
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,159
hole is uh we have some challenges when

92
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,319
it comes to organization and things like

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,959
that but when you get us hyper focused

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,379
on something we don't stop we do not

95
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,540
give up right and sometimes that can be

96
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,459
a good thing sometimes that can be a bad

97
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,080
thing and it can also set you up for

98
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,780
Burnout also on the other side of that I

99
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,099
think it's also this effing around and

100
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,840
finding out it's experimenting it's

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,180
about trying new things and I think what

102
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,760
really attracted me security was that

103
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,099
ability to be able to innovate to be

104
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,480
able to go down these rabbit holes to be

105
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,799
able to try new things you can't

106
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,620
necessarily do to utilize technology in

107
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,540
ways that they weren't meant to be

108
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,298
utilized and even break it at some point

109
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,260
so I kind of pulled a few quotes because

110
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,700
uh you know going down the rabbit hole

111
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,680
the idiom the metaphor actually comes

112
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,659
from Alice in Wonderland uh with a great

113
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,760
story uh you know we talk about going

114
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,260
down rabbit holes

115
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,640
um and it's interesting is like

116
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,500
sometimes I wake up and I'm like how the

117
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,480
heck did I get here and then I realized

118
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,519
you know it wasn't just me alone like

119
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,680
what I was able to actually rely on a

120
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,079
community and um we always talk about

121
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,840
the the caterpillar uh or you know we're

122
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,820
all mad here right I think everyone is

123
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,400
doing security they're a little bit I

124
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,479
think a little bit different than you

125
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,220
might find in other areas of technology

126
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,340
and other um in other sectors as well

127
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,020
um and uh I think that Rings true for

128
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,120
for most of us

129
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,199
um so

130
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,419
um a while back when I was doing uh

131
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,820
security I ended up having a startup I I

132
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,699
got involved in um riding some usb-based

133
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,139
Trojans I was really interested in it

134
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,400
and I was trying to find ways to

135
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,080
actually utilize this technology for

136
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,120
good for actually tracking stolen

137
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,759
devices this led me down to multiple

138
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,040
rabbit holes I ended up developing

139
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,380
technology to track USB devices laptops

140
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,419
mobile phones even started getting into

141
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,900
tracking stolen cameras by looking at

142
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,820
exif data that's embedded in images and

143
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,800
building search engines that were around

144
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,680
that I actually presented this at Defcon

145
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,860
it was Defcon 23. it was kind of my

146
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,180
first time actually presenting a big

147
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,880
conference scared the crap out of me but

148
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,220
I'm glad I did it but of course after I

149
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,419
did that when I was talking about these

150
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,759
recoveries um I even got a lot of media

151
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,500
exposure so media exposure that wasn't

152
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,660
so good sometimes being called a

153
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,000
professional cyber stalker being called

154
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,400
to realize Mr Robot you can imagine how

155
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,960
that puts a nice big Target on your back

156
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,660
for doxing and things like that at

157
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,820
um but this was great I actually ended

158
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,919
up becoming a talking head I've worked

159
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,380
at tripwire I had the opportunity to

160
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,440
talk to the media a lot I think even

161
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
like Travis here refers to me as a media

162
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,039
 I think he's just jealous because

163
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,259
he's always stealing my slides

164
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,600
um but you know it was a it was it was

165
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,160
actually a really good thing I was able

166
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,139
to get out there the startup that I had

167
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,940
it failed and it was probably one of the

168
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,320
lowest points of my life I had a really

169
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,720
hard time but once I I kind of came out

170
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,919
of it and I was going out in the sector

171
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,320
I realized just how much I learned in

172
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,419
that process so I'm going to walk you

173
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,680
guys through some of the investigations

174
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,500
I worked on and talk about how you know

175
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,419
how I think about running investigations

176
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,100
and also how some of those

177
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,340
investigations led to new Innovations

178
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,539
so when you think about doing

179
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,580
investigations it's it's never just like

180
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,440
one alert like if you're doing instant

181
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,940
response you know you can't just rely on

182
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,500
one alert you have to be able to Pivot

183
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,199
maybe you're using Splunk or other other

184
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,759
data sources

185
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,259
um it's always going to be gathering a

186
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,180
lot of different um sources if you ever

187
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,580
look at any of the sort of murder shows

188
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,139
or any detective shows you always see

189
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,520
these walls where they're drawing lines

190
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,660
between

191
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,620
um you know the pieces of evidence

192
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,419
they're called crazy walls appropriately

193
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,639
named and that's really how A lot of

194
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,100
these investigations start you may start

195
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,780
with one piece of information but you're

196
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,840
going to Pivot and then it's really not

197
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,520
necessarily technical exercise it's

198
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,039
really a exercise of creativity to be

199
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,139
able to identify and make more sense of

200
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,880
that particular alert

201
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,139
does anyone know who this guy is

202
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,020
very close yes forensics this is the OG

203
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,199
hacker when it comes to uh criminals his

204
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,120
name is Edmund lecard um he's the

205
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,400
grandfather of forensic science he

206
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,020
actually developed a lot of like

207
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,819
forensic techniques even fingerprints

208
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,560
that we utilize today some of the

209
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,500
techniques he actually pioneered he was

210
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,360
referred to as the Sherlock Holmes of uh

211
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,240
in France this was in like I think he

212
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,360
died in 1966 or so but he really

213
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,919
developed a lot of the techniques and he

214
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,380
had this concept this sort of Axiom is

215
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,139
every contact leaves the trace and I was

216
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,060
reading about him and I was like holy

217
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,759
crap this is it his idea was that this

218
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,620
is dealing with physical crimes where

219
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,300
when you commit a crime you leave

220
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,340
something and you take something with

221
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,139
you and I was thinking about this when

222
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,840
it comes to investigations I'd say every

223
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,479
digital contact also leaves a trace it's

224
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,099
just a matter of do we have the the

225
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,319
mechanisms to detect it do we have the

226
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,840
ways to actually archive or sorry search

227
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,819
for that data and you'll kind of see

228
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,440
that as we go through some of these

229
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,880
investigations

230
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,460
so I was working for a company before I

231
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,900
was doing web development I was sort of

232
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,660
a one-man web Army I was my only

233
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,280
experience with security at that point

234
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,500
was securing a web server I was

235
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,539
responsible for basically securing a

236
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,520
lamp stack

237
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,900
but the company I worked for started

238
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,039
building a product that would actually

239
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,219
block USB flash drives this became a big

240
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,740
issue with things like auto run Windows

241
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,260
XP things like that it was becoming a

242
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,120
really big problem where you know forget

243
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,799
trying to hack a network if I can

244
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,539
actually plug a flash drive into a

245
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,279
computer it's a heck of a lot easier for

246
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,560
me to compromise that Network also

247
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,120
there's tools that would actually allow

248
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,940
me to slurp data I can grab all sorts of

249
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,140
information from it and so they wanted

250
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,820
to be able to block it and I got really

251
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,140
interested in this they started looking

252
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,180
into some of these tools and I was like

253
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,320
this is neat and I started actually

254
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,880
playing with them and actually started

255
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,560
writing some of my own and I was like

256
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm going to build a website to raise

257
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,360
awareness around this so I I was called

258
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,680
usbhacks.com I put it up and actually

259
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
started putting up some of these tools

260
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,399
and the idea here was that you could

261
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,540
download them and you could play with

262
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,820
them and to raise awareness anyway that

263
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,620
was the first time the FBI contacted me

264
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,839
but uh once I explained to them what I

265
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,279
was trying to do in the intent you know

266
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,420
this is kind of what we're talking about

267
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,399
with security research now you know you

268
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,040
know hacking is not a crime and uh when

269
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,839
they started realizing my intent and in

270
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,100
some cases I actually even helped them

271
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,720
in some cases where I had some really

272
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,820
weird people that were approaching me

273
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,440
um in one case there was a guy that was

274
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
approached me that

275
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,560
um uh looked like he had a physical

276
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,160
access to a facility and he was asking

277
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,140
for some specific payloads in asking if

278
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,000
I would help I actually sent that over

279
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,680
to the FBI because this was really fishy

280
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,899
come to find out yes he was a well-known

281
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,420
bad guy uh bad hacker in in the Middle

282
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,700
East and um they they thanked me for it

283
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,860
so anyway check out the FBI off my back

284
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,399
for a little while

285
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,040
so uh next idea was how do I turn that

286
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,540
into something that's actually useful I

287
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,220
started playing with it and at the time

288
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,480
I was actually working on my Master's

289
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,339
Degree and I was like you know I was

290
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,320
playing with this and um uh you know

291
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,180
messing with friends sending them flash

292
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,500
drives that we do all sorts of nasty

293
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,060
things to their computer pop-ups things

294
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,060
like that direct them to fun websites

295
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,980
um and so I said well what if I did this

296
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,740
for theft recovery so I built a little a

297
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,320
friendly Trojan that went executed it

298
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,760
would hijack the computer it's connected

299
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,920
to gather user information and then it

300
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,560
would send it to a Mothership and I

301
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,000
tested this out I was like I'm going to

302
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,540
put it on dig.com so um who anyone know

303
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,980
dig.com

304
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,480
all right for all the kids out there

305
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,880
dig.com is like uh Reddit for old people

306
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,440
okay

307
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,079
um uh so uh and the idea was you know I

308
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,220
just I wanted to get a few people to

309
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,500
test it and uh it ended up being on the

310
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,820
homepage of dig

311
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,560
um and I ended up having like 20 000

312
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,360
devices

313
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,800
um of being registered I could I can't

314
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,779
believe the server actually held up

315
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,940
um but I also utilized that when they're

316
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,380
running the agents I was gathering

317
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,880
information about the devices that they

318
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,560
were connected so I actually created

319
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,300
this huge database of all of the

320
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,920
potential devices that I could

321
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,660
compromise with on this these

322
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,279
executables

323
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,200
um and uh we even started getting some

324
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,240
recoveries it was really interesting

325
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,740
um you know we were covering iPods we

326
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,519
were covering all these different

327
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,500
devices and this is the information we

328
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,579
were able to gather it was really simple

329
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,500
it was just you know internal Network

330
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,839
information IP address getting some

331
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,700
geoip location

332
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,899
um the username and things like that

333
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,579
which would be really helpful but you

334
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:33,779
know I really wanted to limit it I

335
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,399
didn't want to you know go go nasty like

336
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,720
with some of these things I could have

337
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,180
you know gotten credentials and done a

338
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,920
lot more malicious things but the idea

339
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,899
here was just what do I need to be able

340
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,579
to track on that device and where it is

341
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,680
if it got stolen

342
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,779
and then I had another case where it got

343
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,459
a lot more interesting

344
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,040
um we had a professor who had his

345
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,140
dissertation that was taken off of a

346
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,940
flash drive from his desk

347
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,040
um and it was this is a time where I was

348
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,779
like okay I'll see if I can help I

349
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,579
started looking at the data and we were

350
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,800
getting connections from uh an ISP

351
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,940
that's not really helpful it gives me

352
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,040
the IP address but unless I get like a

353
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,019
subpoena from law enforcement to go in

354
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,459
and actually get the address and all

355
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,200
that it's not going to be useful and

356
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,459
that could take anywhere from weeks to

357
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,560
months if you can get it at all but then

358
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,880
we started getting connections from a

359
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,980
computer lab um in a uh at the

360
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,019
University of North Texas what's

361
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,640
interesting is we were able to actually

362
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,740
identify a specific computer lab just

363
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,320
from the internal Network information

364
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,060
and then we cut talking to campus

365
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,040
security we realized that they'd

366
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,779
actually put in cameras and some key

367
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,220
cars because they recently had a bunch

368
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,079
of laptop thefts so we were able to

369
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,880
correlate the time stamps that we had on

370
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,620
the USB connection uh the the internet

371
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,500
connections from the USB Trojan to the

372
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,139
the key swipes as well as the camera and

373
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,639
we're able to identify who is in the

374
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,560
room at the time and they were able to

375
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,540
get a recovery so this is kind of those

376
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,980
crazy well types of things where you

377
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,959
start looking at not just the that data

378
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,279
source you start to look at other data

379
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,779
sources that are available for your

380
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,360
investigation and they ended up getting

381
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,279
it back I'm not sure if the kid actually

382
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,139
stole it or they took it but the

383
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,399
important thing is that he he got his

384
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,740
dissertation information back and also

385
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,440
another reason why you need backups

386
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,260
and then uh I was getting a lot of press

387
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,820
with some of this stuff and I was

388
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,639
approached by FLIR and they make very

389
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,320
high-end thermal imaging cameras now

390
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,360
these cameras cost anywhere from three

391
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,680
thousand to three hundred thousand

392
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,260
dollars and I ended up selling idea this

393
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,940
was one of my my bigger deals and this

394
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,320
is actually around the time I quit my

395
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,000
job and started focusing on this full

396
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,300
time I was able to not only build the

397
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,700
Trojans because we had a challenge with

398
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,399
this because if it wrote to an SD card

399
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,500
if you take the SD card out great you

400
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,480
put a new one in then we don't have the

401
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
agent so this is where we actually

402
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,860
installed something in the firmware that

403
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,420
would check to see if the agent was

404
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,160
enabled if it wasn't then it would

405
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,620
rewrite it and we're able to get access

406
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,660
to it what's interesting with this too

407
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,360
is that it wasn't just used for theft

408
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,100
recovery they had issues with export

409
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,079
controls some of these devices are not

410
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:02,399
allowed to be in certain countries and

411
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,380
they had situations where they were

412
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,519
being sold to some of these countries

413
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,200
they were showing up in Iran for example

414
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,480
and so they couldn't tell me all the

415
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,700
details but they did utilize this to

416
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,260
identify a distributor that might have

417
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,320
been selling places they shouldn't and

418
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,399
you'll notice that there's this little

419
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,519
cat here I actually disguised the the um

420
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,660
the Trojan on the on the card as my cat

421
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,500
they gave me some of the thermal engine

422
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,180
cameras I got to play with them and

423
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,959
that's my cat and hobby

424
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,720
so then further down the rabbit hole I

425
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,279
was like okay this is all fun and all

426
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,120
but

427
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,860
um well let's go after Stephanie that

428
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,180
actually has a lot more value at the

429
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,060
time laptops well at the time laptops

430
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,860
all had most of them were coming out

431
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,000
with web cameras and it wasn't

432
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,800
necessarily being utilized I think there

433
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,839
was one Mac developer that was utilizing

434
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,120
that for uh for some things but

435
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,920
um you know it's that's helpful but you

436
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,240
don't have all the information that you

437
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,560
need

438
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,880
um I though at the time there was the

439
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,680
iPhone that came out and I was

440
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,820
interested because the first iPhone

441
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,220
didn't have a GPS chip it was able to

442
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,740
get location and it was using um a Wi-Fi

443
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,320
for a location and I dug deeper into it

444
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,940
and I contacted the company that had

445
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,320
that technology called Skyhook Wireless

446
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
and I was able to actually put that into

447
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,519
the product so this is the first time we

448
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,800
actually had a laptop a theft recovery

449
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,420
product that when you activate tracking

450
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,920
it will gather the photo of the person

451
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,899
that's using your computer it would also

452
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,220
gather other information about the

453
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,660
network and then we'll also get the

454
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,579
location of that device and it was

455
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:30,079
accurate within five to ten meters

456
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,000
and at the time I didn't want to have to

457
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,680
secure a server and I was also really

458
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,959
concerned about privacy because I didn't

459
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,699
I wanted to make sure that if we're

460
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,079
going to gather people's photos and

461
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,420
things like that that you know we have

462
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,579
that secured uh we also I was worried

463
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,560
about what if we get hacked and all of a

464
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,699
sudden now someone's photos are

465
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,279
compromised so instead of me taking that

466
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,959
on that liability I integrate with

467
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,060
Flickr so you would integrate with your

468
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,100
Flickr account and then that was only

469
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,720
thing I tracked is if you had tracking

470
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,199
activated offer on we then over time we

471
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,579
we modified that and we did have a

472
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,440
central server to control all this when

473
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,000
I actually got some funding and I was

474
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,699
able to hire real developers to um to

475
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,579
help build that architecture out

476
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,199
we actually got our first recovery it

477
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,180
was in Brooklyn New York

478
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,800
um uh this was really interesting it was

479
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,139
a a guy he had an iMac and he had a

480
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,220
bunch of camera equipment that were

481
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,800
stolen from his house and I got a call

482
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,079
from a New York detective and he was

483
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,519
really frustrated he was like he was

484
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,139
kind of mad about these types of things

485
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,060
because it was another company that was

486
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,160
doing theft recovery and it's a it's a

487
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,480
lot of paperwork he had to file because

488
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,540
it's iip address you have to get the go

489
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,759
to the care the ISP you have to you know

490
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,380
write all this information validate it

491
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,880
I'm going to take anywhere from two

492
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,220
weeks to several months and he was like

493
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,480
frustrated he was like this is a waste

494
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,620
of my time and I'm like no I'm getting

495
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,720
location we have Wi-Fi location look

496
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,240
just take a photo of this photo and then

497
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,920
go look around that area and ask people

498
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,079
around and then of course he told me not

499
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,579
no not to you know tell him how to do

500
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,500
his job or whatever but he finally did

501
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,100
it and and sure enough they found the

502
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,420
laptop it was in the back of a tattoo

503
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,459
parlor this is the back of an office and

504
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,540
if you see there's a bunch of other

505
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,760
really cool stuff like mixers and audio

506
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,980
equipment they went in and they found

507
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,260
all sorts of on property and this is

508
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,880
where I started realizing that this is

509
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,140
how I can actually get law enforcement

510
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,640
to care they don't care about the

511
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,020
individuals or laptops but if I can

512
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,780
unveil larger organized crime Rings if I

513
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,400
can find other fencing operations and I

514
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,799
can find these larger things that are

515
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,799
being done then that's when they become

516
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,100
the hero and and we started doing a lot

517
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,459
more of that

518
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,039
so this was a really fun case there was

519
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,500
a bunch of uh schools in Portland here

520
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,660
that were getting hit repeatedly it was

521
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,919
the weirdest thing like they would have

522
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,780
a bunch of laptops stolen they would

523
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,280
replace them and then a week or two

524
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,860
later they would be stolen again and

525
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,660
they couldn't figure out why how it was

526
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,660
happening and so we decided let's give

527
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,600
them some bait laptops so they they put

528
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,220
them out and sure enough within two

529
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,500
weeks they started they got stolen and

530
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,360
we started getting connections and you

531
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,419
can see there's a photo of the fellow

532
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,620
and the detective went out there it was

533
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,500
actually traced to Vancouver and the the

534
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,320
I told slain the police officer what

535
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,640
what their detective what you want to do

536
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,080
just you know it's within 10 to 20

537
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,059
meters he goes there and knocks on the

538
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,100
door and the guy that works on his roof

539
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,720
answers the door and he's like you don't

540
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,100
know what you're talking about Ken like

541
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,840
this is I know this guy you know you're

542
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,360
wasting our time I got mad so I drove

543
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,460
out there to Vancouver I'm sitting there

544
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,539
and I was actually scanning the Wi-Fi

545
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:34,679
network to make sure that the

546
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:35,760
information we were gathering was

547
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,799
correct now one of the Wi-Fi networks

548
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,140
that was on on there was it was said

549
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,480
Russia and then I looked over and there

550
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,299
was like where the detective had gone it

551
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,160
was a duplex he had gone to the one on

552
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,360
the left and the one on the right

553
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,740
there's a car right in front of the

554
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,720
driveway with this giant Russian pride

555
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,940
bumper sticker

556
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,100
so I'm I'm there and I'm actually I had

557
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,320
my laptop open and I swear the guy

558
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,700
actually walks out the door and he looks

559
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,440
at me and I'm like an idiot on my laptop

560
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,880
with this huge antenna sticking out of

561
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,720
my car

562
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,700
and I'm just like actually I'm like

563
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,679
acting like I'm lost like oh I'm just

564
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,120
looking for directions or whatever I

565
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,260
don't think you suspect anything but I

566
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,520
told the detectives they finally came

567
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,419
out

568
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,580
um and uh and they said they they ended

569
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,960
up getting them um I thought I was going

570
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,280
to have to testify this was kind of a

571
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,140
scary time I found out these guys were

572
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,520
um pretty bad news

573
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,720
um he even like the guy even told me

574
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,039
it's like yeah it's not that guy you got

575
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,480
to worry about it um he's actually

576
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,799
friends with the guy across the street

577
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,720
like he's part of his gang

578
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,400
um the where you have your car parked

579
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,260
right now in front of his house he's

580
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,360
really bad news but they they ended up

581
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,400
um uh busting there was like six or

582
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,140
seven people that were involved I didn't

583
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,480
have to be involved in to testify they

584
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,160
listed me as an anonymous whatever

585
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,799
source and they got them all to turn on

586
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,179
each other thinking that they had all

587
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,880
ratted each other out so I was I was

588
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,660
relieved

589
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,340
uh we had another interesting case where

590
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,900
um this one was this is where I started

591
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,700
getting really a lot more into the OS

592
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,260
inside of things on the investigations

593
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,600
uh we had a laptop that was stolen and I

594
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,860
didn't get any connections for like two

595
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,600
weeks I was like ah crap they probably

596
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,220
reformatted the drive or sold it for

597
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,960
parts or something like that but then we

598
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,160
started getting Connections in Missouri

599
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,080
I'm like what the hell and we were

600
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,520
getting tons of photos there was this

601
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,620
guy named Victor it was really nice of

602
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,520
him because he actually changed the

603
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,320
username on the computer to his full

604
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,840
name so I had first name last name it

605
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,760
was great so when I looked him up I

606
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,080
found all kinds of stuff he was a big

607
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,380
car nut so Scions really he really liked

608
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,600
those cars he's only forums and so he

609
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,400
posted photos of his car so he also had

610
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,039
a license plate number on his Myspace

611
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,840
and then on eBay he was a big eBay

612
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,520
seller and he was selling used car parts

613
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,720
so you can kind of get an idea of the

614
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,539
business working with the police this

615
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,400
was the first case we actually provided

616
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,020
this to district attorney and they said

617
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,580
holy crap you have so much evidence here

618
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,140
like even if they don't have the laptop

619
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,059
we can still bust them for possession of

620
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,280
stolen property he ended up selling the

621
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,900
laptop in a stolen bike to his friend

622
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,240
Omar I found out that he actually

623
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,400
received the bike and the laptop from

624
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,320
his father who was actually part of this

625
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,799
group what they do is they they there

626
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,720
was two another Russian organized crime

627
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,240
group they they work in Missouri and

628
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,980
then Portland they basically share

629
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,200
stolen property because if you get

630
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,220
something stolen here in Portland

631
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,360
where's the first place you're going to

632
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,220
look Craigslist locally so what they did

633
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,720
was they they still bunch of property

634
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,640
loaded up into a white truck driving to

635
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,500
Missouri exchange goods and then that's

636
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,000
how they're able to defend some of this

637
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,799
this stuff so this was a really

638
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,120
interesting case we started getting a

639
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,679
better understanding of how some of

640
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,760
these these groups are actually

641
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,720
operating

642
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,580
it also worked internationally

643
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,580
um we had a friend Skye Alberto who's in

644
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,320
Brazil he was a Veterinary student he

645
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,419
was in a car with a friend they were

646
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,460
held at gunpoint told to get out of the

647
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,500
car his friend was punched and knocked

648
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,720
down to the ground and they took off

649
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,460
with the car with his laptop in the back

650
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,679
seat we were able to get connections we

651
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,900
were getting photos on the Brazilian

652
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,280
police at the time they were they work

653
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,679
closely with us because they uh I guess

654
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:53,880
these guys were involved in a lot of

655
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,400
these cases and I think their their one

656
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,780
person was in the hospital he almost

657
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,780
died and that they had attacked so it

658
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,039
was kind of nice like we're not just

659
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,080
solving you know your cyber crimes and

660
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,400
things like that we're also helping to

661
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,539
solve physical crimes

662
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,679
so again further down the rabbit hole

663
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,419
like I was like what else more can we do

664
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,280
at the time smartphones are becoming

665
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,200
much more prominent and what I found is

666
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,340
that people don't really care too much

667
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,840
about the value of the device itself

668
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,039
what they really cared about was the

669
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,299
data

670
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,100
um but I was really nervous again I

671
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,419
didn't want to like

672
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:28,860
um or you know back up people's photos

673
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,600
or contact information things like that

674
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,340
so we actually built a way that you

675
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,720
would actually put an encryption key on

676
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,120
your phone only you knew it and then

677
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,100
when you activate tracking or whatever

678
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,559
you could download this a file and then

679
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,299
you would decrypt it with that key so I

680
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,740
never had the decryption key there's no

681
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,659
way I could view anyone's photos and

682
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:46,980
this is helpful too like if law

683
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,960
enforcement came to us and said hey we

684
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,460
need this person's information I'm like

685
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,919
well here's the The Blob of data you're

686
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,120
going to have to go to them to get the

687
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,159
encryption key and that provide a little

688
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,900
bit of Peace of Mind when we were doing

689
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,080
this but

690
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,940
we had some interesting recoveries and

691
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,220
I'm gonna I think I got a video here so

692
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,320
I can stop talking for a minute

693
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,419
or that's helping track them down

694
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,580
NewsChannel 8 said teachout spent the

695
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,200
past two days with police and

696
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,200
investigators on the trail of swiped

697
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,480
cell phones he's live outside the

698
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,980
Washington Square Mall where the theft

699
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,659
took place at

700
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:23,520
well the managers of the Sprint Store

701
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,080
here at the Washington Square Mall

702
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,539
behind me say they're very confident

703
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,000
that tracking software developed only

704
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,700
miles away from here and put onto their

705
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,460
demo phones will lead to an arrest

706
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,580
uh this is a 500 phone this ends up

707
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,520
being a 450 phone two empty display

708
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,140
cradles Are All That Remains after

709
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,419
someone stole two demo cell phones from

710
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,740
the Sprint store at Washington Square

711
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,720
Mall on Saturday moments after

712
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,460
surveillance video caught the theft on

713
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,679
tape employees initiated tracking

714
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,840
software installed on the stolen phones

715
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,059
they were able to not only find the GPS

716
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,820
location of the individuals that took

717
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,000
them but also we've been able to uh to

718
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,559
monitor any activity that happens in the

719
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,960
phone that activity turned out to be

720
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,880
pictures someone took shortly after the

721
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,100
phones were stolen Tigard police admit

722
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,840
It's A Brave New World when pictures

723
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,120
taken on cell phones can be told to send

724
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,980
back pictures once they're stolen and

725
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,980
that has not only piqued the interest of

726
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,280
our investigators but in essence appears

727
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,919
at this point could be very credible

728
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,900
information for us to follow up on the

729
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,159
Portland creator of the software

730
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,500
tracking the theft says police are on

731
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,820
the right track if they're not the

732
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,140
thieves they definitely know who stole

733
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,000
it and if you look over the head of this

734
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,799
man you'll see in the window an organ

735
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,380
temporary permit Philip this is Ed with

736
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,240
the help of a gadget track investigator

737
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,460
on the phone we tracked the stolen phone

738
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,140
signal to this Vancouver apartment

739
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,299
complex there we found the exact

740
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,260
temporary permit and

741
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,659
hi a young woman who told us off camera

742
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,120
a man she called Peter had sent this

743
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,280
photo to her Saturday evening but says

744
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,460
she knew nothing about the phones hi my

745
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,900
name is we tracked the second cell phone

746
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,179
signal to this duplex about eight blocks

747
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:09,120
away you don't have an a Samsung Epic

748
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,640
phone in this location

749
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,380
police were here yesterday looking for

750
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,559
it

751
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,280
we're back live now outside the

752
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,080
Washington Square Mall where we've just

753
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,539
obtained within the hour those DMV

754
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,120
records on that temporary permit tiger

755
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,799
police say they hope the men in the

756
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,320
pictures will contact them soon so they

757
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,140
can explain how their faces ended up on

758
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,539
a stolen cell phone back to you thank

759
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,640
you Ed teachout the contractor is

760
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,120
accused of overspraying anyway that was

761
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,440
um that was actually a lot of fun to

762
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,840
work on that particular case uh

763
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,720
um there were some challenges with it uh

764
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,020
some of the the GPS

765
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,620
coordinates that we're actually getting

766
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,600
sent back weren't very reliable but what

767
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,520
I did find was that we were able to get

768
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,520
the the images again the Sprint store

769
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,960
chain that actually had stalled this

770
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,580
they gave me the encryption key to go

771
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,580
ahead and decrypt the the images and I

772
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,960
found that there was a bunch of data

773
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,460
that was actually embedded in the images

774
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,320
that they were taking so those photos

775
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,059
actually had the GPS coordinates and

776
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,100
those were much more accurate that led

777
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,779
me down to another rabbit hole on exif

778
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:17,760
data but um one thing that uh nope

779
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,940
back in the slides that's helping track

780
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,760
but one thing I should say is that you

781
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,559
know this is an application that people

782
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,179
installed on their devices willingly

783
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:32,760
right so if you steal my device I have

784
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,200
the right to go ahead and I can activate

785
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,480
track and I can do that

786
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,760
um what's scary to me now is the

787
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,799
direction that this is gone

788
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,400
um

789
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,640
it's to a point now where we have a

790
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,559
commercial spyware vendors that are

791
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,840
providing technology that are leveraging

792
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,460
zero day vulnerabilities against their

793
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,260
citizens and this is I think is

794
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,820
something that should raise concern

795
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,340
that's helping

796
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,320
one example is the NSO group have you

797
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,000
all heard of Pegasus

798
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,440
okay

799
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,779
um so this is really worries me

800
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,580
um you know they these these companies

801
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,440
they'll say that hey these are uh we

802
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,820
only do it for terrorists people that

803
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,580
are criminals well who's a criminal

804
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,559
how do you define a criminal some of

805
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,140
these are being utilized um in in

806
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,640
countries where you have very uh

807
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,159
authoritative regimes this uh they're

808
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,720
deploying some of these Technologies to

809
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,460
people that they consider enemies that

810
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,260
are journalists that are dissidents and

811
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,539
things like that and I think this is uh

812
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:28,980
there's actually a case right now with

813
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,080
the the EU and the Pega committee that

814
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,960
are trying to control how we're

815
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,940
deploying some of the software the NSO

816
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,500
group is now blacklisted in the U.S

817
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,419
there's been a lot of disinformation

818
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,820
around this particular technology and

819
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,679
things like that I've been doing my part

820
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,020
to try to help to um to stop some of

821
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,659
this this information but what's really

822
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,400
interesting is that the community the

823
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,779
infosec communities really come together

824
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:55,020
to help stop this particular Threat by

825
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,539
in many ways but uh just something I

826
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,659
wanted to put as an aside uh but um kind

827
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,159
of go back to this I got really

828
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,740
interested in the exif data again um I

829
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,980
even built a tool if you go to exit.io

830
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,360
you can actually upload images and it'll

831
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,400
look for any um any valuable information

832
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,200
that I might be able to find

833
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,460
um in an image it'll look for GPS

834
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,080
coordinates it'll look for the make and

835
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,440
model of a camera and things like that

836
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,820
um so I got really interested in this

837
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,539
and I found that looking at maxif data a

838
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,799
lot of the high-end cameras were

839
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,179
actually embedding the make model and

840
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,039
the serial number of the camera and I

841
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,720
had this Theory well what if I was able

842
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,760
to create a database if I could get all

843
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,799
these different images and the serial

844
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,059
numbers and you could search for the

845
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,799
serial number of your camera and we'll

846
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,360
show you all the places online that we

847
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,740
found on that photo

848
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,320
uh our photos were taken by that camera

849
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,020
um it was um sort of an experiment I did

850
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,179
um we had uh I had like maybe a few

851
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:49,679
computers I was doing this on I was

852
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,720
trying to index all of Flickr for

853
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,460
example and I was just doing these

854
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,559
Python and PHP scripts and I was like

855
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,640
this is going to take forever it

856
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,200
probably take me like 10 years to mine

857
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,880
the whole thing but I had a friend that

858
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,620
had a startup and he had this thing

859
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,120
where they're doing it where it's

860
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,460
basically a legal botnet where it's kind

861
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,720
of like a study at home where

862
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,659
universities can provide their idle

863
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,900
computer labs to go ahead and we can

864
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,539
deploy you can put workloads to those

865
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:17,039
computer labs and it's a lot cheaper

866
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,779
than trying to go to the cloud so

867
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:20,100
experiment I think we had over a

868
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,419
thousand computers that were doing this

869
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,640
and I just basically deployed my shitty

870
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,500
python script I do have these Thousand

871
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,539
Ones and we're able to actually index

872
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:30,360
all of Flickr I also down was able to

873
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,919
index some other websites where I was

874
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,320
finding this data even Twitter I found

875
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,880
that even though you upload an image to

876
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,100
Twitter it will scrub that information

877
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,320
but I found for some reason a lot of the

878
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,720
profiles photos didn't have it so I was

879
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,640
finding these tiny little icons that how

880
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,440
GPS coordinates and things like that so

881
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,539
I was just bringing that in for um to

882
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,700
see what I could find but the idea here

883
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,200
was we did create this database and I

884
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,299
put it out there and people started

885
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,679
using it for free and holy crap it

886
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,500
worked this guy named John Heller

887
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,080
um he was on assignment for uh Getty

888
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,179
Images at the Egyptian Theater he was

889
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,919
talking to someone he turned around and

890
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,299
nine thousand dollars worth of camera

891
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,640
equipment was gone you heard about the

892
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,039
service that I built and he did a search

893
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,840
and it's important to point out this was

894
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,260
a year later

895
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,399
about a year later and uh

896
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,980
he uh found it uh we he found the image

897
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,659
on Flickr and then he found that that

898
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,520
account was also tied to a professional

899
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,279
photographer on Facebook who had photos

900
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,960
of all his professional camera gear and

901
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,399
there was this camera

902
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,860
um and so he uh the LAPD were involved

903
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,080
um and so what the cat what happened was

904
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,700
um the guy that stole it from him sold

905
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,220
it on Craigslist he then went and um

906
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,440
that person stole it on eBay and then

907
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,940
the police recovered it the police went

908
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,220
to the guy that got on eBay he had to

909
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,020
hire a lawyer he had to be able to prove

910
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,080
that he didn't steal it and he ended up

911
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,480
getting the money back from the seller

912
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,860
they trace it back to the guy on

913
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,419
Craigslist and the guy on Craigslist oh

914
00:30:57,419 --> 00:30:58,500
yeah I remember where I bought the

915
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,880
camera it was this apartment I still

916
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,140
have the address I have the text message

917
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,179
the police went there this a year later

918
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:04,679
they go to the apartment and they found

919
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,380
all sorts of stolen property right so I

920
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,760
just think this is interesting is that

921
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,760
the serial number of a camera that was

922
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,559
embedded in an image led to the

923
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,120
unveiling of this type of crime and I

924
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,740
always think about what other types of

925
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,539
of crimes can we solve if we have access

926
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:20,760
to that sort of thing so again these

927
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,960
sort of rabbit holes that we go down

928
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,580
right always think about that there's

929
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,260
always new Innovations and new ways that

930
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,200
we can help solve some of these problems

931
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,419
had another case where uh it was on

932
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:33,480
Craigslist this one uh the guy like uh

933
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,039
he was selling the camera he was going

934
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,880
to move

935
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,500
um and this guy came out there showed

936
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,059
him the cash goes out to the garage

937
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:40,799
pulls out the camera the guy knocks him

938
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,600
to the ground punches him takes off in

939
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,880
his car uh we we ended up tracing this

940
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,220
up to uh this one guy he was this DJ

941
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,260
what's interesting is I started

942
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,120
leveraging oscent and I started to find

943
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,679
all these other images and it was he

944
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:54,179
changed his cameras every month and he

945
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:55,740
advertises himself as a professional

946
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,960
photographer but it's interesting though

947
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,580
is too is he likes to take photos of

948
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,840
himself

949
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,299
um going over the like over 100 miles an

950
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,640
hour smoking weed on the freeway we had

951
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,460
GPS coordinates time stamps everything

952
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,779
provided that to law enforcement in this

953
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:10,980
case law enforcement didn't do anything

954
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,659
I tried everything I could I gave him

955
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,120
all the evidence that we had at the time

956
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,799
and uh yeah they they never got that one

957
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,779
back

958
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,480
um I was approached by Ice uh there's a

959
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,340
group that they do a child exploitation

960
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,440
investigations unit these people are

961
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,640
really cool some of the stuff that

962
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,020
they're doing where they're actually

963
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,000
looking at images like that are in a

964
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,860
hotel they're looking at the the curtain

965
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,179
patterns they're looking at the the bed

966
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,039
spread patterns and things like that and

967
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,220
they're able to identify what hotel that

968
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,020
is if it's a Best Western they can even

969
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,279
tell you the location and things like

970
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,080
that and they started doing that and

971
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,940
they they asked for Access and so I gave

972
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,340
them an API so the idea here is that

973
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,700
maybe Joe pervert is um uh he's taking

974
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,399
bad images and he's sharing them with

975
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,200
these sort of private networks and then

976
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,760
we he goes to Disneyland with his family

977
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,440
and takes photos using the same camera

978
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,600
if we're able to trace that that serial

979
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,580
camera matches that they might be able

980
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,039
to hopefully stop a crime they couldn't

981
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,720
tell me if it was actually utilized or

982
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,120
if it actually solved a crime but I like

983
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,720
to hope that it maybe did

984
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,580
so I mean kind of with all this stuff is

985
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,600
like I started thinking about all the

986
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,399
risks with this as well you think about

987
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:18,779
all the different pieces of data that

988
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,940
are out there um this was you know uh

989
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,640
you know it started like 15 years ago uh

990
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,200
started doing this stuff

991
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,120
um and this has only gotten worse um the

992
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,679
more we have tons of information that's

993
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,120
out there about us

994
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,380
um it's gotten to the point now where I

995
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,000
don't even consider doxing hacking

996
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,340
because all you need to get information

997
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,200
about a person is a credit card that's

998
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,059
all it takes right now to get anything

999
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,980
you want about any person a little bit

1000
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,200
of hunting and you know used to be

1001
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,399
things that we would do and oh that's

1002
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,919
illegal things like that nowadays all of

1003
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:48,299
our information is basically public

1004
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,580
whether we like it or not whether it's

1005
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,019
available through data Brokers whether

1006
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:53,519
it's available in underground markets

1007
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,679
it's something that we need to to deal

1008
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,919
with

1009
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,059
um and uh when it's kind of funny I

1010
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:01,380
presented uh some of this stuff at

1011
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,360
Defcon and we were actually approached

1012
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,120
by uh some folks um in La they were

1013
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,440
working on a show for a crime watch

1014
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,399
Daily

1015
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,679
um and we uh I was able to work with uh

1016
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,879
one of our

1017
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:14,879
um uh researchers Craig at tripwire a

1018
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,619
lot smarter than me when it comes to um

1019
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,239
exploiting vulnerabilities and things

1020
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,159
but we were asked if we can hack a smart

1021
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,000
home

1022
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,320
um and so I'll give you guys just a

1023
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,040
quick video of the results

1024
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:28,379
Vicki Johnson's new beachfront house is

1025
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:32,699
not only spectacular it's smart she can

1026
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,040
control most everything from her phone

1027
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,879
or tablet it's pretty smart

1028
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,980
the drapes go up and down automatically

1029
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,699
we can close doors we can flush toilets

1030
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,800
we can turn lights on and off we can

1031
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,139
turn the air conditioning on and off TVs

1032
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:52,260
music it's a brilliant house we were

1033
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,719
told it was hack proof we'll see about

1034
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,599
that they think they're coming to take a

1035
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,420
tour of a smart house but what we're

1036
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,820
really doing is hacking her house during

1037
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,820
the party and potentially the devices of

1038
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,740
every guest who walks through the front

1039
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,859
door helping me are two cyber Security

1040
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,520
Experts Craig young and Ken Weston so

1041
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,020
first we need to break into the Wi-Fi

1042
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,359
Vicki has 28 devices connected to the

1043
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,820
home's wireless internet once they were

1044
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,640
into the wi-fi system our hackers were

1045
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,160
quickly able to commandeer the home's

1046
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,260
cameras these are the security cameras

1047
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,579
to the house that you've hacked into

1048
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:34,980
exactly here we actually can see this is

1049
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,780
actually our car out here this is the

1050
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,579
front door if you don't secure them

1051
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,260
properly then they become insecurity

1052
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,980
cameras first we turn off the lights

1053
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,920
[Music]

1054
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,180
then with control of the security

1055
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,060
cameras we divert the video signal and

1056
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,540
play it on the TV in the living room

1057
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,880
with everyone's attention on the TV the

1058
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,880
hackers talk to the guests we have taken

1059
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,700
control of this house the lights the

1060
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,820
security cameras now a special message

1061
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,119
from me in the car is piped in I'm Anna

1062
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,700
Garcia from Prime watch Daily and this

1063
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,099
house has just been hacked it was free

1064
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,020
or cheap for the people that are

1065
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,160
actually implementing the the

1066
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,579
installation Vicky Johnson's new

1067
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,740
beachfront house is not only spect

1068
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,560
yeah so that was a lot of fun uh what's

1069
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,900
interesting too is that uh Craig young

1070
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,400
who actually was there with me he's now

1071
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,320
at Tesla which is kind of cool

1072
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,320
um and uh when uh to crack the Wi-Fi

1073
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,000
password we use a cloud cracking service

1074
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,020
which

1075
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,760
um we had to pay like some money to do

1076
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,680
that but we actually found it was a

1077
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,060
number we did a search for the number

1078
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,500
and was actually the guy's cell phone

1079
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,540
number that was on his website

1080
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,400
um and a lot of people actually use

1081
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,960
their Wi-Fi network like his parents

1082
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,400
were there they connected to it that's

1083
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,680
why we could have compromised more when

1084
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,060
we were in there I actually also had

1085
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,380
access to like a lot of their computer

1086
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,200
file shares that were wide open we did

1087
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,940
have access to the um the toilet that

1088
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,900
was fun

1089
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,119
um like it was it's a if there was a

1090
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,560
cleaning mechanism so you can actually

1091
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,660
make it so that it keeps flushing

1092
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,420
um it was it was good times

1093
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,640
um but uh so kind of when I think about

1094
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,900
all this stuff when I think about some

1095
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,460
of the dangers right we think about okay

1096
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,839
well there's information that can be

1097
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,520
compromised about us like even in our

1098
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,260
own home like I think about all of the

1099
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,760
the data if I get into someone's Wi-Fi

1100
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,920
network I could I could gather a lot of

1101
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,359
data there I can get a lot of

1102
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,339
information about them online

1103
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:45,480
um and so I started to think about this

1104
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,740
you know you might be familiar with

1105
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,440
Maslow's hierarchy of needs I sort of

1106
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,940
develop this is the hierarchy of data

1107
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,720
bleed

1108
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,640
um and so the idea here is at the top

1109
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,560
there's data that we create and and

1110
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,000
that's data that we have very we feel we

1111
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,320
have control over when I create an

1112
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,000
Office document I create a file on my

1113
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,920
computer I have control of that I can

1114
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,660
delete it I can back it up I can do

1115
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,040
whatever I want

1116
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,359
um but then what happens when we start

1117
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:07,740
moving things to the cloud we start

1118
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,359
leveraging social media things like that

1119
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,339
there is data that gets created for us

1120
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:13,859
and that could be from you know uh you

1121
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,060
know when we upload things to the cloud

1122
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,339
is presented to us it can be when we

1123
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,740
make uh buy an airplane ticket when and

1124
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,180
we when we do all these sorts of things

1125
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,740
there's a lot of data that gets

1126
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,380
generated for us and we have a lot less

1127
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,420
control over that a lot of times that

1128
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,400
data is now in and whatever the policies

1129
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,800
are of that particular website or or

1130
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,020
that social service right where we're

1131
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,480
sort of tied to that we can request that

1132
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,520
data be deleted but we don't know if

1133
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,780
it's been archived we don't know how

1134
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,980
many copies they were we don't know if

1135
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,140
they've sold that data and then further

1136
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,280
down there's data that's actually

1137
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,780
created about us and a lot of times we

1138
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,880
don't even know this is happening a lot

1139
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,619
of information when we talk about data

1140
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,060
Brokers they're Gathering all this

1141
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,020
different data they're leveraging

1142
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,520
machine learning that you can build a

1143
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,220
very rich profile of an individual and

1144
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,619
sometimes that data you know it can also

1145
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,359
be compromised and that's when we get

1146
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,280
into Shadow data and that's data that's

1147
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,079
sort of uh starting to get into the

1148
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,720
bounds of we consider it legal right if

1149
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,099
I can get all this information about an

1150
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:09,780
individual maybe their credit card

1151
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,940
number their social security number and

1152
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,560
this is where you have underground

1153
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,240
markets where you can actually Harvest

1154
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,280
this information the more data breaches

1155
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,720
that we have I remember used to be when

1156
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,640
back in day when we had a data breach it

1157
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,260
was a big deal you know you get those

1158
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,359
letters that oh your your credit card

1159
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:25,680
was compromised or your social security

1160
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,140
number we're really sorry here's uh

1161
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,820
here's a free year of identity theft

1162
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,320
protection I think at this point we all

1163
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,700
have like a thousand years of free

1164
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,619
identity theft protection and we've

1165
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,119
become numb to it

1166
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:38,460
um so again uh so that's where I kind of

1167
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,780
talk about that's like the shadow day

1168
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,700
that's we have no control over that data

1169
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,619
at all if there's no way that we can

1170
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:44,700
actually release it so I'm actually

1171
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,380
looking forward to Jacob's talk I think

1172
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,820
it's after me he's gonna be talking

1173
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,320
about things that you can do to protect

1174
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,240
your data so that should be pretty

1175
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,320
exciting

1176
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,920
um I could I could use it for sure

1177
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,359
um and sort of on that thing like I

1178
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,760
actually identified a vulnerability uh

1179
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,040
helped identify a vulnerability that was

1180
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,040
um out there there was a a server um

1181
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,119
that was

1182
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,040
um being it was like indexing emails

1183
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,940
from uh onto Google and uh started with

1184
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,440
like what was one person we looked at it

1185
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,940
and the starter actually wrote a script

1186
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,160
and that was I had access to over 2200

1187
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,020
emails there was no authentication at

1188
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,859
all

1189
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,900
not only could I read all these emails

1190
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,359
but I could actually I could send emails

1191
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:26,520
I could reset Services I could get a

1192
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,859
password resets if I wanted to this is

1193
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,800
really a a pretty serious issue it was

1194
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,020
actually a telemax they'd acquired

1195
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,420
Prodigy and so that's where there was

1196
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,579
some sort of configuration issue when we

1197
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:40,800
approached them we we did this ethically

1198
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,540
first I contacted Google to get all the

1199
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,400
data removed we contacted them to let

1200
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,920
them know about the issue and then we

1201
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,300
worked with the reporter and we were

1202
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,540
talking about this in El economista and

1203
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,440
then they were saying this was

1204
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,300
industrial sabotage and blah blah blah

1205
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,440
and it's like no you guys just

1206
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,480
misconfigured a server come on

1207
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,280
um and so but you know this is a

1208
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,140
situation where a vendor makes one

1209
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,540
simple mistake and then your entire you

1210
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,040
know Digital Life can be compromised

1211
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,359
right so

1212
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:07,800
um again this is kind of what we're

1213
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,619
dealing with and today

1214
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:13,020
um so uh Shameless plug I actually did

1215
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,000
some other research where

1216
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,859
um like when I was at a tripwire I was

1217
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:18,660
investigating a lot of the stolen credit

1218
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,760
cards and the karting markets and um and

1219
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,500
dark Nets and things like that the dark

1220
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,740
web and uh looking at how um uh the the

1221
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,200
markets work and I started running these

1222
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,000
forums where I actually found they were

1223
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,740
uh hackers that were looking for Insider

1224
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,320
information so information around like

1225
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,300
earnings reports or something like that

1226
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,820
that can be traded and I was like that's

1227
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,680
really interesting because

1228
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,180
um with the cryptocurrencies that were

1229
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,619
happening I started seeing a lot more

1230
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,119
like white collar criminals that were in

1231
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,619
these forums that were looking for

1232
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,260
hackers and I and I was like if you have

1233
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,820
white collar criminals and hackers and

1234
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,380
they get together like you can just send

1235
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,240
the cryptocurrencies they don't have to

1236
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,980
know each other like they can make a ton

1237
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,780
of money and I started investigating

1238
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,339
some of the actual cases and I found one

1239
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,079
that was really interesting there was a

1240
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:04,800
a case where uh a group of people

1241
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,740
um they they uh were accessing this uh

1242
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,839
server the pr servers they were getting

1243
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,579
news reports I found a bunch of cases

1244
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,320
and so I did some presentations around

1245
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,260
this and down the rabbit hole I was like

1246
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,579
I started doing this and then I found

1247
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,320
there was one where they made 30 million

1248
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,820
dollars right there was a group of

1249
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,020
people they made 30 million dollars off

1250
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,060
these illicit trades uh one's like one

1251
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,680
of the bunch of them ended up going to

1252
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,320
jail the hackers were in in Russia or

1253
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,460
Eastern Europe

1254
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,099
um they're still pretty much on the run

1255
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:34,320
and then just recently there was another

1256
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,720
case there was four Russians that were

1257
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,240
found guilty one of them was a former

1258
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,720
Gru operative they made over 84 million

1259
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,359
dollars in illicit traits so if you want

1260
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,320
to learn more about this there's going

1261
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,119
to be a malicious Life podcast about

1262
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,980
this on the 17th it's going to come out

1263
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,980
so I really like those podcasts the way

1264
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,599
they're narrated so I think they'll tell

1265
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,760
a better story than I can so uh

1266
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,099
hopefully you guys can see that

1267
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:00,839
um and with that that that's for the end

1268
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,000
of my presentation but I think one thing

1269
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,500
I just want to kind of leave you with on

1270
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,720
this is you know think about people

1271
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,400
always ask me like how do I get started

1272
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,740
in cyber security and I like sometimes I

1273
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,880
look back and I'm like I didn't know how

1274
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,680
I got started it's like how do I get in

1275
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,880
cyber security and I'm like I don't know

1276
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,040
I'm trying to get out

1277
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,079
um but I think the important thing is

1278
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:20,940
here is like you sort of Follow Your

1279
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,440
Passion like especially right now

1280
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,880
there's so many different areas of

1281
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,260
security that you can get involved in

1282
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,359
like Cloud security you can get into

1283
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,940
dfir there's all these different aspects

1284
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,619
and there's no way at this point I think

1285
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:33,839
that you can cover everything I I would

1286
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,280
recommend getting a general overview of

1287
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,740
kind of what you like uh like of

1288
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,420
security and kind of dig deeper into

1289
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,040
something but really Follow Your Passion

1290
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,900
if you're not passionate about something

1291
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,040
if you're not passionate about what

1292
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,480
you're doing in infosec you're not going

1293
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,160
to do uh you're not going to go very far

1294
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,839
I don't think if you hate what you're

1295
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,220
doing you go to work every day and you

1296
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,140
just oh gosh this sucks right if you're

1297
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,599
not able to be excited and have passion

1298
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,520
about what you do and have have a pride

1299
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,619
in the work that you're doing it's going

1300
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:00,119
to be really difficult

1301
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,500
um you know I've been lucky very lucky

1302
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,540
just kind of find my path

1303
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,099
um and and what I've been doing and I

1304
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,540
really love what I do I love the people

1305
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,339
that I work with in particular I think

1306
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:10,859
infosec folks are some of the the most

1307
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,119
