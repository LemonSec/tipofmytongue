4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,559

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,259
let's uh let's get it back okay so

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,240

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,140
and also thank you for wearing your

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,199
masks it's been really easy you know

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,240
that that aspect of it has not been a

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,760
problem a few

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,460
um a little retrospective of some of the

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,160
last 10 years of shirts and badges

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,200
there's some cool ones here and I'm

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,800
really bummed I don't have like that one

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,899
for sure

18
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,300
uh and balancing that's an upside down

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,219
Sasquatch I wish I had those two

20
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,600
and let's see badges

21
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,640
um I've only got

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,440
well actually I think I have four of

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,180
those I don't have the 2014 one

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,559
obviously

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,300
um right so who am I why am I here you

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,339
already know I'm Scott

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,939
um I'm the event coordinator and uh Joe

28
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,040
wanted more free time so uh yeah uh he

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,560
talked me into doing this um

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,100
so right so the theme we talked about

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,540
this in the morning I don't know if you

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,939
guys missed it at 9 30 but uh basically

33
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,580
we evolved from the top image down to

34
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,920
the bottom image and the scenario is

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,320
Sasquatch coming out of hibernation out

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,360
of his cave oh I can take my mask off so

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,320
I'm talking

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,200
I love this mask hanger here and

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,720
um he's like being blinded by the

40
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,540
cyberpunk's son so that was kind of our

41
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,400
concept there we had some other ones but

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,920
they didn't really go anywhere and yes

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,700
the insecurity pun is intended

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,360
um

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,840
so on for these designs we have to thank

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,420

168
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,880
we're going to notionally stop that at

169
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,580
18 30 so that Michael has time to

170
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,699
prepare the Price slides

171
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,580
um and he will award the prizes for the

172
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,819
CTF after the quiz show completes and

173
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:40,319
does their prizes

174
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,080
big prizes talked about this earlier

175
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,560
um could show prizes for that as well

176
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,960
um 18 to 1900 hours or as soon as we can

177
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,580
get that started

178
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,759
um what else transparency budget

179
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,919
um

180
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,139
the donations from

181
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,900
um attendees over fourteen thousand

182
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,539
dollars wow you guys make this happen

183
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,639
thank you

184
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,400
give themselves a hand

185
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,020
so I think

186
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,720
you know we'll probably exceed 25k by

187
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,500
but not by too much for our spend um I

188
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,120
think the big thing that you know that's

189
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,879
increasing is catering no worries

190
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,099
um it's all good

191
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,840
um

192
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,060
right let's see what else

193
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,960
um so sponsors contributed 19 000 of our

194
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,260
budget for this year so also let's give

195
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,640
them a hand for that because that's

196
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,360
that's nice

197
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,779
but I think we have to recognize that

198
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,300
you attendees kicked in over half of

199
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,399
what we're going to spend so thank you

200
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,420
so much

201
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,360
next year Hardware badges yes please we

202
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,800
love these badges

203
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,440
but I would like to see I'd like to see

204
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,240
a hardware version of this in a smaller

205
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,000
size that's more convenient to wear

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,260
we're going to need more room we're

207
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,000
going to need two talk tracks and

208
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,640
next year right

209
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,019
um

210
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,060
do we do it in October we're going to do

211
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,899
a survey do we keep the same venue

212
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:16,680
I think

213
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,380
one of the one of the I think the things

214
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,779
that we want to ask you are what did you

215
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,820
think about PSU

216
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,980
how what's your general feeling how was

217
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,920
the event for you here

218
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,779
positive

219
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,839
negative I see I see all positive I

220
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,180
think the lunch options around here are

221
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,740
really great much better than the

222
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,620
convention center for sure

223
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,760
um

224
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,140
let's see what else

225
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,839
um I think that's it

226
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:49,980
yeah

227
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,279
I think that's it so cool

228
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,480
great we'll set up quiz show

229
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,839

234
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,940
basically committed to nothing and

235
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,339
obligated myself to nothing and it still

236
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,380
happened and it happened great and

237
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,060
everything went well and that's all

238
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,860
