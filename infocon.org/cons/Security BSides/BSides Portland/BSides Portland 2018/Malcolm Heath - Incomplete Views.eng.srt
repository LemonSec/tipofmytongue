1
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,360
all right so hopefully everyone can hear

2
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,810
me okay or should I grab the mic it's

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,730
good okay so um yeah this is titled

4
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,229
incomplete views I'm gonna be talking

5
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,770
about network incident response sort of

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:33,620
as it actually happens rather than maybe

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:35,630
how we think it might Who am I well I'm

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,480
a senior security engineer and I'm with

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,760
that five networks and I'm also a member

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,699
of the f5 security incident response

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,399
team which is essentially a group within

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,130
our support organization that helps

13
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,180
customers when they are under attack

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,100
it's actually something that we just

15
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,160
offer to everybody it's not a charged

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,960
for service they can call in and they

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,220
can say help we need some assistance and

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,310
we try to help them out as best as we

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,500
can so because of that I end up talking

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,930
to a lot of different customers under a

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,369
lot of different kinds of attacks with a

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,290
lot of different strategies and

23
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:11,840
capabilities in terms of network

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,030
response so essentially this or Network

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,200
Incident Response so this is essentially

26
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,969
me trying to tell you some things that

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,920
I've seen and learned from that

28
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:24,579
experience of being a fly on the wall in

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,780
a bunch of different kinds of contexts

30
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:28,068
and I should say this is not a vendor

31
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,590
presentation I'm not going to be

32
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:32,359
mentioning specific vendor technologies

33
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,569
certainly not my the company that I work

34
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:38,119
for nor anybody else's this is going to

35
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:39,859
be relatively high level and process

36
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:43,270
focused to a great extent although we

37
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:47,389
will get into some specifics of specific

38
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:51,619
broad tactical tool sets and so forth

39
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:52,729
that you might want to use so the next

40
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:55,490
question that I have is I don't actually

41
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:56,840
really know who attends besides I mean I

42
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,939
know we're all interested in information

43
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,649
security in some way or another so I

44
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:02,449
want to just ask a couple of questions

45
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:04,549
to kind of get a sense of where you're

46
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,950
all at and what you're interested in so

47
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,690
how many of you have done or do incident

48
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:12,560
or incident response in some way or

49
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:15,880
another great how many of you think you

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,880
do it really really really well

51
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:25,280
oh come on are you now okay and let's

52
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:31,379
see what's another good question to ask

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:33,209
how many of you feel that the biggest

54
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:36,000
issue that you have with the way that

55
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:40,379
you do Incident Response is your tool

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,969
set like what products you have or what

57
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:46,170
capabilities you have in a technical

58
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:48,030
level okay what are two right and how

59
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,030
many of you feel that it's much more of

60
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:56,090
a matter of communication

61
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:57,919
and how do I want to put it

62
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,290
communication we were hearing groups

63
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:04,349
it's essentially human resource stuff

64
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,168
okay yeah okay okay so we got the right

65
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,488
audience that's great so what I'm going

66
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:10,439
to be talking about it's not about

67
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,849
forensics I'm not gonna be going into

68
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:17,010
anything about determining what happened

69
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:20,250
you know after the attack I'm not gonna

70
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,929
be talking about attribution and I'm not

71
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,569
going to be talking about detecting

72
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,909
implants or threat hunting or any of

73
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,379
these sorts of things because the sort

74
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:32,099
of incidents that I've typically been

75
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:34,798
involved in don't really go into those

76
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,879
areas those happen off scene the main

77
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:41,220
thing that what I've been able to do is

78
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:42,810
help customers respond to attacks while

79
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,699
they are happening and the goal of that

80
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,879
is essentially just emergency response

81
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:50,669
right they are suffering some sort of a

82
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,790
situation that is inhibiting their

83
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:57,349
ability to perform their business their

84
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,548
sites down their database is slow their

85
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:01,018
accounts are getting locked out whatever

86
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,930
it happens to be it's a it's a direct

87
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:06,269
and impactful situation for them so the

88
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,739
goal that we are trying to do is just

89
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,989
get them to the point where they can

90
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,790
stop the bleeding take a breath and then

91
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:13,259
figure out what to do next right so

92
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,209
that's that's really the scope of the

93
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,130
Incident Response there are of course

94
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,978
lots of other parts of Incident Response

95
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,909
that you have to go through but the talk

96
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,909
is going to be focused on this

97
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,720
and it a lot of it has to do with

98
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,560
preparation but this is the sort of

99
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,060
thing that I've had the chance to see

100
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,900
some of these probably everybody's seen

101
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,630
some floods UDP floods ICMP floods get

102
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,729
floods right pseudo random subdomain

103
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,310
attacks against DNS that's another good

104
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,440
one but we've also seen things like kind

105
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,580
of massive SQL injection attempts

106
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:53,550
against Web Apps we see a lot of brute

107
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,340
force authentication attacks certainly

108
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,140
against SSH I mean everybody anybody who

109
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,349
runs and exposed as a safe server gets

110
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,150
brute force like constantly but also

111
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,590
against Web Apps and pretty much

112
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,919
anything that you can possibly stick a

113
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,510
username and password into we've seen

114
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,810
some very interesting things with

115
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:14,460
computational attacks against databases

116
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,720
and and in case anybody know it doesn't

117
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,909
really quite know what I mean by a

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,350
computational attack I mean a denial of

119
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,360
service attack that leverages the

120
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,360
ability to make something do more

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,400
computations and you wanted to write so

122
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,170
a really good example of this was a

123
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:34,229
company that had a web-based API that

124
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,700
was for finding a provider and I'm sure

125
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,330
you've seen these sort of things like

126
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,710
type in your zip code type in the kind

127
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,120
of provider you want like a medical

128
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,450
provider or whatever and we'll show you

129
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,860
the doctors offices in your area

130
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,630
well somebody and I don't know who it

131
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,480
was but whoever was attacking them had

132
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,969
decided that the best thing for them to

133
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,730
do was to set they figured out that they

134
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,330
could actually use coordinates in the

135
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,620
API call to determine where you were

136
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,550
they set the coordinates to be in the

137
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,740
middle of the Indian Ocean right and

138
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,330
they said the kind of provider that they

139
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,050
wanted to get was like everybody yo show

140
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,490
me everything

141
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:16,800
show me unliving you know all of them so

142
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,960
one little get request to that API and

143
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,140
suddenly their database was having to

144
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,380
scan every single row and their database

145
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:28,260
blew up okay that's a really good

146
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,360
example of a computational attack we

147
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,700
also occasionally see essentially

148
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,680
vulnerability based denial of service

149
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,510
you know obviously we're thinking about

150
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,569
vulnerabilities in terms of real remote

151
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,659
code execution

152
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:42,279
but there is a huge classification of

153
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:44,169
vulnerabilities that people have to deal

154
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:45,999
with that are basically just I can send

155
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:49,869
you a particular kind of network flow

156
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:51,879
and your stuff will break your switch

157
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:56,619
will fall over your firewall will reboot

158
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:58,270
your proxy device will crash whatever

159
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:59,740
happens to be and these are really great

160
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,139
because they're from an attacker

161
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,909
perspective because even if you have

162
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,319
high availability infrastructure where

163
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:06,639
you've got fail overs and all this sort

164
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,229
of things going on I can just send one

165
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,330
here and same one there and same one

166
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:11,979
there insane one thing and just hold

167
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,938
everything down for as long as I want

168
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:17,469
so also interestingly enough and this

169
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:19,839
one I I was actually kind of surprised

170
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:20,589
by I'm web scraping is kind of a thing

171
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,349
now

172
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:26,139
competitors scrape each other's websites

173
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:30,369
to find out how much the opposition is

174
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:31,749
charging for things or for a whole

175
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:33,899
variety of reasons in fact there's an

176
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:36,279
entire I think I'll call it a botnet

177
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,830
sneaker and they actually some people

178
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:43,569
call it sneaker net that exists solely

179
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:47,438
to troll sneaker seller sites to find

180
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:50,080
the most awesome sneakers to buy it's

181
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,919
all very very automated because the

182
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,029
sneaker heads love their sneakers it is

183
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,469
legitimate in the sense that they just

184
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:57,939
want to get the sneakers before

185
00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:01,029
everybody else does right they're

186
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:04,329
customers but a misconfigured sneaker

187
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:05,949
net can certainly take down a website if

188
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:07,539
the traffic level is high enough or if

189
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,719
there's some if they trip over some sort

190
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:11,860
of ulnar ability that happens we've also

191
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:13,959
seen some stuff that's been in the news

192
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:20,319
like GRE flooding with the Mirai botnet

193
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:21,459
that was what hit Krebs on security I

194
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,999
don't know if you all heard about that

195
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:28,479
it was like 600 Giga bits a second or

196
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:33,310
something insane like that and a lot

197
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,870
more so this is the obligatory warning

198
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:36,458
slide no one in this room needs to hear

199
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,750
this but I'm gonna say it anyway is just

200
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:42,789
in case if you haven't been hit by some

201
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,078
of these things you probably gonna get

202
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,829
hit by some of these things at some

203
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:50,649
point some of the companies that I work

204
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:52,359
for or work with just

205
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:55,089
this is a cost of business they are

206
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,379
under constant attack I had a kind of

207
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:57,759
fun discussion with one of them they

208
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,809
sent me a packet caption they said can

209
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,699
you tell me what's wrong and tell me

210
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:02,079
what's going on and I looked at it and

211
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:03,819
immediately I was like oh you're under a

212
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:08,319
massive syn flood and they're like oh

213
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:11,050
yeah we know about that like okay yeah

214
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:14,889
we don't care like 40% of our network

215
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:17,410
traffic is is floods but it doesn't

216
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:19,240
impact our business so we don't care we

217
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,519
have some mitigations whatever you know

218
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,939
what we actually want to know is what is

219
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:29,679
this particular HTTP request doing okay

220
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:30,819
well but for most companies this doesn't

221
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,889
happen all the time right it happens

222
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:37,479
every so often and that and it's that

223
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:39,160
that lack of predictable mists of it

224
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,679
that is really one of the key things

225
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,240
that I want to talk about because it

226
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,980
makes it really hard to prepare for it

227
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,329
if you don't have a plan in place to try

228
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,420
to address these attack these sorts of

229
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:50,888
attacks every time they hit you it's

230
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,540
gonna be a mad scramble right you're

231
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,980
just gonna everyone's gonna freak out

232
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,219
and have to run around and figure out

233
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,870
what to do and what I'm trying to say is

234
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:03,189
that probably there's a better way to do

235
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,540
it so um one of the things that

236
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:06,370
surprised me though about some of these

237
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,449
things is the lack of detection

238
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,220
detection is apparently really hard

239
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:13,569
people into detection super well and and

240
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,509
part of it is because we are so

241
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:18,189
operationally focused that until

242
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:20,379
something becomes a problem we don't

243
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:23,800
really notice or care about it in some

244
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:25,779
ways right so we don't necessarily put

245
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,209
the effort into trying to detect the

246
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:30,519
slow and incremental rise in the number

247
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:33,369
of authentication attempts we think

248
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,350
about that or we may not care that our

249
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,029
network bandwidth is slowly creeping up

250
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,769
over the course of several hours until

251
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:42,819
it actually gets to the point where the

252
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:45,459
servers are getting slow um so for

253
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:46,899
example I've seen numerous brute-force

254
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:49,109
attacks that were detected when the

255
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:51,459
authentication systems stopped working

256
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:55,449
that is probably not when you want to

257
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:57,638
detect the brute force I have seen many

258
00:10:55,449 --> 00:11:00,519
web scraping situations where in this

259
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,620
particular case there was a company that

260
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,140
was providing a service that leveraged

261
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,480
another service in December

262
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,030
opening was implicit back-end database

263
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,650
or something that they had that company

264
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:14,490
called the first company and said why

265
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:19,530
are you dossing us and they were like

266
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:21,450
what do you mean turns out that somebody

267
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,160
was web scraping through this first

268
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,130
company and that was generating just a

269
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,050
ton of traffic on the back end the first

270
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,790
company was better set up to handle that

271
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:33,390
level of load they didn't really notice

272
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:36,270
that there was a problem but the back

273
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,220
end fell over and so it rapidly became a

274
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,750
problem because the the back end company

275
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,470
was gonna be like unless you stop this

276
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:47,310
we are cutting off your contract you are

277
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:50,010
going to go out of business okay maybe

278
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,140
it's an emergency now generally speaking

279
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,790
right detection comes after or because

280
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,470
there's some kind of a problem as I said

281
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,870
so this tends to lead to a mad scramble

282
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,970
and we should probably do better than

283
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,010
that

284
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,630
um the other things that surprised me is

285
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,540
like once I get on the phone and I

286
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,980
should say that there are quite a few

287
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,980
customers who really know what they're

288
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,510
doing and they call up my company

289
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,770
because they have one specific question

290
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,420
about how to configure one of our

291
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,040
devices to do a particular thing and

292
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,420
those are great those are super easy we

293
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
just hand them the documentation or

294
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,630
point you know tell them what to do and

295
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,760
then they go away and it's lovely and

296
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,750
they know exactly what they're doing but

297
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,120
there are an awful lot of other

298
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,220
companies that I've been on where I go

299
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,660
on to a conference call with like 30 or

300
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:38,420
40 people all at once including vendors

301
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:40,800
other vendors IT staff security staff

302
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,870
occasionally there's even like a CFO or

303
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,810
a CEO who's actually on the call yelling

304
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,280
at people because there's some psych

305
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,310
down situations that they're handling

306
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,430
and it's a complete mess right it's a

307
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,260
very strange experience to be a vendor

308
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:58,620
who is helping out a company and being

309
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:01,950
kind of the calm one who can kind of try

310
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,980
to advise what steps we should be doing

311
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:07,200
because to be honest with you it's not

312
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,000
that big of a deal to me I want to help

313
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,830
them but it's not my job on the line I

314
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,100
guess maybe that's one way I can be

315
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:15,180
calmer than everybody else but again it

316
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,220
doesn't really seem like we should be

317
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,660
doing it

318
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,170
another thing we run into all the time

319
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,089
is in order to help out the customers we

320
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,729
need data right we need packet captures

321
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,829
we need configurations we need some sort

322
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,620
of in information to base our

323
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:32,969
recommendations on and it is

324
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,720
surprisingly difficult for people to get

325
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,850
this to us

326
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,579
they don't have pre-existing

327
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,430
capabilities to get on to a switch or a

328
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:44,250
router or a proxy or even a host to get

329
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:48,888
a peek app they don't have log

330
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:52,470
aggregation of any kind setup they don't

331
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:54,060
they and especially a lot of times the

332
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,910
reason is is because I'm talking to the

333
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,768
security person and the security person

334
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,600
has to go over and ask the IT person who

335
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:02,370
has to go ask the network ops person to

336
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,680
get the data for them and so it's this

337
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,899
long chain of trying to get things and

338
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,319
it slows us down and because of that

339
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,819
usually more often than I want to admit

340
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:15,029
the attack is over before we've actually

341
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:16,378
gotten any data and a lot of times the

342
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:18,389
attack is over before we've actually

343
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,730
been able to get any data that was about

344
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:21,870
the attack in other words by the time we

345
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,680
get to the point where we can get a peak

346
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:28,290
app the attacks already gone

347
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,779
so the peak app shows nothing right the

348
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:34,069
attacks done and we have no evidence and

349
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:36,360
we have no way to say anything about it

350
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:38,910
so we also have a lack of analysis

351
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,069
capabilities we have a lack of knowledge

352
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,170
in environments about how to remediate

353
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:44,719
things like what points in their network

354
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,490
they can actually implement controls

355
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,920
sure a firewall but you gotta get a hold

356
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,509
of the firewall team the firewall team

357
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,089
may not know how to do this specific

358
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:56,009
kind of remediation you want and I'm not

359
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:58,920
really blaming anybody for this this is

360
00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:01,529
hard I get it their organizations are

361
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:05,490
complex but I am trying to say we should

362
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:07,139
probably try to improve it one way in

363
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,899
the industry we have typically tried to

364
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,790
improve it is by providing SuperDuper

365
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:16,889
vendor tools to do a lot of this for us

366
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:18,990
right and I am very aware being a vendor

367
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:21,240
that our tools are expensive

368
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,160
and they're hard to configure and I'm

369
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,120
not speaking about f5 in particular I'm

370
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,290
speaking in general about vendor stuff

371
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,149
they are expensive they're hard to

372
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,599
figure out how to use you often have to

373
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:32,160
change

374
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,180
things to integrate them into your

375
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,310
environment you can also try to shift

376
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,519
the responsibility for dealing with the

377
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,138
tax to things like sock as a service or

378
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,790
scrubbing services or things like that

379
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:49,889
those can be very expensive however of

380
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,880
course if you are actually going to get

381
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:55,440
subject to these attacks they are costly

382
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,680
they can be called same terms of

383
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:03,050
downtime lost revenue stress on your

384
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,979
employees I have been on several

385
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,199
situations where the people that on the

386
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,339
phone that I was talking to had

387
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,269
literally been up for 36 hours straight

388
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:16,399
those people are not going to be any

389
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:19,079
good for anything else for a week after

390
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,389
so can we prepare ourselves without

391
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,790
having to spend a ton of money or commit

392
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:29,759
ourselves to very specific vendor models

393
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:32,009
or what have you and I think we can so

394
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,180
what do we have to help ourselves out an

395
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:34,860
incident responsible we may not have

396
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,310
expensive tools and we may not have deep

397
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,470
security knowledge in our teams we may

398
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,739
have very complex networks very complex

399
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:47,130
organizations but what we do have is or

400
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,569
we can get is data we don't always have

401
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,519
it at our fingertips and I think that's

402
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:51,990
one of the biggest problems because what

403
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,329
we need to do is get the right data

404
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:57,569
which is I'll go into this a little bit

405
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:58,949
later the rightness of the data depends

406
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:01,649
on the context in which it's going to be

407
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:02,910
used we need to get it fast and we need

408
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:04,589
to get a lot of people who can

409
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,569
understand it and do something about it

410
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:11,668
and then we need to do something take

411
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:14,129
action right so we have the ability to

412
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:15,870
generate a lot of data if we want we all

413
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,260
know this right I mean you could and

414
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:21,119
some companies in fact do capture every

415
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,669
single packet that goes in or comes out

416
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,289
of their network now they do this

417
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,870
sometimes with things like sflow which

418
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:30,179
is more of a metadata thing about source

419
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,299
IP destination IP ports and so forth

420
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,610
some people do actual like full-on

421
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:39,059
everything on the wire gets logged

422
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:41,639
that's great for forensics it is

423
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,020
probably less good for incident response

424
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,740
than you might imagine

425
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:49,170
mainly because a 10 gigabit per second

426
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,140
connection fully utilized will generate

427
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:56,490
1.25 gigabytes of capture file per

428
00:17:52,140 --> 00:18:00,060
second at least I have been handed 80

429
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:02,010
gig capture files in my job and the

430
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:06,419
biggest problem was finding a machine

431
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:09,120
that I could open them on double click

432
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,980
on it open it up in Wireshark come back

433
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,340
some time the next day when it's

434
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:18,810
finished loading right so along with

435
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:21,629
that we can capture debug logging from

436
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,950
every single process if you want that

437
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,480
might not do great things for

438
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,470
application performance but we could get

439
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,140
it almost every system you're dealing

440
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:33,150
with has SNMP or could be made to use it

441
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,570
we could capture and graph every single

442
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,940
nib we can do all the vlogging from our

443
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:42,149
APs and firewalls and ids systems and

444
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:44,250
everything else okay we don't collect

445
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,380
all of it because it's way too much and

446
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,790
we don't have the room to store it and

447
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,530
we don't have any analysis capabilities

448
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,000
or dealing with it maybe you have a sim

449
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,800
and maybe your sim is awesome and maybe

450
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,390
you can take all this in then you still

451
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,210
need to analyze it and you still need to

452
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,440
figure out how to interpret it

453
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,330
so what we're trying to look for really

454
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,590
is what's the sweet spot for incident

455
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,669
response now I'm not saying that that

456
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,929
gathering all that information isn't

457
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,790
useful in a whole bunch of different

458
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,440
contexts right but we need to narrow

459
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,720
down the focus of what information we're

460
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:15,200
going to gather to deal with incidents

461
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,200
and have that at our fingertips so I

462
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:21,960
should say to the mitigation tools or

463
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:26,520
mitigation points are kind of something

464
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,340
that we need to think about um obviously

465
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,040
you don't want a block

466
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:35,639
well sometimes you do actually I I had

467
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:39,240
one customer who was a vendor in Canada

468
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,210
and for some reason or another they only

469
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,830
sold to Canada that was their customer

470
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,250
base they could actually literally say

471
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:53,040
that we are only for Canadians they were

472
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:55,840
under attack from Pakistan and southern

473
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,908
Sudan and Italy

474
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,408
I don't know something like that they

475
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:01,330
were actually make the decision we can

476
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:03,010
use geolocation to just block anything

477
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,080
that isn't coming from Canada that was

478
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:08,140
acceptable to them most people are not

479
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,639
going to be in that situation clearly so

480
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,960
we need to have good medication

481
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,220
techniques that will allow us to just

482
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,960
block the stuff that we want to block

483
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,340
and not interrupt any other businesses

484
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,870
but sometimes we just have to bring the

485
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,309
hammer down and just say these are bad

486
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:21,428
IPs and we're gonna block him or

487
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:23,440
whatever so we can mitigate at different

488
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:25,330
layers so this is based on what you know

489
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,610
kind of like I know all my customers are

490
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,350
just Canadians that's a good example of

491
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:33,010
that sometimes it's what you have access

492
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:34,330
to clearly there are tons of places

493
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,120
within a network infrastructure that you

494
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,100
can block things you as a security

495
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,299
person may not have access to all of

496
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,850
those and I'll get into a little bit

497
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:45,549
more about how we can fix that later but

498
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:48,939
you use what you can right and you

499
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:52,210
generally want a block as far forward as

500
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,559
you can because if you block it on say

501
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,820
if you block it on a firewall and this

502
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,230
is pretty basic if you block it on a

503
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,668
firewall it's gonna be more efficient

504
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,740
than trying to block it on you were 50

505
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:05,409
web servers individually right right

506
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:07,690
okay so one of the funny things about

507
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:10,960
data is that it's not value neutral in

508
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:13,750
general one might argue that a wireshark

509
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,149
capture wide open Wireshark capture is

510
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:20,980
really just the bytes on the wire and

511
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:23,949
there's no inherent meaning in that one

512
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,360
might say that s enemy SNMP counter data

513
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,929
could be considered the same way it's

514
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,279
really just a fact that you can look at

515
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:34,210
but almost all the other logging that we

516
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:36,340
do is done for some specific purpose and

517
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,429
it is filtered in some way by the people

518
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:42,449
who created that logging right I hope

519
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:45,039
I'm making a sense with this so

520
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,710
applications for example log things that

521
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,700
are useful to application developers

522
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:52,299
those may not be the things that

523
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:56,260
security engineers want to see people

524
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:57,970
who log network performance data log it

525
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,950
to tune the performance of their

526
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:03,039
applications they don't log it to detect

527
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:06,309
attacks necessarily um quite often

528
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:09,350
applications just simply say I'm working

529
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:10,820
within parameters and

530
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,350
maybe they're oh maybe I didn't handle

531
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,840
one request right and they'll log that

532
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:17,629
that's great it doesn't say I'm

533
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,580
misbehaving because I'm under attack or

534
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,799
because I'm receiving a hundred thousand

535
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,320
more get requests than I usually am like

536
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,668
that sort of thing does not get logged

537
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,260
so help our developers not so much for

538
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:28,490
incident response so we have to take

539
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,179
into account into what kind of data

540
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,960
we're gonna look at more over

541
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:36,039
interpretation is actually a pretty

542
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,110
specialized task network admins

543
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:41,870
hopefully know how to interpret traffic

544
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:44,178
graphs and pcaps and logs from their

545
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:47,149
switches and routers Simmons know how to

546
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:47,960
deal with system logs devs and Apple

547
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:51,470
owners should know what their

548
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,429
applications are saying architects oh so

549
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,909
now we're gonna get into some other

550
00:22:52,429 --> 00:23:00,320
stuff architects should know when major

551
00:22:55,909 --> 00:23:02,090
changes have been planned vendors know

552
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,629
this should at least know the log files

553
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,100
that their device is generating and all

554
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,350
of these folks can dig deeper into logs

555
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,418
and have expert knowledge to be able to

556
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,639
interpret them that may not be present

557
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:16,039
on your security team so you're gonna

558
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,080
leverage all of these people I think to

559
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:20,510
get the best bang for your buck because

560
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,860
they know what normal looks like now you

561
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,960
have to you have a choice here you can

562
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,668
either have your security team be

563
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,429
isolated and try to collect all the data

564
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:30,230
themselves and keep it all secret and

565
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:32,299
not tell anybody and say we're in charge

566
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,650
of security or you can reach out and try

567
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:36,799
to make relationships with all these

568
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,059
other teams now Estevan who's in the

569
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,960
audience to give a really interesting

570
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:44,000
talk about this very thing I'm not gonna

571
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,340
quote Esteban's talk extensively but I

572
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,679
will point out that one of the things

573
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,059
that he brings up is security is often

574
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,580
this sort of walled off little group of

575
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:54,320
people who do security stuff and we

576
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,449
don't talk or communicate as much as we

577
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,570
should with the various other groups

578
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:02,840
within our companies this is kind of a

579
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:04,520
bad idea in my opinion because if I

580
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,830
really want to know how an app works and

581
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,750
how that app can be exploited or how

582
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,250
that app can be endangered in some way I

583
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,539
need to talk to the application

584
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,549
developer I need to have a relationship

585
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:15,860
with that person and we need to have a

586
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:17,299
conversation and I need to be able to

587
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,639
say hey we've got this really cool

588
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:21,350
control system like this laughs or

589
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,590
whatever let's work together to figure

590
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,439
out how to configure the laughs

591
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:28,199
that it protects your app and likewise I

592
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,539
need to know from you what kind of

593
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,830
things I should be watching out for if

594
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:34,440
you're see your app start misbehaving

595
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:39,059
tell me because then maybe maybe we can

596
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,590
find an attack earlier right okay there

597
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,559
are some other people too that you might

598
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,090
want to talk to marketing people and I

599
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,490
should say all of these are based on

600
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:52,590
things that I've actually seen the

601
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:54,840
attacks right the marketing people just

602
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,370
did a big campaign big sales campaign

603
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,379
and I get a call from the network house

604
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,719
people saying our utilization on our

605
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,510
websites has gone up by 45% what the

606
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:09,210
hell is going on right turns out not an

607
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:10,320
attack just a good day PR knows when

608
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,429
they just did a press release and

609
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,600
sometimes that's because people are

610
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:14,340
interested in your company and sometimes

611
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,520
is because they've actually managed to

612
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,928
anger somebody okay

613
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,480
sales when they just did a bake sale

614
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:23,309
right finance earnings reports etc all

615
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,990
of these different things they all have

616
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:27,000
situational awareness that might be

617
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,039
useful to you as an incident responder

618
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,600
to know about so that you can accurately

619
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,210
assess whether or not something's an

620
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,678
attack or even better you might actually

621
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,809
find out about these things ahead of

622
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:39,059
time so that you can actually get your

623
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:42,600
monitoring get your scaling ready to go

624
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:44,100
in case something happens oh and of

625
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,730
course the most important one here is

626
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,158
down at the bottom

627
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:50,130
executives really do like to be kept in

628
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,840
the loop I think we all know that it

629
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,070
avoids having them come on to your

630
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,928
conference calls and yell at you a lot

631
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:00,120
okay so how do we make this happen um

632
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:02,880
the first step is clearly communication

633
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,520
who is the security team what kind of

634
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,080
attacks is they have they seen do a

635
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,850
little bit of Education I would

636
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,158
recommend not doing it in such a way

637
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,629
that scares people but just say hey we

638
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,730
live in a world where we get attacked a

639
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,500
lot we need to prepare for it let's

640
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:19,200
calmly and rationally figure out how

641
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,020
we're gonna handle this also not blaming

642
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,659
anybody like your web app is terrible

643
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,309
and we're gonna get you did know just

644
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:27,510
we're all trying to improve the business

645
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:28,770
we're all trying to support business

646
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:32,280
goals let's work together to get this

647
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:34,110
done and mainly saying the security team

648
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,760
will need your help and that's something

649
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,360
else that I see a lot of security teams

650
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,770
and in fact

651
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,659
security teams that I've been on in my

652
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,010
career we have a tendency to kind of

653
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,420
stride into the room and say we're the

654
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:47,490
security team and you're gonna do what

655
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:48,720
we say nobody likes that nobody likes

656
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,450
being told what to do

657
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,350
make it a cooperation make it a making a

658
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,460
partnership and of course

659
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,080
pre-established ways that you can get a

660
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,000
hold of people this has been a really

661
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,169
big thing in the incident responses that

662
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,820
I've been involved in I tell somebody ok

663
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,620
it would be really great to get a packet

664
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,270
capture from the switch that's upstream

665
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,260
from the device that we're looking at

666
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:16,590
oh that's the network ops team okay well

667
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,270
can you get ahold of them maybe just a

668
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:21,090
second

669
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:22,889
ten minutes goes by the one guy I know

670
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,260
is on vacation I don't know who else to

671
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,549
call right or it's or it's 3:00 in the

672
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,309
morning and they're all at home or

673
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:31,740
whatever right working those things out

674
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:34,110
ahead of time with your staff with your

675
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,440
non IT staff with your vendors with your

676
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,360
ISP especially for volumetric attacks is

677
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,890
going to be really important depending

678
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,600
on what kind of stuff your company does

679
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,130
maybe even law enforcement you might

680
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,678
want to have the phone number of the FBI

681
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:51,330
agent locally who might need to know

682
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:53,520
about this coordination is super

683
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,530
important too and I would recommend and

684
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,910
I've seen some success with this playing

685
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:59,160
through attack scenarios on paper

686
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:03,740
wargaming it basically I hate that term

687
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:07,530
let's call it board gaming it yeah okay

688
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:09,350
so basically it is attack simulate yeah

689
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,700
it's still a little aggressive a

690
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:16,260
tabletop okay we got that tabletop

691
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:18,480
tabletop the game out and try to figure

692
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,640
out what kinds of capabilities you need

693
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,650
but don't have and then how you can get

694
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,299
them try to figure out what kind of data

695
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,010
you'd want to see but baby you don't

696
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:30,360
have quite at your fingertips yet and

697
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:32,520
figure out how to get it figure out what

698
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,620
devices you don't have access to as a

699
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,840
security team and maybe get that access

700
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:40,439
or at least coordinate somebody who can

701
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:42,750
get the data off of it that you need and

702
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,059
then you of course document document

703
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,290
document document and then everybody

704
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,580
gets a copy of it and everybody knows

705
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,418
what's supposed to go on that would be

706
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,418
super helpful I think

707
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:54,179
because different groups of people need

708
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:57,210
to be involved in different things you

709
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,740
know a syn flood okay your ISP and your

710
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,360
net ops probably those are the people

711
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,740
who are going to be able to handle it no

712
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,100
need to necessarily involve the app

713
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,540
people in that but if it's a

714
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,850
sophisticated attack against your

715
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,950
customized web app you might need to get

716
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:12,719
everybody involved you might need to get

717
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,280
the PR group involved because your

718
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,540
site's down and they gotta figure out

719
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,220
how they're gonna respond to the media

720
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,770
requests about why is your super cool

721
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,030
site down right I mean I don't know if

722
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:25,139
you work for Twitter and everyone's

723
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:27,899
gonna freak out if Twitter goes down in

724
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:32,220
the third step of course is practice and

725
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,720
this is one of the things that it is

726
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:39,300
actually a little bit difficult

727
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:41,340
sometimes to sell a useful metaphor here

728
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,820
is the way that emergency first

729
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:47,399
responders deal with fires specifically

730
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,830
now EMTs and firefighters respond to

731
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,530
calls constantly right they're very very

732
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:55,379
busy but you might be surprised to find

733
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:58,200
out that only one point five of them one

734
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,770
point five eight percent of them per

735
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,460
year are actually structure fires

736
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,620
firefighters don't spend a great deal of

737
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,840
time fighting fires

738
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:09,060
they are mostly doing other things but

739
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,850
when structure fire does happen they

740
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,889
really need to know what they're doing

741
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:16,429
because the downside of it is that maybe

742
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:18,900
a whole block burns down right it's bad

743
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:21,300
so they spend a great deal of time

744
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,910
drilling about how to fight fires and I

745
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:26,399
would say that drilling how to fight

746
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:29,490
fires in your network drilling how to do

747
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,500
Incident Response is really really

748
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,410
critical to making it something that you

749
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,390
can just do that you don't have to freak

750
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:38,940
out about that it doesn't have to be

751
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,860
super stressful that you can respond

752
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,770
better and faster and you already have

753
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,679
worked out the kinks in your problems

754
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:48,629
before before you get to this point and

755
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,820
make it a lot easier to deal with now

756
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,680
how often well two things actually one

757
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,179
thing is this involves going to your

758
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,500
boss and saying I want to das our

759
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,300
network can I do that

760
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,130
okay that can be kind of a hard sell

761
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,330
some companies are better about this

762
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:04,690
than others but I think I think there's

763
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:06,669
ways to justified or going to a boners

764
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,840
and saying the same thing but hopefully

765
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,340
most of us have tests in dev

766
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,449
environments that we could maybe use for

767
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:15,389
this kind of thing once in a while

768
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:18,340
that might be helpful um so how often

769
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,050
often enough to make it routine right I

770
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:24,159
think we're doing it once a year

771
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:27,460
probably is not enough doing it once a

772
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,290
week is probably too much although maybe

773
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,750
not for your actual incident response

774
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,740
team like your security team but if

775
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,620
you're gonna involve everybody else

776
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,150
maybe too much once a month once a

777
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,830
quarter I don't know something but

778
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,780
enough enough so that people don't

779
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,790
forget between times what they're

780
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,139
supposed to do there's actually some

781
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:46,659
really interesting research mainly in

782
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:50,470
the linguistic world about memory

783
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:53,310
retention it turns out that that you can

784
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:56,260
try to memorize say a bunch of words and

785
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:58,960
you'll remember them all in the short

786
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:01,060
term very well and then it you'll forget

787
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,250
almost all of them but if you then

788
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,810
refresh your memory you'll remember them

789
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:08,680
a little bit longer so there's this idea

790
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:10,659
of spaced repetition if you space it out

791
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,090
if you do it enough you will actually

792
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,160
memorize something but it takes like six

793
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,620
iterations usually before you do that

794
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,810
and you can't do them all at once you

795
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:22,629
have to do them once and then wait like

796
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:24,340
a day or two and then do it like a week

797
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,620
later and then do it a month later and

798
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,570
that's how you get things baked in your

799
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,459
memory I would suggest that that doing

800
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:33,639
this sort of thing is probably amenable

801
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:35,110
to that as well do it frequently enough

802
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,700
so that it doesn't completely fall out

803
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:41,590
of people's brains but not so much that

804
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:44,320
they get overwhelmed by it um just as a

805
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:47,290
side note working with vendors vendors

806
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,389
can be critical partners there is one

807
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,100
big thing that we run into a lot with

808
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:53,260
our customers is that some customers

809
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,260
have security protocols that say we

810
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:58,480
can't share it a with you that makes my

811
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:01,360
job hard

812
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,910
and I understand I mean if you're if

813
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,530
you're you know some kind of black ops

814
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:07,570
site somewhere in the government or

815
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:10,000
something like that maybe I I don't know

816
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:12,129
I for whatever reason some companies

817
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,350
don't feel comfortable or can't legally

818
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,520
share data with me because it might

819
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,709
contain personally identifiable

820
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:22,150
information or IP or whatever they're

821
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:24,340
protecting and that's fine um that does

822
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:27,520
put me into a difficult position so if

823
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:29,049
you are in this particular place work

824
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,879
out ahead of time how you can scrub or

825
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:33,730
redact data so that you can share it

826
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,980
with your vendors you may not be able to

827
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:39,309
give them full packet captures but maybe

828
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:43,179
you can give them that flow data which

829
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:44,470
is just you know IP addresses imports if

830
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:46,780
you want to get sophisticated there are

831
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:49,179
a bunch of tools that can edit pcaps and

832
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:53,799
like say you can give it a list of stuff

833
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:55,630
that you want torn out of it regex is to

834
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:59,440
clean it right you can you can do some

835
00:33:55,630 --> 00:34:00,700
cool stuff with that um maybe you can

836
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,530
get your legal department to help you

837
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,100
get NDA's so that you can share

838
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:06,639
something with us

839
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:09,129
that'd be useful as well and also and

840
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,869
I'll just appeal to everybody here we're

841
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:13,239
supposed to have SLA as vendors hold us

842
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:14,830
to them if we say we're gonna respond on

843
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,540
an hour make sure that we respond in an

844
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:18,639
hour it's it's it's our job to do that

845
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:24,129
so hold just hold our feet to the fire

846
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:26,320
about that please okay so the goal

847
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:28,839
unless it's a in case I haven't been

848
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,429
clear enough we want to try to make sure

849
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,000
that that handling network incidents

850
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:35,950
gets easier and the ways that we do that

851
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,780
is by making it something that is more

852
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:40,290
than just the security operations team

853
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,520
or the incident handling team or the

854
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:43,710
security team or just the network team

855
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,609
or what-have-you

856
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:49,060
more hands are going to make lighter

857
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:50,889
work what we are striving for here is

858
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:54,219
quicker identification quicker

859
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:59,460
resolution and making things not so much

860
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:59,459
of an emergency now

861
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,470
that's kind of the the the high-level

862
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:10,020
basic stuff so let's dig into a little

863
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:12,060
bit more interesting thanks because

864
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:14,220
running scenarios will help you get the

865
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,210
basics sorted and if you're doing that

866
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:18,689
you're gonna be in a pretty good spot

867
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:21,960
but what about the weird things what

868
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,340
about the sophisticated attackers and in

869
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,780
that kind of situation you have to

870
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,970
leverage something which is which is

871
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:29,580
honestly difficult to train for this is

872
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,009
where a quality people on your teams is

873
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,270
going to really make a difference

874
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:35,160
because you need to start getting clever

875
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:37,530
with the data that you have maybe you

876
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,770
don't have data that shows exactly

877
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:44,340
what's going on but maybe you can infer

878
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:46,440
what kind of attack it is by what little

879
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,910
lady you do have so I'm gonna talk about

880
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,930
a couple of different case studies here

881
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,970
the customer called they said they were

882
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:58,049
under attack that's usually how the call

883
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:59,730
the calls start for me now this is also

884
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:02,520
something that tends to happen the

885
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:07,080
attack had already happened and was done

886
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:09,750
with it had subsided before they had

887
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,060
actually gotten anything to take any

888
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,890
action on the attack was gone and this

889
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:15,299
happens for a bunch of reasons but um

890
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,520
it's happening I think rather more and

891
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,070
more we're seeing an increase in in

892
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,300
spiky attacks they hit you for a little

893
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:24,390
bit and then they go away and they hit

894
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:27,120
you for another loan go away um this may

895
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:30,870
be an actual technique to try to screw

896
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:33,180
around with Incident Response like it

897
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:36,089
may also be due to some technical things

898
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:39,240
which I can get into in a second but the

899
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:41,580
customer needed to prepare for the

900
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,750
predicted return of the attack and

901
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,310
that's a pretty good thing I mean

902
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,250
generally speaking and they are going to

903
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:50,330
come back it was this is a very very

904
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,320
very big high-traffic network and it was

905
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,910
what we would generally classify as a

906
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,660
service provider of some kind anyways

907
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:59,100
giant network tons of connections and

908
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,839
they actually did have package capturing

909
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,670
capabilities they'd had some sis central

910
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,440
system that was going to capture packets

911
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,760
on demand and they seemed like they were

912
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,430
pretty well set up except that it was

913
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,930
down during the attack they didn't say

914
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,240
why maybe it was maintenance I don't

915
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:14,180
know but it was down Murphy's Law pays a

916
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,680
big law you know pay plays a big role in

917
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,140
sort of things so they didn't have any

918
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,330
of the attack traffic captured and I

919
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,900
said did you have anything like is there

920
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:25,819
any data that you can share with us that

921
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,200
that took place during the time of the

922
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,270
attack so I can help you out and they

923
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,700
said actually you know what we're

924
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:35,560
testing this new monitoring system that

925
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:38,270
uses ICMP we have full like CMP captures

926
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:43,310
during the time and I was like wow

927
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:48,740
really nobody uses ICMP cool okay send

928
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:50,150
me Orem so I took a look at him it turns

929
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,839
out and that was actually really cool

930
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:57,080
because the dumps that they gave me were

931
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,460
full of ICMP error messages just reams

932
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:05,750
of them right

933
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:07,910
ipv4 and ipv6 and it was a large capture

934
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,380
file and was almost entirely ICMP errors

935
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,870
and more importantly it was almost

936
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,720
entirely host unreachable port

937
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:16,640
unreachable errors so at this point I

938
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,740
started thinking about what could

939
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,450
possibly cause that in a network well

940
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,919
those errors are generated when you get

941
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,960
a traffic some kind of traffic that

942
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,180
comes in and it's trying to go to a

943
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,300
particular IP import that doesn't have a

944
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:31,120
listener on it right so okay that gives

945
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,410
me one little bit of information

946
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:36,200
the funny thing or the cool thing about

947
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:37,940
ICMP error messages of this type is that

948
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,649
not only do they include the ICMP error

949
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,210
message and of course all of the IP

950
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,790
headers that go along with that but they

951
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:45,460
also include the IP header of the

952
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:51,500
traffic that's stimulated the error and

953
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:55,910
they include at least 576 bytes of the

954
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:57,500
data portion of that as well not sure

955
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:01,370
about that number if I were six bits I

956
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:03,230
don't know there's some amount so what

957
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:07,940
did I know so far well I've got traffic

958
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:12,470
from port 53 UDP going to some random

959
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:15,260
AHA high port in their network oh I see

960
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:16,339
here it says eight bytes okay I should

961
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,460
probably read my slides more carefully

962
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:22,730
anyways it can be it can be a variable

963
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:25,250
amount so what did I do well because I'm

964
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:27,710
old I fired up Perl and I loaded a bunch

965
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:29,270
of net modules and I

966
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,619
tore apart the packet capture and I got

967
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:33,589
rid of the IP header and I got rid of

968
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:35,420
the ICMP header and what was I left with

969
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:40,339
well I was left with the actual attack

970
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:42,380
traffic cool um I had enough it wasn't

971
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:45,410
full I couldn't reconstruct a peak app

972
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:47,390
from it but I had the mid enough of the

973
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:51,348
attack traffic to be able to say this is

974
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:53,540
DNS traffic okay moreover this was a and

975
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:56,359
quad a records and there was DNS

976
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:58,040
responses that was coming out so I was

977
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:00,348
able to conclude that what I was seeing

978
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,779
was evidence of a reflected DNS attack

979
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:05,000
in other words the attacker was from a

980
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,910
spoofed IP that was spoofed to be the

981
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,089
target sending a request to Adeena

982
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:13,430
server that was then sending a response

983
00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:15,109
to hit the target right and this showed

984
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:17,960
up in the ICMP error logs it's a very

985
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:19,970
common attack technique you see it all

986
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,410
the time but it did give us some ability

987
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,819
to be able to say okay well what can we

988
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,460
do to help with this right well we can

989
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,020
we can block DNS responses from coming

990
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,580
into your network unless they're

991
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,140
actually going to your DNS server that

992
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:33,319
has a legitimate reason for making them

993
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:36,109
or we can improve your state with stable

994
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,910
stateful firewall config to knotek's to

995
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:39,830
just drop packets that don't have some

996
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:41,359
kind of a connection table entry that

997
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:45,080
would indicate that you know it was an

998
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,609
actual legitimate response it's pretty

999
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,250
happy about that that one worked out

1000
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:51,560
pretty well umm it's actually gotten me

1001
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,550
to the point to say you know ICMP that's

1002
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,839
been around since the beginning of the

1003
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,160
internet why are we turning that off

1004
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,520
everywhere well there are some good

1005
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:04,089
reasons to not permit ICMP to be emitted

1006
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:07,430
from your edge except for maybe doing

1007
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:08,990
path MTU discovery but inside your land

1008
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:15,109
it can be very useful you might want to

1009
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:20,330
think about not just turning it off the

1010
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:21,529
next one was was a fun one I was on the

1011
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,630
phone with the customer and they were

1012
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:25,700
like our switches and the proxy devices

1013
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,950
that I support were just kind of blowing

1014
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:31,069
up they were having to reboot them all

1015
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,810
the time the load was surprised what's

1016
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,310
going on we think we're under a massive

1017
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:37,310
dose help help help

1018
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:38,750
okay this was affecting their production

1019
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,460
this was affecting their ability to

1020
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,560
serve up the webpages they needed to

1021
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,390
serve up

1022
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,250
the customer really did not know how to

1023
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,990
go about handling it at all but they

1024
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,580
knew at least that the the main

1025
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:51,890
indicator that they had was that their

1026
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,540
switches and this proxy was just

1027
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:57,440
freaking out right so that's where they

1028
00:41:53,540 --> 00:42:00,610
focus their attention so what I ended up

1029
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,050
doing was checking around the problem

1030
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:04,820
essentially right because it's good to

1031
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,140
get enough awareness of what's going on

1032
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,500
throughout the entire network to try to

1033
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,819
figure out how to deal with it um the

1034
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,280
network device load was super high but

1035
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,120
the inbound edge of their network was

1036
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,340
just normal

1037
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,480
they had graphs for that it was just the

1038
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,570
same kind of traffic that they always

1039
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,520
saw and their application servers

1040
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,840
weren't heavily loaded either even

1041
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,990
though people weren't able to get to the

1042
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,790
web pages so that gave me a little bit

1043
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,799
of a tip that maybe it was actually

1044
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,080
constrained to just these two devices

1045
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:37,340
right or at least somewhere in between

1046
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:39,319
the edge and the core so I managed to

1047
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,660
get a quick peak app and I managed to

1048
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:45,650
see that the TCP sequence numbers were

1049
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:48,140
the same a lot even though there was you

1050
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,490
know from inbound and outbound but the

1051
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,430
Macan source addresses were swapping

1052
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:58,279
back and forth well okay so anybody care

1053
00:42:52,430 --> 00:43:04,100
to guess what this was kind of routing

1054
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:05,870
loop well so broadly speaking a routing

1055
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,339
loop I guess essentially what was

1056
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,630
happening was the switch was sending to

1057
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,890
the proxy which was sending to the

1058
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,080
switch was just like and did the proxy

1059
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:14,810
which is going to be this way so on and

1060
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,799
so forth we corrected the configuration

1061
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:21,350
issue that was causing that and

1062
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:23,840
everything went away all right okay on

1063
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:27,250
Tara through the rest of this some

1064
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:29,360
general discussion of specific issues

1065
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,920
these are a few little techniques that I

1066
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,260
found useful in doing these sort of

1067
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,120
things if you do not if you do not have

1068
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,010
the budget to do full-on packet captures

1069
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,810
for everything or you don't have a ton

1070
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,490
of ability to do this or actually this

1071
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,340
is really specifically useful when

1072
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:45,560
you're doing a lot of cloud deployments

1073
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,970
you can do packet you can do constant

1074
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,279
packet captures into essentially

1075
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:52,189
circular buffers at each our supports

1076
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,010
this you can also just have it

1077
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:56,270
configured to dump into a bunch of files

1078
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,550
you can limit the file size

1079
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:01,520
automatically and you can have it you

1080
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:04,010
know so you can have six files that are

1081
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,800
all ten Meg's or whatever if you have

1082
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,150
that constantly running and you suddenly

1083
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,370
think oh I'm under attack

1084
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:12,350
you've actually got attack data now you

1085
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:13,819
don't actually have to go and start the

1086
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,680
capture and get it you actually have the

1087
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,030
data that you need so you just copy that

1088
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,690
over to snap it over whatever you need

1089
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:22,610
to do to get it can be very useful and

1090
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:24,110
simple counters are often overlooked but

1091
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,760
they are often the way that we diagnose

1092
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:27,110
these things how many HTTP requests are

1093
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,460
you getting how many how many TCP

1094
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,620
requests are you getting you can have

1095
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:33,590
graph it see trending data right because

1096
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:35,720
all of a sudden HTTP traffic HTTP

1097
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:38,450
traffic right now you know it's an HTTP

1098
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,919
attack it seems really simple but the

1099
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,910
number of times that I see people

1100
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,170
struggling to get this kind of data

1101
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:46,640
ahead of time is pretty big other things

1102
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:48,230
like average size request I mean you can

1103
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,970
go really down the rabbit hole with this

1104
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,050
depending on what your applications are

1105
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:54,020
and what your sort of things are doing

1106
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:58,310
but this sort of simple counters and

1107
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:59,900
graphing can be super super useful for a

1108
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:01,490
general methodology of how to assess

1109
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,680
Network attacks that at least I've

1110
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,600
developed when I'm talking to people is

1111
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,940
I ask the following questions in the

1112
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,460
following order are your inbound or up

1113
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:13,760
on pipes saturated that tells me a bunch

1114
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:15,680
that tells me whether or not I'm dealing

1115
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,580
with a giant volumetric attack or am I'm

1116
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:21,440
dealing with something else attacks can

1117
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:24,860
be both volumetric and something else

1118
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,390
like a I've seen brute force attacks

1119
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:29,450
against web servers that have actually

1120
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,680
filled network pipes not all attackers

1121
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,759
understand that they need to kind of

1122
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,910
keep it low and slow

1123
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,740
some people just blast you I'm also

1124
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:38,660
volumetric attacks are a great way to

1125
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,950
conceal other things because you have

1126
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,660
the network ops team running around

1127
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:43,759
trying to deal with the with the massive

1128
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:46,549
UDP flood and they're not going to see

1129
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,680
the attempts to compromise the web

1130
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:52,370
server using a node a or whatever so

1131
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:53,750
it's useful thing to know but it gives

1132
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:56,509
you a some chance to prioritize what's

1133
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:59,360
important then I move up a level

1134
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:02,090
is it TCP is that UDP is that ICMP is it

1135
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,680
GRE whatever and then if that doesn't

1136
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:05,540
give me enough information then I say

1137
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,230
what else having broker hole is it web

1138
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:11,470
is it as sage is it

1139
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:13,940
and then finally if I get to that point

1140
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,379
do I need to actually get into the into

1141
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,270
encrypted traffic to figure out what's

1142
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,800
going on so essentially what I'm doing

1143
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:22,759
here is I'm going from the easiest to

1144
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:26,630
the hardest if at any point during this

1145
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:29,150
I can say bingo that is traffic that I

1146
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:31,730
can identify as being a hostile in a

1147
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:34,670
very positive sense like I can

1148
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:37,970
distinguish that traffic from legitimate

1149
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:39,860
traffic that's where I stop that's where

1150
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:41,089
I start looking for mitigations right

1151
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,370
because I'm not gonna go and do a

1152
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,950
full-on investigation of this if what I

1153
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:47,000
really want to do is just make it stop

1154
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:49,520
so if I can get to the point where I can

1155
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,220
say okay we have something we can we can

1156
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,660
hang our hat on now let's immediately go

1157
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,279
and try to figure out what the best way

1158
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:58,850
to remediate this is this is where I

1159
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,380
stop and usually that's by basing it on

1160
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:02,390
some kind of unique characteristic maybe

1161
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,640
all the attack traffic is coming from

1162
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:07,850
one IP we actually see that that's kind

1163
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,580
of weird but we see that maybe it has to

1164
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:15,440
do with all of the attack traffic is

1165
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:18,020
HTTP and the host header is blank we see

1166
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,600
that or it has a bizarre user agent

1167
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,680
string or whatever you can generally

1168
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,080
eventually get to the point where you

1169
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:27,950
can figure out some way to block it and

1170
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:30,259
if you can't keep digging I know this is

1171
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:32,000
a big thing encrypted traffic everybody

1172
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,680
wants to encrypt everything I am very

1173
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,120
much a positive fan of that I think

1174
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,930
that's great but you do actually need

1175
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:41,210
the ability to look into it sometimes

1176
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:44,020
you can do that in a number of different

1177
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:46,850
ways depending on your security policy

1178
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:49,190
this is where application logging if you

1179
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:50,779
if you happen to run custom apps this

1180
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:52,490
might actually be super useful if you

1181
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,650
have some logging capability in your app

1182
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:57,529
to actually dumped out payloads of the

1183
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:59,720
requests that it's handling that way you

1184
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:03,080
don't have to like mess around with

1185
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:08,290
decrypting and Riaan crypting to satisfy

1186
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:12,049
those requirements you can use proxies

1187
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:14,720
such as the one that I work for to do

1188
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:17,510
that though and get insight into those

1189
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,649
traffic's or you can do things which I

1190
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:20,270
wouldn't recommend which is like

1191
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:20,930
downgrading the crypto so that you can

1192
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:23,630
capture the poll

1193
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:26,149
and shake and use the RSA keys to get

1194
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:28,160
into it everyone should really be using

1195
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:29,660
a femoral difficult an ACC or something

1196
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,578
along those lines that offers perfect

1197
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:33,520
forward secrecy

1198
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:37,369
so what's let's try to avoid doing that

1199
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,809
along with that um cloud issues

1200
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:40,130
everybody's moving to the cloud the

1201
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:44,809
cloud is just a bunch of computers that

1202
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:47,210
you don't control but they do have

1203
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:48,260
dashboards and stats and you should know

1204
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:51,020
what those are and be able to leverage

1205
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:52,520
them one of the funny things about the

1206
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,869
cloud is that mitigations that you might

1207
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,880
have in your network or things that they

1208
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:58,040
offer services hey you might need to pay

1209
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,450
some money for those there's basic

1210
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,069
firewalling obviously there's some other

1211
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:02,808
things like that but I know Amazon and

1212
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:05,119
other cloud providers are providing web

1213
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:07,609
application firewalls those may or may

1214
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,660
not meet your needs but you should

1215
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:10,328
definitely check into them and figure

1216
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,859
out whether they're worth the money

1217
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:14,180
especially in DevOps environments which

1218
00:49:12,859 --> 00:49:16,670
I get to a little bit more in a second

1219
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:18,980
um you may not know where your cloud

1220
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:23,540
stuff is deployed depending on your

1221
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:25,190
development model and you they may or

1222
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:28,160
may not know how to turn on logging or

1223
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:29,960
do packet captures on those so but if

1224
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,808
you can figure that out scripted use

1225
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:34,760
orchestration use kubernetes use ansible

1226
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:36,799
whatever to be able to like push a

1227
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,450
config that says turn on debug logging

1228
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:40,490
and get me a pack of capture that would

1229
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:41,710
be useful right you can just do it like

1230
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:44,000
that

1231
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:47,599
DevOps or as I've recently heard it

1232
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:51,319
called dev net sec ops apparently we're

1233
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,809
converging all of us is great but it's

1234
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:55,400
increasingly replacing traditional

1235
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:56,599
functions of system administration and

1236
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,980
network administration but it's

1237
00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:00,319
replacing it with people who may not

1238
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,579
have the full set of skills in either

1239
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,890
one of those things right you mean we

1240
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:06,619
have Deb's and Deb's are able to now

1241
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,790
spin up instances in the cloud and do a

1242
00:50:06,619 --> 00:50:09,020
bunch of networking with Software

1243
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:10,849
Defined Networking and so forth and it

1244
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:13,009
works generally really really well and

1245
00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:14,839
they don't have to worry about it and

1246
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,770
that's great because we can reduce the

1247
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:17,720
amount of money that we're spending on

1248
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:20,630
network teams and system in teams and so

1249
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:23,209
forth ok ok but what happens when it's a

1250
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:26,450
security thing they don't necessarily

1251
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:28,549
know enough about it they know how to

1252
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:29,930
spin them up they know how to auto scale

1253
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:32,660
them and that can be useful during a

1254
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:34,009
DAWs but what happens if somebody is

1255
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,640
actually triggering a vulnerability in

1256
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:36,319
your app and

1257
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,000
hanging down all your instances who's

1258
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,190
the person that you go to talk to about

1259
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,230
that how do you get access to the

1260
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:44,240
configs how do you make the changes that

1261
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,079
you need to do quickly that's the

1262
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,368
question that essentially that I'm

1263
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:51,289
asking and sophisticated attacks here

1264
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:53,809
really it's just distinguishable that l7

1265
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:57,170
is how I would describe that and able to

1266
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:58,760
change quickly oh this is what I was

1267
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:01,549
going to say so what we're seeing a lot

1268
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,200
of is wave attacks there is some debate

1269
00:51:01,549 --> 00:51:05,509
in the community about whether or not

1270
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,089
this is actually a technique or whether

1271
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:09,710
this is just a side effect if it's a

1272
00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:12,619
technique what the attackers are doing

1273
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:14,750
is they're blasting you super hard

1274
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:18,019
there's no ramp up it's just like from 0

1275
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:20,900
to 100 boom for a short period of time

1276
00:51:18,019 --> 00:51:23,868
and then they go away and then 6 hours

1277
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,430
later they come back boom go away it's

1278
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:26,839
super disruptive to your business it

1279
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,759
reduces the amount of time that you have

1280
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:31,279
to do anything it's actually a pretty

1281
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,859
effective attack technique some people

1282
00:51:31,279 --> 00:51:35,990
who study this stuff think that it's an

1283
00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:37,700
actual technique some people think it's

1284
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:40,189
because the botnets that are doing this

1285
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:42,259
are just blasting giant net blocks and

1286
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:44,809
when they sweep around you you're a

1287
00:51:42,259 --> 00:51:47,890
little bit you see it and then they go

1288
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:50,240
on to the next part and that goes away

1289
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:55,009
don't know either way the effect is the

1290
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:57,319
same though but in these situations

1291
00:51:55,009 --> 00:51:58,490
especially and especially attackers who

1292
00:51:57,319 --> 00:52:01,430
are actually trying to trigger

1293
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:03,589
vulnerabilities you absolutely need to

1294
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:09,009
have tight relationships with your app

1295
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:09,009
teams to be able to address these ok

1296
00:52:09,069 --> 00:52:17,109
that was a little bit unfocused in all

1297
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:17,109
over the place but I hope you enjoyed it

1298
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:21,259
essentially the main things that I'd

1299
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:22,910
like you to take away from it are there

1300
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:24,559
there aren't any vendor magic bullets

1301
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:25,269
for this stuff there are tools that can

1302
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,920
be helpful

1303
00:52:25,269 --> 00:52:29,240
there are definitely tools that can give

1304
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,950
you insight and the ability to

1305
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:33,348
manipulate traffic in your networks in

1306
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:36,500
ways that can be very useful but you

1307
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:39,349
still obviously need people who know how

1308
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,759
to use them and can do this sort of

1309
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:42,769
thing and that incident response

1310
00:52:40,759 --> 00:52:45,160
absolutely needs to be a function not

1311
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:48,879
only of your security team but also of

1312
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:52,879
just about everybody else

1313
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:55,190
that analysis and response is better

1314
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,380
done by the subject matter experts than

1315
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,580
the security team so if you work in

1316
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,610
cooperation you're going to get better

1317
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:03,140
results and that the means to do this is

1318
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:05,240
by communicating ahead of time

1319
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:10,310
establishing relationships with those

1320
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:11,930
groups and doing some we're gonna

1321
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:14,960
pretend we're under attack while not

1322
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:17,330
being under attack scenarios so that you

1323
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,850
can get all the bugs worked out early

1324
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:23,060
you can deal with the easy to deal with

1325
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:25,368
attacks quicker and better you can be

1326
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:26,810
less stressed out and then you'll still

1327
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,369
have the energy to be able to deal with

1328
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:31,850
the really sophisticated attacks that

1329
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:34,010
you might get so that's what I've got to

1330
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:35,868
say we have two minutes for questions if

1331
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:38,090
anybody has any or you can all go out

1332
00:53:35,869 --> 00:53:41,360
and get some coffee or whatever you want

1333
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:47,219
so thanks very much for coming

1334
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:47,219
[Applause]

1335
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:59,210
anybody have a question yes um I can get

1336
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,859
you these slides have you found them

1337
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:05,000
useful that we are also being recorded

1338
00:54:00,859 --> 00:54:06,290
so depending on how well the recording

1339
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,520
turns out I probably could get you a

1340
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:11,600
copy of that too yeah and and if you

1341
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,650
want to give me your card or whatever

1342
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:18,618
I'll make sure I can get you this

1343
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:20,920
material anybody else no all right cool

1344
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:20,920

1345

you
