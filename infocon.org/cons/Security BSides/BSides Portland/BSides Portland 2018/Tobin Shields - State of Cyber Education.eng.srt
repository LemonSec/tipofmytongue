1
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,349
today's talk really isn't I have a

2
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,450
teacher voice oh I might walk in and out

3
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,360
of the mic so today's talk really

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,310
focuses on two things one if you have

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,380
been out of the education industry for a

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,020
while and by awhile you mean like five

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:33,200
or ten years or you never touched cyber

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,420
education it's really good for you to

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,820
know as veteran security professionals

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,160
to know how our future educators

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,390
actually getting educated what are the

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,639
kinds of skills that they're actually

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,070
learning from and more importantly I'm

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,560
gonna be a little critical of the

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,970
security education industry so I want to

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,260
start first of all by saying all my

17
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,060
thoughts are my own and not mount hoods

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,550
even though that the giant logo is right

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,590
there because I am going to be critical

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,930
of some of the ways that I think that

21
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,730
cyber education is failing not just our

22
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,800
students but also the industry as well

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,689
but I'm also really excited to honor and

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,460
be really pumped about what we're doing

25
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:09,110
well and I think that that's one of the

26
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,960
really great things about this B track

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,119
is that it is really focusing on how do

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,030
we encourage the professionals within

29
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:19,310
our industry to skill up and how do we

30
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,290
bring people into this industry so that

31
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,510
not only that they're qualified but

32
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,310
they're not miss qualified right so that

33
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,870
we're not teaching too old technology or

34
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,440
that we're teaching the right technology

35
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,940
for our given community so the

36
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,530
obligatory Who am I by the way this is

37
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,979
my favorite cybersecurity joke ever of

38
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,210
all time so I am a cyber security and

39
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,280
information security instructor at

40
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,449
Mountain Community College my degree

41
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,400
nonsense I have a master's in cyber

42
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,540
security which is pretty new thing by

43
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,040
the way so you have to get it online

44
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,500
there's not a ton

45
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,530
I think OSU and does this PSU offer an

46
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,720
MS in cyber security do you know so it's

47
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,310
it tends to be overwhelmingly a computer

48
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,560
science track right which for many of

49
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,909
you know if you are really into develop

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,690
in computer science that doesn't

51
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,909
necessarily mean that you're going

52
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,950
really heavy into IT and cyber right so

53
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:05,690
it's kind of cool come a new thing but I

54
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,190
actually came originally I was a k-12

55
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,649
educator so I also have a master's

56
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,900
degree in education and weirdly enough I

57
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,340
have a bachelor's in English so talking

58
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,780
a lot about the humanity is the crossing

59
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,180
of Technology it's really I feel like

60
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,939
that does aid me personally but again we

61
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,319
are track on getting where we are today

62
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:24,380
and for those of you who care about

63
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,470
certifications I am a ceh I I really

64
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,299
didn't want this one this is

65
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,950
my master's program I'm not really big

66
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,890
in a forensics but I have it and I am

67
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,079
CompTIA Security+ so I want to talk

68
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,910
first of all about the talent gap how

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,980
many of you have heard a headline or

70
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,170
know about the cybersecurity talent gap

71
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,269
that exists okay so I literally typed

72
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,369
into Google like last night talent gap

73
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,910
and I was able to grab these headlines

74
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,740
all published in 2018 now I will say I

75
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,660
think there's a lot of fear-mongering I

76
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,760
think that there's a lot of vendors

77
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,049
trying to sell certifications right so

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,149
you're trying to get as many people into

79
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,610
the workforce as possible but there is a

80
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,010
consensus that there is a skill gap that

81
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,410
exists within cybersecurity and has

82
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,049
anyone ever tried to hire someone in

83
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,760
cyber like maybe like or let me rephrase

84
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,130
that how many do they say that generally

85
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,840
it's either it's either neutral or hard

86
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,670
to find a good cyber person when you're

87
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,709
recruiting okay that's true right

88
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,540
neutral the hard whereas like when I

89
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:19,890
went to apply as an English teacher a

90
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,480
high school English teacher there were

91
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,670
300 other applicants that were more

92
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,260
qualified than me right so that

93
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,619
definitely it's not an industry where we

94
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:32,970
have a glutton of talent as anyone knows

95
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,550
cyber seek work so this is a will called

96
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,880
a research project published by burning

97
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,590
glass Bureau of Labor Statistics and

98
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,209
certification providers so CompTIA e CH

99
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,080
things like that and what they decided

100
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,580
to do is pull a ton of open source data

101
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,730
places like burning glass and decom

102
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,950
monster to basically say how many open

103
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,510
jobs are there in cybersecurity now

104
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,040
we're looking at this at the nation

105
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,298
level and what we're seeing is that

106
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,910
there are seven hundred and sixty eight

107
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,850
thousand or so currently employed in

108
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,829
cyber security that there are over 300

109
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,739
thousand open positions in cyber

110
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,780
security that's a lot right especially

111
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,850
at a national level but what's cool

112
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,799
about this map is that you can also

113
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,409
break it down not just by state but also

114
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,608
even large metro areas where a lot of

115
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,790
this information comes from

116
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:21,839
and according to site receipt org so you

117
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,630
always take all this stuff leave it with

118
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,909
a grain of salt and there supposedly

119
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,500
2,400 open cyber security positions in

120
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,880
the Portland metro area and I would see

121
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,040
Portland metro not she talking downtown

122
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,840
but also you know the city of Gresham

123
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,190
that needs an IT person Mount Hood

124
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,169
Community College who literally just

125
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,610
hired their very first security analyst

126
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,109
in their own IT

127
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,280
Department so we're not talking about

128
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,199
the big pull you know the big players

129
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,638
but also just your general IT staff and

130
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,990
in general IT departments that's

131
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,030
realizing they need a security but

132
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:52,080
security professional for the first time

133
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:54,210
so as an educator my job always is to

134
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,870
try and train my students for high wage

135
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,370
high need jobs right because and again I

136
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,259
came from a liberal arts background when

137
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,240
I got a bachelor's in English I knew

138
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,370
that the job market for the English

139
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,080
major is limited to say the least now

140
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,199
there's journalists and there's writing

141
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,060
and I don't I don't bash my experience

142
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,039
it was such a rewarding experience to

143
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,199
engage in the humanities like that but

144
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,150
we're talking about a career pipeline

145
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,789
it's kind of a scary thing to train

146
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,859
someone up in right so for me as an

147
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,719
educator one of my personal passions is

148
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,599
to make sure that I'm doubling down on

149
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:29,669
skills that not only are useful and

150
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:31,529
needed in the industry but will give my

151
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:33,659
students liveable and even high wage

152
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:35,490
jobs that's my personal commitment and

153
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:36,960
in the community that I serve which is

154
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,150
Gresham which is you know a suburb of

155
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,340
Portland but Gresham nonetheless we have

156
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,870
a lot of people who really need that

157
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,698
opportunity who needs to be able to

158
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,180
bring themselves out of a situation and

159
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:51,120
cybersecurity right now is one of the I

160
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,759
think easiest and most important ways to

161
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,860
fill that so we see this giant skills

162
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,539
gap that exists and so educational

163
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,830
institutions are trying really hard to

164
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:03,568
jump on this and fulfill this need again

165
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,800
the obligatory so again this is the

166
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,080
fear-mongering right

167
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,060
supposedly Symantec published in 2015

168
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,979
that there will be six million jobs in

169
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,949
cybersecurity globally with a shortfall

170
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,659
of 1.5 million another study shows it as

171
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,889
two million shortfall right so we're

172
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:20,039
rising and how many people are gonna be

173
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:21,659
missing and this is probably the most

174
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,779
insane number but 3.5 million

175
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:26,339
cybersecurity openings by 2021 okay

176
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,589
let's just say for instance it's even a

177
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,569
fraction of that number that is still an

178
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:33,810
amazing opportunity we're talking about

179
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:35,849
zero percent unemployment in an industry

180
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,830
where you have like my dad who worked

181
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:38,938
for Holly a video god rest the soul of

182
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,339
Blockbuster and Holly we have video

183
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,169
right right you know you have industries

184
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,120
fading right Millennials not buying this

185
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:47,580
or that killing industries and yet you

186
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,190
have a 0% unemployment rate that's only

187
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,020
going up right now so again I don't buy

188
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,180
into this but at the same time as

189
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,740
educator I try and look at generally

190
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,830
what's being said and I try and build

191
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:02,190
programs that can honor and like I said

192
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:04,800
push students into filling these jobs um

193
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:07,020
and kind of an interesting snapshot we

194
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,789
graduate who's we have about 60 to 80

195
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,650
students in our program at any given

196
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:12,659
time which means that we graduate what

197
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,919
30 or 40 students a year and our program

198
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:17,159
which is pretty good for a small program

199
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,229
so even if there truly are 2400 open

200
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:21,300
jobs in the area we're only we're

201
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:23,060
hitting a small dent right and let's

202
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,889
just say all of the Portland metro area

203
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,599
graduated 300 cyber focus right and

204
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:28,560
we're not just talking about developers

205
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,060
right because students who have

206
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,860
bachelor's degrees computer science

207
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,229
they're filling all the programming jobs

208
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,580
although all the dev jobs right so even

209
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:38,400
if we optimistically say we're

210
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,130
graduating 300 students a year right to

211
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,469
do math right 3 6 9 12 it's like 5 6 7

212
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,270
years before we can even fill the open

213
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:46,889
jobs that exist right now there are

214
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,080
plenty of other tracks not through

215
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,180
education to get an info sack how many

216
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,969
of you don't have a formal education in

217
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,830
the in info sack right so that's the

218
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:57,780
reason it's because we're reaching out

219
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,150
to non-traditional ways to fill these

220
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,869
roles because education isn't filling it

221
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,489
fast enough so if you were to walk away

222
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,919
from anything in this whole talk this is

223
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,630
the core thing if educators are not

224
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,698
staying current teaching the right

225
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,680
skills and setting the right standards

226
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,810
then you are stuck with terrible

227
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,440
co-workers and everyone just has a bad

228
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:22,050
time all right so I need and when I say

229
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,430
I I'm I'm representing the education

230
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,900
community but I'm not actually putting

231
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,180
words in anyone else's mouth we need

232
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,810
your help as an educational institution

233
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,539
we need to lean on industry partners for

234
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,578
a lot of different reasons to ensure

235
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,740
that you have awesome and high talent

236
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:40,010
peers to be filling those critical

237
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,880
positions within your organization so

238
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,670
who's actually teaching information

239
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,399
security this is a brand new field when

240
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,410
it comes to education now I have worked

241
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,610
in the public sector long enough to know

242
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:56,490
how slow and sluggish government is and

243
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,589
has Justin talked in his earlier talk he

244
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,930
was you know I Sai projected a date for

245
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,459
getting some interns into silence like

246
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,849
in a year from now right because that's

247
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,258
how slow

248
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,940
works he's like no let's do it this

249
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:10,959
summer and that was like mind-blowing to

250
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,339
me right and so the fact that a lot of

251
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,540
four-year institutions are adopting

252
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,829
cybersecurity is actually really

253
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,130
impressive especially on the rate that

254
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:22,569
they're doing it so I'm missing I'm sure

255
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:24,040
I'm missing things here however the way

256
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:25,479
that I split them up and this might be

257
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,849
an inappropriate split I'm sure that

258
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,800
people the CS focus degrees will get mad

259
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,959
at me but generally speaking there are

260
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,939
two major tracks that schools were

261
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,800
trained cyber security one I call IT

262
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,589
focus which tends to lives in their

263
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,240
business IT colleges really focuses on

264
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:42,040
networking hardware infrastructure

265
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,569
versus you taste someone who has a

266
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,430
computer science degree which is

267
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:48,550
typically you know development

268
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,469
programming data science that then they

269
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,579
lay or something on top of it so they'll

270
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,990
maybe say okay you know you've taken

271
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:54,459
your core fundamental development

272
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,410
courses and now you can either get a

273
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:58,989
minor or a focus area in a given

274
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,480
particular field of cyber and that tends

275
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,250
to be things like AI deep learning

276
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,800
cryptography things that really lean on

277
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,540
that development background right a bit

278
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,490
more often than not you don't have the

279
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,810
CS focus degrees saying all right here's

280
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,009
how you plug in a Cisco router and

281
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,810
here's how your network interface card

282
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:15,100
works right and that's because they're

283
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,180
just two different beasts right like I

284
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,610
have no business teaching data

285
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,008
structures I'd zero concept of what that

286
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,209
even means right but I have business

287
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:24,579
talking about networks and network

288
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:26,529
interface cards right so again these are

289
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:28,149
the two Cal as was mentioned earlier is

290
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,009
actually a vocational tech high school

291
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:31,990
that has been teaching cybersecurity a

292
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:34,060
two-year focused program for almost five

293
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,560
years now which is really cool

294
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,660
Mount Hood Community College was the

295
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,399
first Community College in the state of

296
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,610
Oregon to be offering cyber education

297
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,470
and as a very recently Chemeketa

298
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,079
Community College is now pioneering a

299
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,449
cybersecurity program as well PCC offers

300
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,949
I think they call it a certificate it's

301
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:53,229
like three classes you can take so

302
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:55,329
there's definitely a lot of push right

303
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:59,050
now and trying to get cyber education in

304
00:10:55,329 --> 00:11:00,279
traditional colleges PSU I know offers a

305
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,680
40-degree of course in computer science

306
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:04,839
but I think is it a minor in

307
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,630
cybersecurity or what it what exactly is

308
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,819
it certificate okay so definitely you

309
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,560
know students are going through that BS

310
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:13,719
program have a great option to go

311
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,969
through and sort of get exposed to a lot

312
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,740
of really cool facets of cyber George

313
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,420
Fox actually did just release

314
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,640
focus area as well but again it's

315
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,719
computer science focus UFO is a

316
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,920
four-year institution they do have a

317
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,560
master's degree in computer science and

318
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,790
information assurance and same with OSU

319
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,589
but one of the things that and this is

320
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,329
where I'm gonna talk initially about the

321
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,370
things that we do well are the things

322
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,990
that we don't do well if I want to look

323
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,910
at a student right now and I want to

324
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,950
tell them okay they want a degree in

325
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,180
cyber right like I'm looking at a 16

326
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,130
year old when I was teaching in k-12

327
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,109
well I'll tell them okay well if you

328
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,700
want a degree in cyber that's not a

329
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,710
two-year because some people just don't

330
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,290
like the two years then they have to go

331
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,220
through a full four years maybe at PSU

332
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,719
where they're able to get a really great

333
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,640
certificate and then they have to go to

334
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,350
a master's degree where they're

335
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,300
primarily focusing thing on threat

336
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,910
research malware right the stuff that

337
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,819
requires just ultra in-depth knowledge

338
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,959
of cyber security systems but if they're

339
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,550
like I'm just really pumped about

340
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,190
defending a network well you don't need

341
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,839
a masters for that right in fact it's

342
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,450
and I love that term it's more like the

343
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,760
blue-collar work of cybersecurity which

344
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,890
is to be honest where a lot of those

345
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
open jobs are and of course there's

346
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,189
plenty of open jobs for those master's

347
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,080
degrees right and plenty of open jobs

348
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,870
for even those bachelor's degrees but we

349
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,580
need to be filling all ranges of the

350
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,740
industry and we need to have our

351
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,110
educational institutions successfully

352
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,550
doing that and again so that's

353
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,620
information technology and there's not

354
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,930
anyone or right answer we have jobs of

355
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,570
course in both itn and computer science

356
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,640
or data learning I am of the camp of

357
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,100
information technology that's where my

358
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,660
program primarily lives but I still

359
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,680
encourage students to go into computer

360
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,300
science if they're really pumped about

361
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,170
development and programming and secure

362
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,939
coding so like I said Cal is in Gresham

363
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,040
I won't spend too much on that they do a

364
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,180
lot of great CIS courses so cows are

365
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,250
really great school and of course Mount

366
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,569
Hood we are incredibly certification

367
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,470
focused now some of you're like oh cool

368
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,330
I have some of those and some of you

369
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,120
like oh god I could hate certifications

370
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,370
right I put this here not because we're

371
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,690
slave to certification so much as I like

372
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,670
to let you guys know that our students

373
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,140
go through the equivalent of like how

374
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,479
many of you have a CCNA or at least have

375
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,280
know what that training is like if you

376
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,560
are CCNA even if you don't value the

377
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,150
cert at least value the rigor it takes

378
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,890
and the knowledge that the students at

379
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,380
least have as a result of those

380
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,180
certifications so students who have no

381
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,800
knowledge of networking go through our

382
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,040
curriculum sure they might get the

383
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,660
certification or not

384
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,709
least they know what a network heart is

385
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,630
and they know how to configure those

386
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:38,359
networks so they go through the Cisco

387
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,860
series a plus is sort of our primer if

388
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,660
you guys are familiar with the A+ it's

389
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,550
like help desk right helping us stuff

390
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,589
how to build a computer you know basics

391
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,240
of networking but again we have so many

392
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:48,649
students who are like I have no idea

393
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,750
what a computer is right so it's a

394
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:52,550
really important primer we do Linux plus

395
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,130
again more for Linux foundations

396
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,870
security plus for security overview and

397
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,089
I'm fighting really hard to get ceh

398
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,470
again not because I value that cert as

399
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,149
it is I really I think that they need to

400
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,680
have some offensive security as well

401
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:04,759
we also view a Python program and

402
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,620
disaster recovery business continuity

403
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,500
SQL as forensics bla bla bla this isn't

404
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,660
a pitch for my program what I want to

405
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,269
talk about though is I get so many

406
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,279
people especially when I'm talking to

407
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:18,079
CISOs or you know HR people and I

408
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,350
basically I mean I can read between the

409
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,790
lines you Community College right I will

410
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,370
say and again this is where I do not

411
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:28,550
want to down any of the four-year

412
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,259
institutions but I have I know the

413
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,449
process it takes to build a new class I

414
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:34,329
know the process it takes to build a

415
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:37,880
whole new degree program and it is

416
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:40,609
horrifying like it takes years for me

417
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,949
sometimes to be able to suggest a class

418
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,569
to offer it so let's say for instance at

419
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,949
the awesome internship and I'll talk

420
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:47,420
about this in just a moment experience I

421
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:48,589
learned about PowerShell Empire right

422
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,670
which is like oh dude that's but that's

423
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:51,620
all news from any of you right but I

424
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,660
just learned about it's really cool and

425
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,100
so if I wanted to be able to say okay

426
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,120
based on my understanding there's so

427
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,069
much of living off the land

428
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,420
PowerShell Empire is so powerful well we

429
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:01,219
need to offer a class that really

430
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,689
focuses on how to use PowerShell for

431
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,010
automated tasks and how to defend

432
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,350
against it like that's something I feel

433
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:08,180
like was really important a community

434
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,190
college is much more flexible than a

435
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,750
four-year university so I was able to

436
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,880
approach my Dean and I was able to offer

437
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,310
it this year so that's one of the things

438
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,560
about community colleges especially when

439
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,869
you're teaching technology courses not

440
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,699
just big abstract concepts but like the

441
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,560
nitty gritties of what buttons to flip

442
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:27,319
community colleges are a little better

443
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,689
suited for that so I build my program

444
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:30,979
much more as a vote tech program where

445
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:33,110
the students maybe aren't going to be

446
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,029
CISOs that's fine they're not going to

447
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,800
be the admins they're not even gonna be

448
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:38,060
the threat researchers but these are the

449
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,800
guys who are gonna be sitting in that

450
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,449
sock these are the people who are gonna

451
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,430
be sitting in these in these actual

452
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:44,569
rooms defending your networks and

453
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,280
hopefully they

454
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,570
skill up as they move on right so

455
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,800
they're not just stuck in whatever tech

456
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:53,360
they learned in my program okay

457
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,310
so one of the things too is I learned

458
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,690
very quickly that cybersecurity is kind

459
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,339
of a laughable term in the industry

460
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,770
where as we much prefer information

461
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,900
security InfoSec unfortunately the

462
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,880
public just just digs up cyber cyber

463
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,770
security so I have to code switch all

464
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,660
the time between what I'm talking to

465
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,189
students and when I'm talking to you

466
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,390
know even like you know sometimes we'll

467
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,310
have like our state reps come in I'm

468
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,630
like all about cyber but then if he has

469
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,300
laugh at me when I called cyber so I'm

470
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,550
gonna try and call it InfoSec from now

471
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:22,250
okay and one of the things too about

472
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,500
it's important for you to know that I

473
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,300
have a hard time doubling down on any

474
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,860
particular set of technology like yeah

475
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,260
we do Cisco but networking right that's

476
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,660
pretty general so we train our students

477
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,130
and inch deep and a mile wide and this

478
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,079
is the approach of a lot of cyber

479
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,760
education where you take a survey class

480
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,810
you take a survey of web application

481
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,090
been testing you take a survey of

482
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:43,910
cryptography you take a survey of X Y &

483
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,380
Z which means that your students or new

484
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,360
emerging people coming out of these

485
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,210
colleges are gonna have an approximate

486
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,830
knowledge of many things right but when

487
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,440
they enroll into your actual

488
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,820
organization when you hire them you

489
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,380
might need to do a little bit of that

490
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,210
extra work to then train them and say

491
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,920
okay you know what DNS queries are or

492
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,120
you know what the generals of pentesting

493
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,770
are but now you're gonna be a dedicated

494
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,119
red team right right and we're really

495
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,879
gonna talk to you about what that means

496
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,469
because as a result I can't double down

497
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,300
for the sake of my students on any one

498
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,189
particular piece of technology because

499
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,680
then I'm not exposing them to the range

500
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,290
of the industry right so my job remember

501
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,100
always is to serve my students and to

502
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,709
make sure they have the greatest

503
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:23,419
opportunities as possible so as an

504
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:25,189
industry that's one thing you you need

505
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,260
to be keeping in mind that we are

506
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:30,410
training generalist more often than not

507
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:34,100
than we are ultra specific you know

508
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:36,710
compliance managers so why should you

509
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,290
care about cyber education well first of

510
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,570
all this is where really I have I have a

511
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:44,180
lot of opinions about this certification

512
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:47,000
bodies like CompTIA EC Council and Cisco

513
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:50,450
they dominate the IT and InfoSec

514
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,790
curriculum 100% so when I basically put

515
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,980
that I was teaching to A+ I take all of

516
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,210
the exam objectives and I build lectures

517
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,330
around hitting every single one of those

518
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,649
objectives so if you don't agree like

519
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,779
let's say you're like wow half of this

520
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:05,309
isn't really relevant then we need to

521
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:06,779
know that right because we're getting

522
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,850
sold we're getting pitch we're getting

523
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:10,649
lobbied we get free curriculum fully

524
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,418
built lessons so I was an instructor

525
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:13,918
it's really hard for me to say well I'm

526
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:16,860
not gonna I'm not gonna accept this

527
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,419
resource right especially because I do

528
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,990
see a lot of these certifications on job

529
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:23,370
descriptions right they do appear but

530
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,500
one of the things you have to know is

531
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,449
that this almost exclusively dominates

532
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,980
the IT sector not so much to the

533
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,870
computer science right what's going on

534
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,570
in like the development shops but

535
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,610
specifically the IT focus schools we

536
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,710
want to just slam as many of these certs

537
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,850
on as possible so one of the things that

538
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,080
I need to be able to reach out to

539
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:44,969
industry is I need to say okay does

540
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,799
nobody actually value security Plus like

541
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,990
is that something that like is laughable

542
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,090
at most people and if that's the case we

543
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,370
need to stop teaching that but until we

544
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,678
reach out to industry before we hear the

545
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,029
last on her face we continue to teach it

546
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,960
because that's the direction that we're

547
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:00,029
getting pushed

548
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,010
and I'm not saying when I say we I'm

549
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:03,990
literally saying at a national level

550
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:06,210
that's who's going to these teacher

551
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,500
conferences that's who's sponsoring them

552
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,960
and that's where the majority of

553
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,730
educators are turning so as an industry

554
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,010
you need to be aware of that whether or

555
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:18,690
not you agree with it that's the state

556
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:20,970
of education right now the other thing

557
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,070
too is you do need good people right you

558
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,350
really mean high quality oops sorry

559
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,750
you really need high quality Talent so

560
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,490
if saibra if education institutions are

561
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,140
not teaching the right skills or if

562
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,000
they're not prepping students for the

563
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,590
realities of the field then you end up

564
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,120
with under-qualified and I used that

565
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,740
term miss qualified it's funny because

566
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,658
PowerPoint yells I mean it says that's a

567
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,309
misspelled word but I like that word the

568
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:43,289
reason why I say miss qualified is

569
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:45,270
because let's say that we double down on

570
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:47,789
the Cisco certification and you're like

571
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:49,230
okay Wow all of Portland doesn't use

572
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:50,340
Cisco technology which I don't think is

573
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,350
true I think most people do but let's

574
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,320
just say that was the case right we have

575
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:58,110
miss certified them we have miss

576
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,629
qualified them so I want to be able to

577
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,549
look out nonlin area but even at a

578
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,799
national level and really see what

579
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:07,710
skills do we need to be teaching because

580
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,139
let's be really guys most cybersecurity

581
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,300
and structures at a four-year university

582
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:12,159
they

583
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,389
there came from the science the math or

584
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,160
the computer science background and

585
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,170
trained themselves up in cyber right

586
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,370
that's the evolution that's occurring so

587
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,410
most of the people who are teaching

588
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,540
cybersecurity are either approaching it

589
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,400
from an academic standpoint or like in

590
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,110
my case I just got the master's degree

591
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,970
and started teaching like I have zero

592
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:30,250
professional experience and supposedly

593
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,350
I'm training other professionals right

594
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,180
like that's kind of messed up a little

595
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,439
bit especially in an IT level now I'm

596
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,240
not gonna discredit myself I think I'm a

597
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,860
pretty good teacher but my point being

598
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,380
is that I I need to supplement my

599
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,820
understanding I absolutely need to and

600
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,980
when I look at the majority of my peers

601
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,169
they're all in the same boat as me at

602
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:49,270
least again of the IQ technical level so

603
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,800
you need a high quality Talent

604
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,220
so we need to reach out to industry to

605
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,810
help guide us what we need to teach and

606
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,850
then lastly one of the things as well is

607
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,440
that we saw that giant skills gap we

608
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,929
can't close the skills gap by just

609
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,580
hiring the right people Microsoft

610
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,620
released a study about a year and a half

611
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,600
ago that most girls become interested in

612
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,399
STEM at the age of eleven and a half but

613
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,379
they start to lose interest at fifteen

614
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,660
fifteen is when you can pinpoint and say

615
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:17,170
wow I don't see myself in stem anymore

616
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,940
right so if you're trying to fix the

617
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,040
problem with a new workforce but people

618
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,510
just graduate in college you're missing

619
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,860
where we need to be focusing and

620
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:32,980
doubling down our efforts in

621
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:34,479
cybersecurity education yes right I mean

622
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,770
I can tell you know in my and mine when

623
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,320
I was teaching a cow I was working out

624
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,210
juniors and seniors and I had I mean I I

625
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,830
saw all the same stereotypes existed and

626
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,000
I tried really hard to recruit but I

627
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,780
mean there's only so much you can do at

628
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,100
the end of the road

629
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,550
right like you have to be up touching

630
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:52,149
more and more of those middle spots okay

631
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:54,340
so again state of cyber education pivots

632
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,830
so there's much a national and state

633
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:59,830
cyber education pushes that are really

634
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,659
influencing us one is nice which is a

635
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,800
god I hate the acronyms NIST we all know

636
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,670
NIST right National Institute of

637
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,350
Standards and Technology

638
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,230
they created nice they really like their

639
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,090
acronyms which is the national

640
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,250
initiative for cybersecurity education

641
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,720
they offer tons of frameworks and they

642
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,310
are the big push on grants that are

643
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,520
available to us right now they dominated

644
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:20,470
they broke down all cyber jobs into

645
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,260
these core what do they call them like

646
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,620
domains and then we get money as schools

647
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,350
if we

648
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,790
teach to those domains so again you're

649
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,409
we're letting government dictate what we

650
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:31,420
should be taught right it's not coming

651
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,770
from industry but I do know that many of

652
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,430
people who sit on the nice board are

653
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:38,650
hopefully from industry the NSA they

654
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,360
will certify schools as sinners for

655
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,590
academic excellence which is actually

656
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,510
pretty cool for us because it qualifies

657
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,970
us for grants but we have to do a pretty

658
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,680
rigorous review of our curriculum so

659
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,850
that's cool and if you know that you

660
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,460
know about cyber Oregon it was an

661
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,350
awesome initiative kate brown set signed

662
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,330
Senate bill 90 into law which basically

663
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,919
restructured cybersecurity at the state

664
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,570
level but one of the big things that did

665
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,160
is it opened up money for workforce

666
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,340
development so schools are trying to

667
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,550
pull from state funding to be able to

668
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:08,500
successfully do more cyber initiatives

669
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,030
now this is where and with respect to my

670
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,679
time this is the thing that based on our

671
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,030
keynote how many of you were kind of

672
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,590
pumped after today's keynote I know I

673
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,910
was right and you're probably wondering

674
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,678
like well okay what does that mean how

675
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,059
do I even find someone to mentor like

676
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,360
what do I even do what are my next

677
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:24,070
actionable steps as a result of this I'm

678
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,050
literally going to give you a checklist

679
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,790
of things you can do right like

680
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,980
literally there's a paper I'm gonna give

681
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:32,350
you that you can pick from any of these

682
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:35,550
ten things and you will make measurable

683
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:38,050
actionable differences in your community

684
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,730
the first are internships now we've

685
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,428
heard a lot about what internships mean

686
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,320
but I cannot tell you the amazing

687
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:45,970
benefit that internships have on budding

688
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,559
security professionals because not only

689
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,900
do they see what an actual development

690
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,340
shop looks like but they also know like

691
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,390
do I really need to wear a tie to work

692
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,070
what does it mean to interact with a

693
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,690
boss how do I write this report like

694
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,280
those are things that even returning

695
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,660
adults don't know how to do if they're

696
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,790
shifting from one industry to another

697
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,940
right so internships are incredibly

698
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:05,530
important as was discussed earlier I had

699
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,880
the amazing opportunity to send two of

700
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,860
my students along with myself and a

701
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,350
colleague to silence to go through a

702
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,570
full five-week internship experience

703
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:16,149
where we did controls testing and as an

704
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:18,280
educator I learn an immense amount from

705
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:21,130
this intensive experience with an actual

706
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:23,260
enterprise level company so not only can

707
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,970
you offer internship experiences within

708
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,530
your organization's but you can even

709
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,330
invite other instructors to come in and

710
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,160
learn like like especially during the

711
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,520
summer I will spend portions of my

712
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,350
summer

713
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,040
hanging out learning cyber with you and

714
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:37,449
helping you do your job instantaneously

715
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,950
again like I said we did that

716
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,360
I just wanna be really respect so let

717
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,559
students surprise you a lot of them are

718
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,870
actually really good and they pick up

719
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:45,039
skills really quick I'm gonna pick on

720
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,959
Justin for just a moment one of the

721
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,360
things that he I think really I'm I was

722
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,070
so glad here was he basically just said

723
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,080
hey go learn power channel empire and

724
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,879
three hours later my students on the new

725
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,740
PowerShell Empire right so even though

726
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,600
they didn't know it they were able to

727
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,799
follow guys go to tutorials and they

728
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,820
were able to pick it up and immediately

729
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:03,340
start working at within our environment

730
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:06,158
so let our students surprise you even

731
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,500
young young people who are really pumped

732
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,179
about cyber they will do good work

733
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,889
within your organization and believe me

734
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:14,169
I will not recommend my terrible

735
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:16,600
students to you just know that there are

736
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:18,639
some students who I would not in like a

737
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,949
batch chance in hell send your way I

738
00:25:18,639 --> 00:25:23,110
will only send you the students who I

739
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,460
think are ready for it have the skills

740
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:27,490
set for it and who I think would be

741
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,440
really successful be guest speaker

742
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,419
seriously like a good example I'm

743
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,470
teaching a unit on forensics and even

744
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:33,940
they'll have that damn shirt I still

745
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,250
don't know what forensics means right so

746
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,049
one of the things that I want to be able

747
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,130
to do is pull a hex editor and dig into

748
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:41,769
like I don't know some students like

749
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:44,230
stenography right so I can follow these

750
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:45,370
these old tutorials or I could literally

751
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,990
say hey you want to swing by the mouth

752
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,418
of campus for an hour to and show my

753
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,250
students how a hex editor works sweet do

754
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:52,570
I'll buy you lunch right seriously

755
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,070
that's the kind of thing where when we

756
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,840
say guest speaker we don't need a

757
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,370
formalized talk you can literally just

758
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,500
come in and sub me out for a topic I

759
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,989
don't know super well because my day is

760
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,700
access databasing cyber fundamentals a

761
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,320
plus and then I'm teaching ethical

762
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,330
hacking class like my day is so

763
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,428
fragmented on the skills I need to know

764
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:12,699
that I sometimes just need a pro to come

765
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:14,230
in and help me out we have just as well

766
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,539
Jen Jen cyber there's an amazing

767
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:19,149
opportunity for serving our k-12

768
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:21,070
students the Northwest cyber camp is an

769
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:22,330
awesome camp that is also run during the

770
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,639
summer it features CyberPatriot

771
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,199
curriculum but it also has guest

772
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:28,840
speakers everyday so you can come in and

773
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,669
give it like an hour talk like I said I

774
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,039
make guesses about what should be taught

775
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:34,809
like I'm a pro at Penn testing okay cool

776
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,100
I have a web development background but

777
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:37,629
I have no idea what should be taught

778
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,039
when it comes to databasing like should

779
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,659
I still be teaching SQL should I be

780
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,519
doing a survey of no SQL things like

781
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:44,320
that so sometimes I just want to pick

782
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:46,269
your brain and if let's say you're in

783
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,070
database security it's really helpful

784
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:48,940
for me to say hey what are you working

785
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,780
with

786
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,030
the things that you're seeing an

787
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:54,220
industry trend and even that informal

788
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:56,080
conversation can really dramatically

789
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:59,070
help shape my curriculum and then as a

790
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,110
result positively impact my students and

791
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,580
again another opportunity let's say that

792
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,439
I'm teaching forensics and you have a

793
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,210
really great on alone again that's of

794
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,740
course depending on NDA's and everything

795
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,180
let's you have a really great snippet of

796
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,830
network traffic that is totally fine

797
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,090
there's no sensitive data in it that you

798
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,100
think would be really interesting for me

799
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,570
to show my students I'll take that pcap

800
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,520
load it in Wireshark and show off this

801
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,689
really cool anomaly that shows up that's

802
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,940
the kind of thing that might take me

803
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,230
literally hours to build that lab that's

804
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,210
something that you spun up in like two

805
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,680
seconds right so if you think about

806
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,050
something really cool that's going on

807
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,970
something that is really citing some new

808
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:33,490
idea some problem that you just solved

809
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:35,290
share that with local info sections

810
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,360
teachers and that can't get turned into

811
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,770
an entire lesson that would be really

812
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,139
beneficial and again it's something that

813
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:43,030
would save me hours of time for a really

814
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,550
positive and meaningful impact for our

815
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,600
students in addition one of the things

816
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,470
that in order for me to get funding from

817
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,850
the state I have to have something

818
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,440
called Advisory Committee where I have a

819
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,600
group of people who are supposedly

820
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,610
industry experts who help guide our

821
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,080
program a lot of these people again

822
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,300
their programming folks they're not

823
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,070
actually cyber folks so if you want to

824
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,020
actually help come in and help serve one

825
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:03,730
your local community colleges or help

826
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,770
serve one of your local universities a

827
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,080
lot of them all need an advisory council

828
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,520
and let's say I have ten maybe five

829
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,409
actually show up to the meetings right

830
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,570
because of also scheduling conflicts so

831
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,670
we like big rosters of advisory

832
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,080
committees so that when and we actually

833
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,640
have a meeting of ten or fifteen people

834
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,080
show up we have really great

835
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,090
conversations about what we should be

836
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,129
teaching from a multidisciplinary field

837
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:26,679
and right now my advisory committee is

838
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:28,570
all CISOs to the security folks we have

839
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,770
which isn't bad but when I'm saying hey

840
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,240
should we learn PowerShell they're like

841
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,440
well let's talk about the soft skills

842
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,580
I'm like okay but do they actually need

843
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,670
to know PowerShell because they don't

844
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,899
know the answer that another thing too

845
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,400
there's tons of awesome cyber

846
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,600
competitions that we would love to have

847
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,040
any comment and coach some of our

848
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,830
students helps we can help to spin up a

849
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,389
club we have like ASB money for that so

850
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,710
if you want to come in and help really

851
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,020
dig in a blue teaming a red teaming you

852
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,930
can help coach a team and again just

853
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,670
share stuff that's really cool I am

854
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,170
seriously this isn't a plug but I know

855
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:58,600
that there's a junk faculty positions

856
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:01,110
open right now at PSU I'm serious you

857
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,330
guys teach a class it's great side money

858
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:05,219
and most of the time you can just focus

859
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,899
on an area that you need like Mount Hood

860
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,920
for instance we're offering two database

861
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,140
classes like an advanced database

862
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,840
courses none of us know anything about

863
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,130
databases so we're looking for adjunct

864
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,780
faculty who are just really pros at

865
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,210
databasing right you could probably make

866
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:19,620
about $1,500 about Hood per month

867
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,600
just by doing adjunct in one or two

868
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,949
classes so if you will are maybe a

869
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,719
contractor or you're looking to have a

870
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:28,140
more flexible kind of schedule this is a

871
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,430
really amazing opportunity for you many

872
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,900
of the students I'm gonna wrap up my

873
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,730
speakers I know one I'm running out of

874
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,440
time many of my students walk into a

875
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,060
degree program to skill up and build a

876
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,000
better future for themselves we need

877
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,960

my experience and my students experience

887
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,939
is that all the students in our local

888
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,790
community could be so enriched by

889
