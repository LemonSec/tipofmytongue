1
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,400
I've actually had the pleasure of

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,369
working with Nisha Kumar our first

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,490
speaker today I also had the pleasure of

4
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:27,080
actually wearing the prototype of what

5
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:31,339
she's going to talk about today at

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,440
DEFCON 25 so and I had the only one and

7
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,120
that's why this came out and I'm really

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,390
pleased that she's here to talk about it

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,860
today

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:43,220
so anyway Nisha Kumar it has is the

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:46,970
badge designer for the DC 503 badge that

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,290
they used at DEFCON 26 this year all of

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:53,690
this stuff is available out on our

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:56,420
github it's the PDX Badgers github PDX

15
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:59,780
Badgers 2018 bangla she also maintains

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:03,170
an open source project turn which is

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:06,020
working with docker containers with

18
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:08,390
docker containers on finding out what

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:16,060
you've actually got in it and so anyway

20
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:20,270
without further ado Nisha Kumar okay

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:25,010
okay I do not know how to operate Google

22
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,548
Sites obviously there's a triangle

23
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,320
button

24
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:35,810
oh yeah present okay and right there

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:38,630
sweet okay hi so this talk is about the

26
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:43,010
making of the bangle it I have one on my

27
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,750
hand which I will try to demo and while

28
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,570
I'm trying to demo I'm going to talk

29
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,280
about all the wonderful people that

30
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,139
actually worked with me on this so

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,880
there's route killer John Han and secure

32
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:58,220
leaflets and odj and peers all of this

33
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,000
stuff that I'm talking about the code

34
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,310
the docs

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
all the Gerber files everything is on

36
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:08,149
this github special thanks to the dog

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,579
crate who got me involved in all of this

38
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:13,970
in the first place and the family who

39
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:18,790
were ready supportive while I was doing

40
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:23,540
this quick question how many are under

41
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:26,359
21 nobody under 21 good I don't have to

42
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:29,250
have a filter then

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,120
all right so a little background about

44
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:37,110
this

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:40,110
so back for Def Con 25 which is 2017 DC

46
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,030
503 made this lovely wagon badge how

47
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,010
many of you are familiar with the wagon

48
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,910
badge yeah

49
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:50,609
it was awesome it had this regard owed

50
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,549
BMD 300 module that was Bluetooth

51
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,940
enabled this badge did not use any of

52
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:01,940
the Bluetooth features but it also came

53
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:06,270
with this 64 megahertz ARM Cortex with

54
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,579
the giant amount of flash memory and RAM

55
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:13,320
so you could run a little video game on

56
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:15,330
it and that was pretty cool but there

57
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,329
was no Bluetooth and that was something

58
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:22,620
that the DC 503 folks wanted to include

59
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:24,150
this time around in 2018 meanwhile in my

60
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,440
corner

61
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:31,260
there was Mickey asked me to make her

62
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,930
bangle that had blinky lights on it and

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,470
this was a weekend project that I built

64
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,840
really quickly I had the I knew what to

65
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,570
use but I had no idea whether I could do

66
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,630
it or not and so I just tried over the

67
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:50,480
weekend to do it so this is what it

68
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:54,210
looks like she took it to DEFCON and

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,649
everybody wanted one apparently I do not

70
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,020
I do not know because I didn't go to

71
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,740
DEFCON this is what I heard

72
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:06,420
this is third-person the feedback that I

73
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:08,160
got but that was when later it turned

74
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,630
out to be right because dc5 wordplay

75
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,370
approached me and asked me if i wanted

76
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:18,630
to make one that had basically a bangle

77
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:21,149
and all of the but the BMD 300 so

78
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,690
Bluetooth enabled bangle which I will

79
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:27,179
try to demo for you right now so here's

80
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:31,170
my phone here's the bangle in passive

81
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:34,140
mode it just has blinky lights well it

82
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:37,150
just has like static lights it doesn't

83
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:42,159
blink and through the

84
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:45,520
app on the phone I can connect to it if

85
00:04:42,160 --> 00:05:03,760
I could find it because there are so

86
00:04:45,520 --> 00:05:10,599
many I should have connected to so they

87
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:14,169
think this is Hoyt well anyway here it

88
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:18,070
is it blinks it's got a pattern there

89
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:20,889
there's proof people have seen it and I

90
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:24,340
will this is unfortunate

91
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:26,290
ya know well and it's also like

92
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:31,090
rebooting a number of times so it's

93
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:34,300
obviously not foolproof but there's lots

94
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:38,500
of the things that it has is that it's

95
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,020
got in passive mode it just detects any

96
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,400
nearby Bluetooth devices and based on

97
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,250
their MAC addresses it will glow a

98
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,120
certain color and that's what it is in

99
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:51,820
right now then based on the number of

100
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,970
Bluetooth devices it sees you can unlock

101
00:05:51,820 --> 00:06:00,190
special pattern like blinky light

102
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:03,340
patterns with it so as far as the design

103
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:06,610
is concerned this is inspired by a de

104
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:10,299
fruits LED bracelet there's a link to it

105
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:13,240
they have all of their files for this

106
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:16,720
available on their github as well they

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:21,870
have a tutorial on how to make their bad

108
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:24,760
about their bracelet and it uses the

109
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:29,979
Adafruit trinket which is like a tiny a

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:33,460
teeny eighty tiny 85 based dev board so

111
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:37,900
their their bracelet basically has a

112
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:41,320
slot for the trinket to go into now over

113
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,870
here the dev board that we base this

114
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,419
upon was the Adafruit feather which is

115
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:48,550
much bigger than the trinket so we had

116
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:49,680
to place the board horizontally rather

117
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,750
than vertically

118
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,050
and so there's a lip and there's a slot

119
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:58,860
over there for the board to sit in there

120
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:03,390
is also a slot for the LED strip to go

121
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:07,320
around and the LED strip actually is

122
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:09,240
soldered on top of the board so even

123
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,280
even though the board is placed on the

124
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,770
slot there's an LED strip going around

125
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:20,429
it so on the outside you see like it's a

126
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:25,169
one continuous strip so then there's

127
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:28,620
also like a neodymium magnet thing which

128
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:33,230
snaps on really satis it's got a really

129
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:38,160
satisfying snap like a normal bracelet

130
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:41,460
john hanis made this thank you John

131
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,919
the board design is mostly borrowed from

132
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,750
Adafruit feather board which is also

133
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,409
available on github if you want to check

134
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:53,880
that out this board layout is also

135
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:56,550
available on github on the on the link

136
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,350
that I showed earlier I'll put that out

137
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,580
if you want

138
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:06,120
so the SOC for the Adafruit board we

139
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:11,310
replaced that with the BMD 300 and the

140
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:14,220
we shrunk the board down by basically

141
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:17,490
removing a bunch of components from the

142
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:21,030
Adafruit the original feather board we

143
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:24,690
only routed out one data line we didn't

144
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:27,780
have any reset switch or any on-and-off

145
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:31,830
switch the Adafruit feather also has

146
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:34,338
like a DF few ons on switch which is

147
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:39,569
like a factory reset we didn't have that

148
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:41,780
and this board was designed by me that's

149
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:46,440
my github and root killer who helped me

150
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:48,839
the board programming uses a Adafruit

151
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,030
s-- bootloader which we burn which we

152
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:58,920
weren't using the regard of board as a

153
00:08:53,030 --> 00:09:00,420
what a jst programmer and so nordic has

154
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,870
a way of this

155
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,060
based on the NRA 52 832 Nordic SOC and

156
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,370
they have a way of making a bootloader

157
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,609
but we just use data fruits cuz we were

158
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:15,240
we didn't really have much time and we

159
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:18,149
programmed with Arduino I know Oh DJ

160
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,430
said that he's an electrical engineer

161
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:25,260
I'm an electrical engineer too so I

162
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:29,699
cheated here so all the programming was

163
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:32,189
done by Dean Pierce okay and the board

164
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:34,729
programming this is actually one of the

165
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:39,990
cool things about this board is that

166
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:43,440
Nordic has UART ble service so you can

167
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:46,440
it it converts the service allows you to

168
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,380
talk to the D to the device so you can

169
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,589
actually use one of the you can either

170
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,649
use a de fruits blue bluefruit le app in

171
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:57,690
UART mode or you can use one of those

172
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:01,529
serial Bluetooth terminal apps they're

173
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:05,490
available both in Android and in iOS and

174
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:09,120
you can use any one of them to send data

175
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:12,600
to the device so we had made it such

176
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,470
that if you parse the data and you see

177
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:20,370
any of these key words it'll tell you

178
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,890
what to do so yeah the the bangle

179
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,540
actually has a shell which is I think

180
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:31,439
this is one of the coolest parts about

181
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:33,569
this so yeah it just scans scans any in

182
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,019
passive mode it just scans devices and

183
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:39,180
reads the data from the rx buffer and

184
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:41,100
figures out you know based on the MAC

185
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:47,370
address what color it should blink the

186
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:49,920
lights and this the fact that it has all

187
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:53,970
of these different things like the

188
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:57,180
Nordic Development Board is really

189
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:59,160
powerful actually so you could you could

190
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,859
operate the device in either central

191
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,839
mode where it just scans for nearby

192
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,000
devices or you can operate it in

193
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,760
peripheral mode where you can talk to it

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,310
from a central like your phone or you

195
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,439
can operate it in dual mode which makes

196
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,689
it behave like

197
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,300
oh the central and the peripheral so you

198
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:20,420
can make it do all kinds of like mesh

199
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,790
networking stuff there's actually like a

200
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,550
GATT service for mesh networks that I

201
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:28,670
haven't read about so programming wise

202
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:31,790
the possibilities are just amazing for

203
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,620
this one and you know we can they're all

204
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,329
the code is out there so if you want you

205
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,370
can hack it and see if you can make it

206
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,700
work because within the time we had I

207
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:48,010
like couldn't figure it out myself okay

208
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:51,050
now for all of the gotchas so the design

209
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:53,420
because we were probe we were designing

210
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,849
the bangle and the board at the same

211
00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:00,920
time I really didn't know the exact

212
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:04,550
dimensions of the board beef before the

213
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:08,560
bangle was designed so we needed to

214
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:11,839
secure the board to the bangle with a

215
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,040
with heat shrink so we use clear heat

216
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:18,620
shrink there this made assembly horrible

217
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:23,180
we spent lots of time just trying to

218
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:25,460
stretch the pain over the board and we

219
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,189
had to also secure the battery that way

220
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,810
this didn't turn out we didn't plan it

221
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,280
this way this is just like how

222
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:35,349
everything turned out and this is

223
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:39,949
basically hacking to make it sit there

224
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:42,260
so another thing is that we only had one

225
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,810
size we were hoping to have many sizes

226
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:48,020
for like vigorous as well as small

227
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:50,449
wrists I have a tiny wrist and this is

228
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,430
the only one which was tiny and the

229
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,640
reason I could make it work was because

230
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:57,800
I dremeled out a slot for the board to

231
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,710
sit in so basically when the whole

232
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,959
design was shrunk the board slot was

233
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:06,020
also shrunk and so the board couldn't

234
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,750
fit in it there was a lot of Dremel in

235
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:12,220
happening as you can see we also had to

236
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:15,890
Dremel and carve out slots for the the

237
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:20,240
program the USB slot as well as the

238
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:22,670
battery slot so along with the original

239
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,980
design there was a lot of hacking going

240
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,680
on but at least that now

241
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:33,410
we got a good idea of what to consider

242
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:36,649
when we're designing this board as you

243
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:38,660
can see this is how this is how we made

244
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,170
the this actually turned out very well

245
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:44,600
like I thought that we did pretty a good

246
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,880
amount of forethought to think about

247
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,579
where the pads ought to be on the board

248
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:54,889
in order for the strip to be soldered

249
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:56,719
onto it as far as the line mint is

250
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:59,000
concerned there was a lot of arguing

251
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,639
going back and forth with regards to

252
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,029
this but I thought it turned out very

253
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,709
well one thing I didn't consider when I

254
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:11,329
was designing the board was that the

255
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:14,209
strip the strip thickness so it actually

256
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:17,180
sits a little slanted on the board

257
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:21,500
because the board was not wide enough to

258
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:25,849
accommodate it these things

259
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:29,060
there were many devices on the original

260
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:31,760
feather board that were specific to

261
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:35,420
Adafruit so you could only source those

262
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,550
spots through them and I mean I

263
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:42,019
understand why they do this they they

264
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:44,689
need to make money but we had to find

265
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:47,990
alternatives for that the USB

266
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:50,899
alternative was reasonably easy fine but

267
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:53,089
the jst one was really hard because we

268
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:56,060
also had to consider what batteries we

269
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:58,339
had on hand so these are these lipo

270
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,699
batteries are used to

271
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:06,769
they're used in drone design like drone

272
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:09,290
hacking so that was the kind of

273
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:11,990
connector that we had to work with and

274
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,510
so we had to find a compatible connector

275
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,449
and we also had to consider whether it

276
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:20,180
was housed or not and depending upon

277
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:23,510
whether there's housing or not we can

278
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:26,989
make the connector fit so they were very

279
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:30,050
I spent a I spent a lot of hours looking

280
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:33,949
for the right connector for this so

281
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:37,670
these these are actually available on de

282
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:40,910
jakke so this

283
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:43,219
out in the end oh there's something over

284
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:46,610
there that says I am a noob this is

285
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:50,540
actually my first board design I had

286
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:53,720
never done this before so in that itself

287
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:57,140
was like I I was I was terrified

288
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,230
so when I started off I actually didn't

289
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,270
do anything until your root killer told

290
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:07,340
me did you do anything you got to work

291
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:10,430
on this so there was some there was some

292
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:15,350
hesitation from my part but and I'm so

293
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:17,180
glad that it worked really like relief

294
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,220
that it actually worked otherwise it

295
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,550
would have been like you're never doing

296
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,550
this again

297
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:29,500
yeah so these are things that we or I

298
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:34,280
did not consider when we were doing this

299
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:37,160
it was well for one thing the planning

300
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:40,880
to put all this together was just

301
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:45,319
enormous I had no idea there I mean you

302
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:48,650
had to think about assembly timelines

303
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:53,590
and and this is not just board assembly

304
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:56,810
this is like board fabbing this is born

305
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:59,120
putting the parts on the board soldering

306
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:02,660
stuff onto the board putting the board

307
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:06,170
in the bangle I felt like if we spent

308
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:08,659
more time thinking about how much time

309
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:13,760
it would take to assemble this it would

310
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:16,790
have gone much faster we I don't think I

311
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,420
think we did consider whether the bangle

312
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:22,639
is going to be easily assembled but not

313
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,280
to the extent where we're thinking we're

314
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,980
trying to shave of seconds in the

315
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,170
assembly we were just like oh it takes

316
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,260
us two it takes us a minute to do this

317
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:38,420
it's not gonna be that bad well you know

318
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:41,210
two or three minutes multiplied by one

319
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,930
hundred and sixteen hundred and twenty I

320
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:48,100
don't remember one hundred and sixty

321
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:50,810
that's a that's a long time to assemble

322
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,379
there was also like 3d printing dates

323
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:55,730
along

324
00:17:51,380 --> 00:18:00,500
the bangle was 3d printed they were 3d

325
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:03,080
printed up to day of event by people in

326
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,970
the community like people actually said

327
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,090
I have a 3d printer and I can print

328
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:12,110
these things for you and I don't think

329
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:14,330
we would have gotten all of the bangles

330
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:18,320
printed if it weren't for people helping

331
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:23,629
out like that so this took a lot of

332
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:28,039
people hours okay and people tell me

333
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:29,929
that this was received well but so take

334
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,700
this with a grain of salt i assault I

335
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:40,039
didn't go to Def Con so I don't really

336
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:45,470
know yeah no that's secondhand I don't

337
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:48,679
know I will I will be the judge of there

338
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,600
I guess some of it happened like some of

339
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,919
the feedback I was getting was from the

340
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:57,439
one hackaday article about all of the

341
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:01,460
DEF CON badges and they barely had

342
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,860
anything about this so it was probably

343
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,350
because I wasn't there to explain like

344
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:10,428
you know this is all the cool stuff that

345
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:12,559
it can do how they saw was this tab

346
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:15,110
angle with like blinky lights and some

347
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,649
diffuse stuff and everyone would and

348
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:21,408
lots of people had them so I'm wondering

349
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:24,110
you know just looking at all of the

350
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:27,380
other badges that are out there maybe

351
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:30,320
this wasn't that flashy a badge first of

352
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,330
all it wasn't even a badge so it's kind

353
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,760
of like one of those things DC 5 or 3

354
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,399
took a gambit on like they took a risk

355
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:42,620
saying well it's not a badge but you

356
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:45,200
know it'll be cool but it wasn't garish

357
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:48,649
and I wasn't really looking for anything

358
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:54,890
garish but maybe it ought to be garish

359
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:59,030
I'm not sure they're I mean so I I'm

360
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:01,850
still looking for feedback on that maybe

361
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,379
it maybe it ought to be subtle I don't

362
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,899
know

363
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:12,940
DEFCON badges doesn't they don't seem to

364
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:15,630
have subtlety built-in so I wasn't maybe

365
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:20,050
this was just like a mismatch of vision

366
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:24,790
but the fact that it actually worked

367
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:30,669
was something just amazing to me we

368
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:33,100
there wasn't much as far as expertise

369
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,800
was concerned this looked like something

370
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,629
that required expertise and we didn't

371
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:41,770
have that much of expertise and we guard

372
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:44,590
ourselves up to speed on it you know big

373
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,600
shout out to control age that had all of

374
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,120
the equipment it was in state-of-the-art

375
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:53,860
equipment but we were still able to use

376
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:57,310
it to make something like this so it's I

377
00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:01,000
am just very thrilled that this worked

378
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:04,270
out the way that it did and my hats off

379
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,940
to everyone at DC 503 and control H to

380
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:10,379
be able to help me pull this off so with

381
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,380
that I'm saying thank you

382
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:20,600
and I don't know do we have time for Q&A

383
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:30,799
five minutes for Q&A okay does anyone

384
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:35,750
have any questions yes sir we thought

385
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:37,519
that we would but we actually didn't we

386
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:42,139
thought about it and we were like oh

387
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:44,840
crap maybe we you know but no we didn't

388
00:21:42,139 --> 00:22:04,010
have any interference so yeah no that's

389
00:21:44,840 --> 00:22:06,949
a good question okay so I am in the

390
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:12,260
process of thinking about it one of the

391
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:14,840
ideas I had was maybe make beads use the

392
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:17,600
mesh thing and make like individual

393
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,519
beads that when they when you string

394
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,539
them together will produce different

395
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:26,929
effects so I'm kind of thinking in the

396
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:29,120
way of like mesh networks but I do not

397
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,159
have I do not have enough knowledge of

398
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:36,408
how the platform works in order to pull

399
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:43,370
that off I am also helping with the

400
00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:45,799
Diana initiative and that's I am that's

401
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:49,129
gonna be like a very simple earrings

402
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:51,168
kind of thing but not with this that

403
00:22:49,130 --> 00:23:02,769
that'll be like more my style which is

404
00:22:51,169 --> 00:23:02,769
like subtle thank you yes sir

405
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,670
well so I mean there are several ways we

406
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,370
could have gone about this

407
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:29,090
I suppose the fastest way we could have

408
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:32,270
done that is make a mold you know and

409
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:36,590
then outsource it to some kind of mold

410
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:38,840
producing thing but really what what the

411
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,929
3d printer allowed us to do is to be

412
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,330
more flexible like I said I was

413
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:47,180
designing the board while the bangle was

414
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,960
being designed and we were actually able

415
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:55,190
to make some changes with the bangle

416
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:57,650
based on how the board was changing but

417
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,810
I think that that's a good point like

418
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:02,870
you know if we had a prototype all set

419
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:05,530
and we say okay this is and this is how

420
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:09,350
it's going to be then we could probably

421
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:14,060
find a supplier who would produce a mold

422
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:18,740
for us that would require long like we

423
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:21,409
we did this in three months so that

424
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:26,780
might involve you know more six months

425
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:29,000
period so yeah there was also like some

426
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,100
consideration of making fly using Flex

427
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,860
PCBs but again we do not have any

428
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,510
expertise on making Flex PCBs so I don't

429
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,740
know how that would that would have

430
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:42,590
worked out but yeah

431
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:49,640
mass production was not something that I

432
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:52,000
was considering thank you for the

433
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,000
question

434
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,719
[Music]

435
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,429
I think we worked with whatever we had

436
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:22,178
yeah the the black one I actually use

437
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:23,799
super glue to stick the the strip on top

438
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:27,909
of the black one

439
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:33,450
we thought about clear PLA s the before

440
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:33,450
but I don't think we had any on hand oh

441
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:45,119
yeah you have one okay I think thank you

442
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,720
[Applause]

443
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,929
you
