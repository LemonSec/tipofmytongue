1
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,759
thank you thank you very thank you very

2
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,070
much for coming out like she said I work

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,390
at Mozilla we like open source stuff and

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,980
we're here to talk about open source and

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,840
specifically open source security

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:30,160
solutions and how they play in an

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,570
enterprise role so the agenda here

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,100
basically we're talking about you've

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,899
only got so much money for things like

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,390
blinky boxes consults and stuff like

11
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:38,680
that so seem like open source could help

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,039
here right so what's working what's

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,780
holding people back and mostly what this

14
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,090
is a precursor for as mozo is working on

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,890
a set of initiatives to help kind of

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,170
curate a set of open source solutions to

17
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,789
common security problems and so these

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:57,909
are some of the items that we hit on in

19
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:59,739
this talk so we have some problems

20
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:02,170
things like money we're gonna talk about

21
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:03,640
where commercial stuff may win we're

22
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,770
talking about open source there are some

23
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,300
places or open source clearly is winning

24
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,449
they were also talking about problems

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,950
with open source potential solutions I'm

26
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,270
gonna hit on five projects you may not

27
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,190
know about that probably could help you

28
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,509
maybe today maybe tomorrow when you get

29
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,340
back in the office or Monday when you

30
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,590
get back in the office then last we're

31
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,330
gonna wrap up with with how you can how

32
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,410
you can help

33
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,090
first I have to talk about how this is

34
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,979
not a talk about browsers yes I work at

35
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,690
a company that makes browsers this is a

36
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,250
presentation being made from a browser

37
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,390
and they're great but this is not to

38
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:36,430
talk about browsers we're going to talk

39
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:39,130
about everything except browsers so this

40
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,590
summer I got a new boss this is a

41
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,899
picture of my boss this is not a picture

42
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,400
of my boss but he asked me what Mozilla

43
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,050
could do to help solve the world's

44
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,920
security problems he's a kind of a big

45
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:53,170
big thinker using open-source Mozilla

46
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,360
loves open source so this is Mozilla

47
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,550
github repo you can see the frightening

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,500
numbers that we have there the 1900s

49
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,390
something repositories have been roughly

50
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,700
a thousand people some of whom work and

51
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,430
was a listen don't foreign or something

52
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,570
team so we do open source by default

53
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,069
matter of fact our default data

54
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,049
classification in Mozilla is public

55
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,819
because everything you create is public

56
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,379
stuff so that's great we like open

57
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:17,890
source but how can we help here exactly

58
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:19,450
right so my boss and I agreed to use the

59
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,730
remaining bits of 2018 to do some

60
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,399
experiments bring some science to this

61
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,959
work and do some focus work in 2019 to

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,450
help kind of curates open source to

63
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,090
crazy solutions so thanks your your open

64
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,549
me keep my boss happy and helping me

65
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,170
keep on track for 2019 and also help to

66
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,060
kind of figure out exactly what curate

67
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,640
really means this is nice it sounds like

68
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,319
a nice word nice little definition but

69
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,518
what does it really mean to do this kind

70
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,010
of work and more importantly what does

71
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:49,810
open-source need in order to be to be

72
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:56,980
successful so we all have budgets to

73
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:58,930
operate and I'm curious of things not

74
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,220
working at all so I'm curious how many

75
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,590
people would say that they've got

76
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,810
essentially $0 like they have no impact

77
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,269
on their budget it's just like money

78
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,799
that happens somehow and then they're

79
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:10,000
stuck with it's like nothing nothing

80
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:11,739
there's a couple people raise their

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,060
hands in there so I'm curious how many

82
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,849
people would say in the middle of this

83
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,709
they got like enough money they have

84
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:20,290
everything they need they're happy and

85
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,730
satisfied okay nice smattering and then

86
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,959
any of the spectrum there how many

87
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,790
people say they have too much money I

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,530
wish I could give my money to somebody

89
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,390
else and I wouldn't have to worry about

90
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,799
spending it at the end of the year it

91
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,420
comes up I gotta go find new ways to

92
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,370
spend money I have to invent things

93
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,369
don't even exist problems that aren't

94
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,090
the real question here is that open

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,620
source is the end-all be-all how come

96
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,120
everyone isn't using it and saving all

97
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,069
the money that they would spend on

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,230
blinky boxes and vendors and consultants

99
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:51,700
and go do something more fun like take

100
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:53,590
exotic vacations things like that there

101
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,179
are some clear police clear spaces

102
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,090
though when you look at kind of the

103
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,410
inventory of open source stuff where

104
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,519
there seems to be very little open

105
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,620
source coverage and so therefore

106
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,060
commercial stuff clearly wins so things

107
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,639
like database security there are some

108
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,109
packages that kind of help with database

109
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,389
security but nothing's as complete as

110
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:11,950
the commercial stuff that's out there

111
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,660
email security especially not spam

112
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,638
assassin sort of stuff I mean it wins

113
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,829
there is but it's become vendor packaged

114
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,650
but things like DCAM stuff like that

115
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,539
there's nothing really that kind of can

116
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,010
take that space and email and then

117
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:27,190
there's probably a debate about the AV

118
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,800
antivirus space we'll get into some

119
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:32,139
survey results that talk about that

120
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,639
specifically so if we're gonna talk

121
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,260
about problems with open source we first

122
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,000
need to understand or if we're going to

123
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,349
talk about solving problems with open

124
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,580
source we first need to understand the

125
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:40,688
problems with

126
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,878
open-source it's a symbiotic

127
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:44,349
relationship so when the easiest ways to

128
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,569
find out what folks are struggling with

129
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:48,759
was to ask them we've got this program

130
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:50,860
at Mozilla that I was lucky enough to be

131
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,259
able to help kind of kick off we call it

132
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,909
a culture of experimentation somebody

133
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,229
said once I'm gonna mess up the quote

134
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:58,659
but if you're not doing controlled

135
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,370
experiments on a subset of your users

136
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:02,409
you are by definition doing an

137
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,389
uncontrolled experiment on the entirety

138
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:06,099
of your user base and so the culture of

139
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:07,719
experiments is all about shifting the

140
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:10,180
needle of that so you're doing small

141
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:12,550
things you can fail quickly you can get

142
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,750
some insights then you can do larger

143
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,340
versions of those things and hopefully

144
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,330
not upset your entire user base all at

145
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,310
once just because you thought something

146
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,039
was a great idea so one of the things

147
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,690
that came out of that is a survey

148
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:23,860
surveys are cheap and they are a great

149
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,629
way to get data if you have no idea

150
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,830
where to start just ask people because

151
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:29,050
they'll tell you they've got lots of

152
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,370
information especially in this space the

153
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,840
open source people beat their head

154
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,539
against problems for a long time and

155
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,758
they wish someone asked them so we did a

156
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:38,650
survey looking for like what's in news

157
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,360
but it's not it's sort of barriers and

158
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,750
stuff we're out there this is just a

159
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,039
smattering of this and so the first

160
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,990
thing that we found out is the open

161
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,150
source definitely is in play I was

162
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,150
expecting these numbers to be way way

163
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,039
way more skewed than they are in this

164
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,109
slide it's pretty much 50/50 we went

165
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:57,878
back and forth depending on the kind of

166
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,620
the communities that I that I queried in

167
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:02,289
there so I sent this out mostly just to

168
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,360
kind of my social circles like so

169
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:06,759
mailing lists slack channels Twitter

170
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,460
that kind of stuff so very scientific

171
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,379
right but it was interesting I think we

172
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,299
got some good information so the curious

173
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:15,190
part of this is that it wasn't just open

174
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,529
source right do you use nmap I think

175
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,719
probably everybody is I used n accounts

176
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:21,729
as an open source but this the question

177
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:23,560
was more about do use open source as a

178
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:25,240
significant part of your information

179
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,919
security program meaning you are relying

180
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,719
on open source to give you some

181
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,818
capability and you made a purposeful

182
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:33,190
decision to not choose a commercial

183
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:36,909
vendor product as a result like you said

184
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:39,069
it's kind of a 50/50 sort of split so

185
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:40,569
there are some some definitely some some

186
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,000
winners or some things that are used and

187
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:44,050
useful in open source and so how that

188
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,139
kind of breaks out

189
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,729
you've got your your IDs categories so

190
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,380
bro which by the way has changed its

191
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:51,359
name to Zeke so if you've been saying

192
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,439
bro you don't have to learn

193
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,650
instead like Zika you shall find snore

194
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,169
so the ideas of the world especially

195
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,179
we're well represented in that in that

196
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:04,740
list of folks who do use open source

197
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,270
stuff and then there's kind of the

198
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,030
loggia scenario right how do you get

199
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,409
logs from one place to another syslog

200
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,609
actually was never mentioned even though

201
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:13,219
it's open source and it's probably the

202
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,050
place all this stuff that comes from

203
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:17,490
syslog syslog-ng our syslog those kind

204
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,900
of things but the things that kind of

205
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:24,000
grab that and make it into something

206
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:25,799
like oak log shipper got mentioned in

207
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,599
there so log categories is another one

208
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,449
that people definitely make use of open

209
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,219
source which makes sense and then end

210
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,539
point stuff started to show up which was

211
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:36,029
interesting that's kind of where they

212
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:38,250
yeah the antivirus question comes into

213
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:39,689
play so his query was mentioned a lot

214
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,879
there's a thing that people use Gore

215
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:43,430
came up surprising I hadn't really heard

216
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,830
of many people with a successful

217
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,150
implementation but it did come up and

218
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,688
then there were some mentions in there

219
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,938
also of clamavi specifically as a virus

220
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:56,219
implementation and then there was a

221
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,449
there was some mention of sub can I got

222
00:07:56,219 --> 00:08:00,449
lumped together and like the scanner or

223
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:02,460
sort of category right so Nick doe in

224
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,770
Maps app just like a kind of one-off

225
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,089
sort of scanner sort of thing so it's

226
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,479
interesting because you've got you've

227
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:11,400
got everything down from like a kind of

228
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,500
thing you'd have to implement and know

229
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,779
this can be up 99% of the time like a

230
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,430
bro or an idea sort of system to a

231
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,440
one-off thing I'm just gonna a map scam

232
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,150
something so you can say open source is

233
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,300
being successful in all the various

234
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,560
categories so one of the really

235
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,060
interesting things as sergeant asked

236
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,560
people what their challenges are so this

237
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,169
was the the question right so what do

238
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,849
you think the greatest barriers are felt

239
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:35,370
by enterprises and considering using

240
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,529
open source scenarios and there and so

241
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,380
this is the way the the questions went

242
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,958
out there and the results were super

243
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,640
interesting so we've got everything from

244
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,859
fortune ality gaps to don't know what

245
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,350
what kind of things exist out there not

246
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,670
surprisingly lack of support was one of

247
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,290
the the top things and there one of the

248
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,760
respondents noted that open source is

249
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,130
sometimes more of a science experiment

250
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,750
or it's like it's not exactly something

251
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,579
that's fully baked and especially starts

252
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,230
to fall over if you try to implement it

253
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:02,319
at some kind of scale beyond what the

254
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,540
author happened

255
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,650
had access to so if somebody wrote in

256
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,300
they were an environment it's an people

257
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,670
that premise works for ten people and it

258
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,170
won't work for anything else so we're

259
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,599
not gonna dive into the the support

260
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,189
issue specifically here

261
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,510
I think the probably the next thing to

262
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,130
do is actually take each one of these

263
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,560
and break them out into their own survey

264
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,180
to figure out you know exactly what kind

265
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,589
of issues people are dealing with now

266
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,750
that we know the general categories and

267
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:27,790
how they play also the ones that that

268
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,980
kind of didn't show up at all like how

269
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,449
to do feature customizations or how to

270
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,100
contribute to projects didn't show up

271
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,200
that kind of stuff but let's dive into

272
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:39,220
some of the specific challenges they're

273
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,900
here so survey respondents noted that a

274
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,590
part of the problem is knowing what

275
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:47,170
exists so long-standing projects like

276
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,520
snort Bros ricotta and map Metasploit

277
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,290
we've all heard of those things right

278
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,520
and they benefit from having sort of a

279
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,900
tribal knowledge when we come to

280
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,130
conferences like this we can talk to

281
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,449
people about hey what are you doing with

282
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:59,860
bro or Zeke or server kata and as well

283
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,810
as there's some coverage of all of those

284
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,890
tools and various certifications to go

285
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,719
to the sans class you're going to learn

286
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,360
about some of that kind of stuff for

287
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,310
example new projects they have some

288
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,190
maybe some exposure for things like demo

289
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,380
labs at Def Con or there's the Arsenal

290
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,090
series at blackhat but they'll get

291
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,710
almost no coverage from the press unless

292
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,030
they're backed by some large company so

293
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,250
if you're a Facebook or a Google when

294
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,839
you open source something that comes

295
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,670
with a press tour and a briefings

296
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,260
announcements and those kind of things

297
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,780
but if you're just you know someone

298
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,980
wrote a thing put it on github those are

299
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,209
really your only chances to get

300
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,310
something out there

301
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,320
so if you're an open source project

302
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:37,239
that's solving a unique problem you've

303
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,220
got a high barrier before even folks

304
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:43,150
understand that you exist right what's

305
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:45,640
out there so what we do tend to do an

306
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:47,050
open source is make lists let's see if

307
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:54,100
my slide thing works this time

308
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:55,449
nope so the one on the top there's the

309
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,340
one that at least when I ran into it

310
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,350
look the most feature completes its

311
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,210
nowhere net they have a little bit of a

312
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,100
split personality

313
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,740
it's a great site I'm not going to cite

314
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,440
at all but they talked about penetration

315
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,750
testing security auditing tools in

316
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,850
cyberpunk but they'll also cover sort of

317
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,380
defensive stuff and all that and I

318
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,899
should say these slides everything's not

319
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,819
working

320
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,100
the bottom actually has the address for

321
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:20,059
the slides which is on my website

322
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,649
anyways we'll get this stuff out this is

323
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:23,629
actually already live on the internet

324
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:26,660
which is why I'm presenting from a

325
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:29,689
browser so anyways all the stuff will be

326
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,089
available is available now just make

327
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:34,040
sure the links and stuff get out so the

328
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:35,869
second one begins the list of Awesome

329
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,149
lists there's this whole awesome list

330
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:39,920
section on github so the second one on

331
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:41,209
there is awesome incident response and

332
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,490
then we've got two awesome machine

333
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:45,050
learning even for cybersecurity then

334
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,910
we've got one specializing an awesome

335
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,319
threat detection then we get into

336
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,089
awesome forensics we get into more

337
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:51,589
general awesome security that gets more

338
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,269
general as we go down there's just the

339
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,579
awesome list everything that's awesome

340
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:58,519
and then there's the list of lists just

341
00:11:55,579 --> 00:12:00,258
to kind of round it all out so what we

342
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,879
do for open source security is

343
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:06,889
definitely we make a list we make lists

344
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:09,290
of lists we make awesome lists so one

345
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,850
thing we don't do in open source a lot

346
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,309
of in the commercial space a lot of

347
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,470
product reviews will come with in-depth

348
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:17,569
reviews comparisons right we'll dove to

349
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,429
kind of do a deep dive SC magazine for

350
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:22,069
example exists it seems like solely to

351
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:24,110
review yet another project our product

352
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:25,399
then compare them against each other or

353
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,579
compare me there's the previous year

354
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:31,009
that sort of thing then you've seen

355
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:32,829
things like this that take take it to an

356
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:35,300
extreme and they'll add categorizations

357
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:37,550
take all the vendors and kind of you

358
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,929
know lay them out just like this sans

359
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,128
even has in the back of their posters

360
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:42,490
that they send out they get a way to

361
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:44,929
categorize all the vendors into various

362
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,089
categories and tools and things like

363
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:50,689
that seems like a thing that that we're

364
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:53,629
missing so maybe what we should do in

365
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:55,730
open source is build upon things like

366
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:58,160
this to help maybe some add some

367
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,079
framework so this is the cyber defense

368
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,139
matrix does anyone heard of the cyber

369
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,829
defense matrix just a couple okay this

370
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:08,870
is really cool this is an O ASP project

371
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:11,109
from Sunil I think is that Bank of

372
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,549
America he's one of the ones behind it

373
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,230
so it's simply a framework right it's a

374
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:19,129
way to organize your thoughts it's not a

375
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:20,240
way to solve security by any means what

376
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:22,399
it does do is just take the NIST

377
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,529
cybersecurity framework identify protect

378
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,110
detect respond recover lays that out

379
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,410
across the top and then lays across the

380
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,940
site

381
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,290
angle things that you were talking about

382
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,690
so if you are a person trying to plan

383
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,269
out your security program you could use

384
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,550
this to say do I have a tool do I have a

385
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:39,920
way to identify devices I have a way to

386
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,329
identify things on my network right then

387
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,000
you could move across that to kind of

388
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:46,339
identify other gaps in your particular

389
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,680
security program all right so do I need

390
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:50,810
something to help me detect whatever

391
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,550
data crossing my network or whatever so

392
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,768
you can use that to sort of plan out

393
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,329
either gaps in your thing and your

394
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:58,430
security program or places that you need

395
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:00,319
to improve or talk about your successes

396
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:04,040
that kind of things just the framework

397
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:05,930
can we get there so maybe one of the

398
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,759
first things this is idea it's totally

399
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,719
experimental like I said my boss wants

400
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,850
me an experiment so here we are

401
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,230
experimenting so they were the first

402
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,060
things that mozilla could help with is

403
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,829
two Curie open-source solutions is to

404
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,500
inventory them alright so here's a work

405
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:20,420
in progress application this is a

406
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,240
director level code here so don't expect

407
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,769
anything great to catalogue open-source

408
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,420
tools so the idea was taking the

409
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:28,220
existing list we've got plenty of lists

410
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,550
we know where all the open source stuff

411
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:33,470
is and then maybe add some tags in there

412
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,630
to allow them to categorize the function

413
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,639
you'll notice the function that identify

414
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:40,009
recover things like that according to

415
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,779
the cybersecurity matrix and then maybe

416
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:44,779
get a better idea not necessarily a

417
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:46,250
vendor logo map sort of thing but at

418
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:48,410
least a searchable kind of thing that

419
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,839
would help you figure out oh I was heard

420
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,569
about siphon at a security conference

421
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,920
what's it do oh it does these things and

422
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:56,899
maybe we could detail some other stuff

423
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,519
about the stack and maybe uses Redis or

424
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:00,500
Mongo or it's written in Java or Python

425
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,060
or things like that then you've got more

426
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,380
information rather than just a list that

427
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,000
these things are all awesome

428
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:09,410
they're all in the same list because

429
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,750
they're all super awesome and then the

430
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,189
idea and the way the app works this app

431
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,689
is live as well and if it wasn't having

432
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:16,790
these problems of slide it would show

433
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:19,490
you a little bit more but some video

434
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,709
issues but the idea is that you can then

435
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,720
use all those things to tag or to select

436
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:25,099
the things that you're looking for and

437
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,449
then you get a list right so it's like

438
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,399
hey I want to find anything that's in

439
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:31,000
these categories and then you can get a

440
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,889
list of all the stuff that's out there

441
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,990
so the other thing that the respondent

442
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:39,380
said one of the big bar items on the

443
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,240
list is that super hard to tell in open

444
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,890
sport and

445
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,779
Saurus if a project is healthy enough to

446
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,569
use and rely on so great you can find

447
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,890
the code awesome I got the code what's

448
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,600
next right is this the thing that I'm

449
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,000
gonna plan my whole security program

450
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,560
around is this the thing I need to uh to

451
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,440
need some help I need some love it's got

452
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,229
some issues where as it sits on the

453
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,029
spectrum so here's an example of what I

454
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,000
think is a healthy project right so this

455
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:05,740
is just the github sad stuff if you

456
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,360
breathe down in the readme way way they

457
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,950
blowed and it doesn't include actual

458
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,380
references to production employments

459
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,480
there's some fortune X you know level

460
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,279
companies using it but if you look at

461
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,649
just the github stats itself it's got

462
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,160
191 releases that's amazing that's a lot

463
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:20,350
of releases

464
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,969
it's got active commits like two hours

465
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,339
ago or two days ago something like that

466
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,930
it's got plenty of stars if you like

467
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:27,490
stars it's got plenty of Forks if you

468
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,739
like Forks it's got branches it's got

469
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,589
everything it's even got issues it's got

470
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,600
all the kinds of stuff going on so

471
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:36,940
here's another one and this one is

472
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,490
harder to tell right it's not as much it

473
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,440
has zero releases it has the last commit

474
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:43,149
was six years ago but maybe it's done

475
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,220
maybe it's feature complete maybe this

476
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:46,660
thing it's just a honeypot program so

477
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,300
maybe this one wrote the best honeypot

478
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,730
you've ever seen and it's perfect right

479
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,529
out of a batch there's only had one one

480
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,810
or three commits to it and it's

481
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:58,329
perfectly done super hard to tell right

482
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,069
whether something is maybe unloved maybe

483
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:04,780
also it doesn't work I don't know sort

484
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:07,900
of - so the other part the other idea

485
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:09,970
for this catalog of apps is that github

486
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,740
as a rich API or a most open source

487
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:14,319
projects are in github so maybe this way

488
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,660
to make use of that to go figure out you

489
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,459
know are things like releases commits is

490
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,679
there a healthy balance of open closed

491
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:23,189
issues and I'm curious a few folks have

492
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:26,559
ideas about about that sort of thing so

493
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:29,320
here's an example of using that that API

494
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,240
to maybe rate the health of a project

495
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:37,990
based on the number of releases that's a

496
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:39,460
very simple idea or something else and

497
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,200
if you are a data science the sort of

498
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:46,320
person I would love your ideas about how

499
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,320
to do that in a more non director code

500
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,919
so and so then the idea is that with

501
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,419
this health rating as well you could

502
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,510
also use something like that

503
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,789
super easy table kind of thing to not

504
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,980
only filter by the rating the function

505
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:03,690
that you want but also get an idea of

506
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:09,750
the health of the potential solutions

507
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:11,910
that that you may be looking at and so

508
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,289
this is the this is the project that

509
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,360
we're talking about like I was gonna do

510
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:17,340
a demo but and I'm scared of them of a a

511
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,289
be set up so this is the projects out

512
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,580
there and github of course you'll have a

513
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:22,230
really hard time telling how healthy it

514
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,629
is there's like four commits there's no

515
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:28,710
releases there's also no issues so maybe

516
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,539
it's a completely feature complete so if

517
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,640
you want to help contribute to this by

518
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,990
all means please do and again the slides

519
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,049
and stuff will be out you can find all

520
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:41,190
this stuff afterwards or feel free to

521
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:42,900
have come talk to me afterwards okay so

522
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,700
we took a look at the the challenges and

523
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,010
potential solution areas to do some more

524
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,600
work in so let's pivot a bit and we're

525
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,980
gonna take a look at some open source

526
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,809
projects that you might not be aware of

527
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,380
you may be aware of them but probably

528
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:57,570
not and potentially help you in your

529
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,309
information security program so this is

530
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,500
a no particular order this isn't a

531
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:03,330
beauty contest this is my top 5 list by

532
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,010
any means these are just things that

533
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,379
that I've run into over the course of

534
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,150
time that I don't think are completely

535
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,380
knowledgeable in the community not

536
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,390
everyone knows about it I think they do

537
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,679
hold a place and I think in a lot of

538
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,409
playing a lot of cases they're unique

539
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,500
they do a thing that no commercial tool

540
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:22,350
does yet so the first one we're going to

541
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,909
talk about is a cloud mapping tool so

542
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,580
this Larry is called cloud mapper

543
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:30,929
it's from duo Labs dual labs is kind of

544
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:34,049
like I says the labs are do like I says

545
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:35,909
it's super easy to kind of point this at

546
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:37,110
your AWS environment downloads a bunch

547
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:39,299
of information about your AWS

548
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,740
environment and then shows it to you I

549
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,900
can't away that I don't think I've ever

550
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,539
seen anything show it to you at all

551
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,909
they've got a demo sites if we could see

552
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:50,070
the top of the URL we could see where

553
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:51,240
the demo site is but we can't anyway so

554
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,549
you can go play with this without

555
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,500
actually having to point it at your AWS

556
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:57,270
account so where this is useful as if

557
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,929
for example whatever you trying to

558
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,340
figure out

559
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:00,899
that CloudFormation template that you

560
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,759
just stood up did actually create things

561
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:04,619
that you wanted it to make did the

562
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:05,970
intern spit up Bitcoin miners they

563
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:08,189
didn't bother to tell you about and then

564
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:11,399
left the company did you remember to

565
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:13,169
turn down that stack of expensive ec2

566
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:14,908
instances that you wanted to do just for

567
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:16,169
a demo or for a one-off thing or just to

568
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:18,299
see if those things are actually worth

569
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:19,889
it that kind of stuff or if you're doing

570
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:22,200
instant response it's useful if you're

571
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:24,090
brought into an AWS account you have no

572
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,249
idea you're trying to get context right

573
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,439
an easy way to just do that and get

574
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:30,570
maybe a visual idea of something that

575
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,279
that would have been a lot harder to do

576
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:39,450
just clicking around the never-ending

577
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:41,220
AWS endless list of icons right the next

578
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,929
one we're gonna talk about those cloud

579
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,570
mapper from do labs next one we're gonna

580
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:47,490
talk about is TLS fingerprinting anyone

581
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,499
familiar with the concept TLS

582
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,659
fingerprinting just a couple okay so

583
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:55,009
we'll dive into so what it does and this

584
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:56,580
is ja3 from Salesforce so there's

585
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:57,899
implementations of it

586
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,178
Salesforce seems they have the one

587
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:02,279
that's kind of captured the mind share

588
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:04,230
if you will so the idea is that this is

589
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:06,269
this is a client hello or it's a clients

590
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,279
initiating SSO connection to a server

591
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:10,759
these are all the things that go on in

592
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,570
there so the idea between behind a ja3

593
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,190
fingerprint is that you take the

594
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,590
combination of things listed across here

595
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,850
session cipher all that and make it into

596
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,889
a fingerprint that uniquely identifies

597
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,869
the client that's making that that

598
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:26,039
connection no two clients have different

599
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:27,809
are the same same signature there so

600
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,158
here's an example of some just to kind

601
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:31,230
of give you some context for what you

602
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,240
can do so here's the first one is the

603
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,529
fingerprint for the standard tor client

604
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,700
so if you're trying to find tor in your

605
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:38,279
network that's what you would look for

606
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,679
for to see a tor client making an ssl

607
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:42,720
connection to somewhere similar there's

608
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,730
one for the dry Dex malware and then of

609
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,470
course Metasploit right can do the same

610
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,779
thing if it's connecting out to SSL this

611
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:51,330
would be the ja3 fingerprint that you

612
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:53,399
would see for that so it's useful for

613
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,809
finding not only bad things but also

614
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:56,309
finding good things so let's say you had

615
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:58,950
an app like a mobile app and you had an

616
00:21:56,309 --> 00:22:00,658
API on the end of that and you wanted to

617
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,210
know what sort of things we're talking

618
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:05,279
to your API is it always your app is it

619
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,379
someone doing account checking just

620
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,730
checking for username passwords that

621
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:09,990
kind of stuff are there old

622
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,540
versions of your app that may not be

623
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,340
valid anymore or maybe you want to just

624
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:19,530
monitor your own infrastructure for

625
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:23,780
rogue traffic like this so and if you've

626
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:26,490
got this kind of J 3 comes in Sorocaba

627
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,320
Zeke I get used to saying Zeke as well

628
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,490
so if you're taking that stuff and

629
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,678
throwing it in like in this case

630
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,450
elasticsearch it's very easy to just

631
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,860
find it you can either just search one

632
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,360
off like this case we're just searching

633
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,189
for a week's or the traffic to see if we

634
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,678
got in that case it was Metis points

635
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,840
interpreter J three fingerprint and

636
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,549
nothing so that's great or you can set

637
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,530
alerts obviously on if you see that kind

638
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:48,000
of traffic in your environment as well

639
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,160
so it's super useful for that kind of

640
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,410
thing and not a thing I think you can

641
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,360
get from from commercial doing

642
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:58,500
necessarily they're actually just

643
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:02,070
implementing re-implementing J III so

644
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,870
this next one this is not unique I'm

645
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,418
African of the speaker earlier was

646
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,530
talking about this so but there are a

647
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,030
couple things unique about this

648
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:12,090
implementation that I thought it would

649
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:13,490
pick up so this is check pone so this is

650
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,520
checking against have I been poned

651
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:19,230
database for either email or password

652
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,450
exposures the unique thing about this is

653
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,799
written in rust so rust if you haven't

654
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,620
looked at it it's super cool new

655
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,790
language it's becoming the core of a lot

656
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,049
of what I said I wasn't gonna talk about

657
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,760
browsers but it's the only thing I will

658
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:32,070
talk about browsers become the core of a

659
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,620
lot of what Firefox is built on it's a

660
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,240
super great language it is obtuse and

661
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,739
really tough to pick up if you haven't

662
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,090
actually tried to do anything you're a

663
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,220
long way to go before we can write a

664
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,570
program I think the reason I'm bringing

665
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,990
this up is that this is a great example

666
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:47,280
of a task and once you see it

667
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,900
implemented in trust you start to

668
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,010
understand rust a lot better right so if

669
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,870
you're looking to understand rust

670
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,220
this is a great way to do it just look

671
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,689
at the source code for this app because

672
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,070
it's really well-written and it

673
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,720
accomplishes something that's useful

674
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,418
right so you can take this just like it

675
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,669
says you can kind of one-off to either

676
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:05,490
passwords or you can do email addresses

677
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:06,840
or you can do a list a file full of

678
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,820
email addresses and just have it do it

679
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,230
is like a cron job sort of thing every

680
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,090
day no just go out and search to see if

681
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,100
you've got any new breaches on that

682
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,990
stuff so this is super useful tool it

683
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,580
never sends your password out if you're

684
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,890
worried about that uses the K and anima

685
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,600
T mathematical properties so it takes a

686
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,970
hash

687
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,500
of your password as you type it in takes

688
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,690
the first thing as five characters of

689
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,190
that sends that off then gets back

690
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,950
anywhere from like I think it's 30 to

691
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,269
300 different sets of hashes that could

692
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,460
match and then on the client side is

693
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:35,960
where it does that magic so it's also a

694
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,720
super interesting thing to see how that

695
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,509
gets implemented in rust as well so

696
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:48,590
again I bring up learning it's a really

697
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:50,210
great project to take a look at so the

698
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,370
next one we'll talk about here and I

699
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,960
think this is a fifth one so there's a

700
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,389
project called binary alert from our

701
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,889
friends at her B&B so airbnb not only

702
00:24:56,389 --> 00:25:00,860
will rent you a place to also make great

703
00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:02,449
security software no they do a couple of

704
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,678
things that people are familiar with

705
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,480
like stream alert but I thought I'd pick

706
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,370
on binary alert because it's a really

707
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,409
useful thing so the idea is that if

708
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,090
you've got a set of files and you need

709
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:15,440
to go through those files with Yarra for

710
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:17,059
signatures great idea about doing stuff

711
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,669
in AWS right to do is kind of one-off

712
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:22,519
tasks necessarily always have to do it

713
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:24,980
so what binary ler does is help tame the

714
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,899
sort of Rube Goldberg machine that AWS

715
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,090
is it makes it easy to send files to s3

716
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:32,178
buckets and then scan those things

717
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,949
against analyze set up Yarra signatures

718
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:35,269
that either you have or you made up

719
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,580
because you found an infection somewhere

720
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:39,740
or maybe you've got a threatened tail

721
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,509
feed of your signature is coming your

722
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,519
way and do a bunch of different stuff

723
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:45,080
with it so you can either just send

724
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,700
emails to you about it you can send

725
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,220
alerts through a variety of things that

726
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,889
but nice super easy way to to get that

727
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,000
kind of fairly complex AWS

728
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:57,490
infrastructure set up without knowing

729
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:06,379
what you're doing and just living off

730
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:09,919
the benefit of sorry more to go so next

731
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:12,168
I'll bring up is Falco so Falco is a

732
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,970
syscall monitoring tools what we're

733
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:17,509
talking about so this calls down at the

734
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:19,519
audits sort of level of the Linux Linux

735
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:22,159
system right so you open a network port

736
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,900
or talk to a file or open a session or

737
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,610
that kind of thing so assisting

738
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,350
we'll have a commercial and they have an

739
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,959
open-source tool this is the open source

740
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:32,370
version of it Falco's meant to monitor

741
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,840
containers so if you've got like a

742
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,550
kubernetes infrastructure running a

743
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,840
bunch of containers you run one falco

744
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:39,090
instance it monitors all those

745
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,260
containers simultaneously and the neat

746
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,659
thing about falco is they've got a

747
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,000
really great set of rules written

748
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:46,920
against that so what you can see at the

749
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,750
top is just the Falco instance and then

750
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,120
the bottom is someone using a container

751
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,960
and you can see the rule is firing as

752
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,729
they go on

753
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,500
so it'll loop back around here in a

754
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,870
second but you can see everything from

755
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,790
just there was a session and then on the

756
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,110
container opened so if a developer gave

757
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,820
you a container and like I don't need

758
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,199
access to it that's just fine I'll never

759
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,510
need to look at the thing at all and you

760
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,950
catch him log on to the thing then you

761
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,629
can start to hook this up to rules to

762
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,670
say if everyone ever logs into a

763
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,250
container kill it when a market has

764
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,630
tainted never use it again or you can

765
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,370
let that kind of stuff go and you can

766
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,660
say alright let you get on the box but

767
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,939
if you start doing things like padding

768
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:24,090
out it's a password or replacing LS with

769
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,400
some stuff and also rules written for

770
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,720
that it has a really extensive rule set

771
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,460
it goes on and on and on it's kind of

772
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,380
amazing when you look at it the amount

773
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,580
of things that they've they've covered

774
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,080
they've even covered for like

775
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,370
vulnerability scanners and what they do

776
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,199
when they get onto a machine of

777
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,790
whitelist and some of those kind of

778
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
things so it's a real good kind of

779
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:42,960
Kickstarter if you need something to

780
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,650
monitor containers on there and then

781
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:52,920
again you can run that infrastructure as

782
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:54,420
well I should say the other thing the

783
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,780
other thing is that you also don't need

784
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,820
to modify the containers to do that so I

785
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:04,470
said five but everybody likes a bonus

786
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,790
Jonas so will recover a 6-1 and I'll go

787
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,540
a little bit old-school if this is not a

788
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:13,230
new tool by any means but it's called

789
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:15,450
geo tail so as in OpenGL and the idea is

790
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,580
very very simple if you can SSH into a

791
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:20,490
thing and you can tail a file you can

792
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:22,639
get a OpenGL visualization of it so in

793
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:25,290
this case this is just the authors

794
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,270
visualization he's just SS aging into

795
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:29,460
his web server and then looking at his

796
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,900
traffic as it flows across the screen so

797
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,810
if you need a simple way to impress your

798
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,980
boss like maybe you have a new boss and

799
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:38,090
you need a simple way to impress your

800
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,309
boss just find a really busy

801
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,720
file somewhere that you can SSH into and

802
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:44,720
just pull this up on your monitor every

803
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,419
time he goes by and you'll have a duly

804
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,460
impressed boss for sure it's really

805
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:51,590
great use a long time ago I think

806
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:55,130
there's even a I think I wrote a plug-in

807
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,600
to do it for network firewall logs that

808
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,100
kind of stuff so super easy to modified

809
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,658
to so if it's not just web servers

810
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:08,719
really is literally anything you can

811
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:10,130
tale you can so this is again it's a

812
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,559
preview of work that Mozilla is

813
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,149
considering doing for 2019 along with

814
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,520
some recommended open source projects to

815
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:18,649
take for a spin if you'd like to help

816
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,049
we'd love some feedback on problems or

817
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:23,689
solutions so if you want you can help me

818
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:24,950
with this crazy catalog idea either

819
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,919
flush it out whether this is a good idea

820
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,690
or get off the ground from the director

821
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,720
level sort of code into some actual user

822
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:34,279
interface sewer level code if you like

823
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,500
the tool just as is you can start adding

824
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:38,179
stuff to it help so a crowd source of

825
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,850
inventory tags some stuff give some

826
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:42,620
ideas about that and if you are in need

827
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,969
in 2019 consider an open source project

828
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,649
there's a whole bunch of them that we

829
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:47,510
covered during the course are here

830
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:49,070
people are definitely using open source

831
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:51,529
now you know which ones are in use which

832
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:55,129
ones are actually useful and you've got

833
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:58,270
yourself a road map for 2019 so with

834
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,270
that thank you very much

835
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,659
and since I couldn't do a demo we got

836
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,049
lots of time for questions

837
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:09,049
other questions

838
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:48,470
ya know so at the bottom there is the is

839
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:56,659
the address so Jeff my comm slash

840
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:57,529
besides PDX 2018 is there you go there

841
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:58,880
the slides

842
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:06,169
there's also speaker notes you can

843
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:07,549
replay everything I just said I guess

844
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:09,740
that's right here actually I could I

845
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:11,629
couldn't do this demo thing I got it

846
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,100
written up there so this is the the

847
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,380
actual app itself so this is the address

848
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,840
for the app would say catalog security

849
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:22,179
Allison orgasm is Mozilla spelled

850
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,178
backwards it's our development site

851
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:43,100
security it's also in the will demo

852
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:44,840
quickly so this is this code written in

853
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,649
in meteor which if you're not familiar

854
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,529
with meteors it's one of my favorites

855
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:53,239
tools mostly because so what I want you

856
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:56,690
to notice is the the top line there were

857
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,149
it says psyphon sim triage system so

858
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,580
I've got this same address on my phone

859
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:07,010
I'm gonna type in a thing and you're

860
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:09,590
gonna see B type so the meteor is a tool

861
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:12,129
that does sort of reactive maybe you

862
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,129
guys see me type

863
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:26,650
demo of failure never had a demo fail

864
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:30,840
before I know what to do anyways what's

865
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:32,920
supposed to happen is that you would see

866
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,750
whatever I typed the never show up in

867
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,150
real time but meters failing me today

868
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:39,460
anyways that's the address for the for

869
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,850
the catalog of open-source security

870
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,850
solutions

871
00:32:50,820 --> 00:33:00,760
it's just Jeff Brenner comm be sighs PDX

872
00:32:54,430 --> 00:33:04,860
2018 okay yeah it's probably tweeted

873
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,860
also any other questions

874
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,409
Microsoft only github yeah that's an

875
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:15,280
interesting question what to think about

876
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:17,500
Microsoft own and github yeah I don't

877
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:22,928
know what to think it's a real conundrum

878
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:24,220
right it's like a bit of a mind

879
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:26,530
especially for a company like Mozilla

880
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:30,390
obviously it's so invested almost 2,000

881
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:30,389
repos on there like moving anytime soon

882
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,860
we do have to compete and get along with

883
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,540
Microsoft and compete and get along with

884
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,639
Google and compete and get along with a

885
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:45,340
lot of people at the same time so the

886
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:47,260
internet it's a collaborative place we

887
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,730
have the question was have we deployed

888
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,890
open-source security tools at Mozilla

889
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:53,500
yes we're kinda in the same category so

890
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,030
Zeek is a big one for us Erick gotta

891
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,950
sericata as well

892
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,899
Nihao presents kia my team has done a

893
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,400
bunch of presentations on what we've got

894
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,470
it was like a 40 gigabit per second

895
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,360
infrastructure just built on commodity

896
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:05,740
hardware that does all that kind of pack

897
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,379
in capturing reporting and all that

898
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:11,879
stuff as well as we've written some

899
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:13,690
other tools so mig is a client-side

900
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:16,779
solution that we've written that takes

901
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,280
privacy into account so it never

902
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,690
retrieves anything off the endpoint

903
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,580
system we can just kind of ask it

904
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,109
questions hey are there systems out

905
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,940
there that have a file that matches this

906
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:26,799
hash it'll just answer yes or no it

907
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:29,470
doesn't actually get the file from those

908
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,419
systems so it's maybe a unique case for

909
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:33,100
us I don't know other companies have

910
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:35,830
that same same sort of problem but

911
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:39,040
definitely a problem that we have and

912
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:40,119
then most of our sim is probably the one

913
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,649
that rely on the most all that

914
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,270
information comes back into to do a

915
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:44,649
vulnerability management it's a response

916
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,509
alerting that kind of stuff

917
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,629
yeah so yeah we're all about deploying

918
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:51,550
open source and an oddity of course kind

919
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:53,489
of like the Falco stuff is across all of

920
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,240
our Linux environment to report back

921
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:56,500
everything on there which is super

922
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,629
useful is really nice avail just have

923
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:02,310
every command every run on every Linux

924
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,310
server ever at your fingertips

925
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:11,779
other questions okay great thanks very

926
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,779
much thank you

927
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,360
you
