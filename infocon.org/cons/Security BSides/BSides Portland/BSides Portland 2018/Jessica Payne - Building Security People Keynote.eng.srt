1
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,420
[Jessica:] So, hello, good morning, today we're going to talk about building security people.

2
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,680
normally when I give talks, I tell things
like incident response stories, or I talk

3
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,519
about attacker trends, or maybe I talk
about cool malware, or if you know me

4
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,790
really well I'll tell you weird tricks
to hack Windows, like plugging in a smart

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,680
card to run arbitrary java as system. A
lot of times you'll hear me talk about

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,840
Event ID 1102. Who knows what event ID
1102 is? That's your event logs for

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,470
cleared. It's probably the event log
monitoring that you should be doing. A

8
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,790
lot of times in my talks I troll Will Harmj0y, but that's not why I'm here today.

9
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,410
Today I am here to exit my comfort
zone and I'm going to talk about

10
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,899
security people. I'm a security person
you're probably a security person if

11
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:11,040
you're here. Security people, have,
unplugged my laptop.

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,000
[ Audience Laughter ]

13
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,300
I don't think it's me.

14
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:40,520
Okay so I'm gonna turn my laptop around and you're gonna watch it on this little screen.

15
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:47,080
[ Audience Laughter ] Alright here we go.

16
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,399
I told you that we would be ad-libbing 
and doing a rap battle.

17
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,280
Alright cool, so, security
people seem to be cool. Security people

18
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,520
seem to be relatively well compensated.
They seem to travel around. They seem to

19
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,429
do cool things. They seem to be able to
do things, like aftermarket editions that

20
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:07,899
invalidate the warranties on their
otherwise boring Volkswagens, which are

21
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:11,230
totally done responsibly and in
compliance with all laws of Washington

22
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,569
State. Security people are cool, so
everybody wants to be a security person.

23
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,310
I hear a lot of people saying I want to
be a security person. Is there a roadmap

24
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:27,069
to being a security person. Do we have
any way with- we have one single path to

25
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,268
get to being a security person. And
oftentimes, I get this in the form of the

26
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:37,120
question of. "How did you get to where you
are?". At which point I'm like, no, no, no no

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,720
no, this is danger. You really don't want
to know this. You really want to stop.

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,590
Because the reason that I'm a security
person and the reason that I'm on this

29
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,790
stage giving you a keynote today, or have
given any talk in security, is because I

30
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,880
am an epic failure. We're gonna talk
about me. This is awkward and

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,690
uncomfortable, but let's talk about how
my life was supposed to look. So I

32
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,560
actually started college at 14. That was
kind of cool because I come from the

33
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,069
middle of nowhere where people don't
even go to college. And then I was a

34
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:10,208
dancer. I was in a pre professional
ballet company. I thought I might

35
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,690
actually graduate from college. I thought
I might become some sort of forensic

36
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:19,370
pathologist, dancer, ninja, secret agent,
and maybe I'd become Carmen Sandiego. 
[ Audience Laughter ]

37
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,920
But what really happens? So I started my
college at 14, got that part done. And

38
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,649
then I got incredibly ill and actually
failed out of college. Okay. But then I

39
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,590
went and I actually got a job at
Carnegie Mellon. I went to school at

40
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,850
Carnegie Mellon and then I dropped out
of Carnegie Mellon and I took an

41
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,290
incredibly awesome high paying job at a
very fancy law firm, where I was promptly

42
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:50,970
fired for being a jerk. [ Audience Laughter ] 
But then, I received a call on my cell phone that

43
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,880
had this 425 area code and said
Redmond Washington and I'm like why, why

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,959
are you calling me? and it turns out it
was Microsoft. And I said I never want to

45
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,920
work at Microsoft. I don't really like
Microsoft. And someone gave me the advice

46
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,380
of, well if you want to change something
perhaps the best way to do that is from

47
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:17,310
the inside. So now I work at Microsoft. 
[ Audience Laughter ]
But all throughout that entire chain of

48
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,160
events all throughout my life and
probably yours

49
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,070
there are turning points. There are
decisions that come up to you and there

50
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,540
are chances for you to kind of make a
change in what you're doing. And often as

51
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,750
you're going along you're going to hear
negative voices. Those negative voices

52
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,900
might come from other people or they
might come from inside your own head. And

53
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,710
those negative voices might tell you to
stop what you're doing, or do something,

54
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,969
or because you fell off the path that
you intended in life that, therefore, you

55
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:48,690
are bad at everything. [ Sighing ] Okay, this is
actually something someone once said to

56
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,560
me they said "I wouldn't bother applying
there don't get your hopes up." Well that

57
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,800
was for Carnegie Mellon, and I did apply
there and I did get that job, and okay.

58
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,160
This is something else that someone said
to me. This is actually a comment that

59
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,200
was left on an internal presentation I
gave at Microsoft in 2016. "Presenter has

60
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,729
been presenting on topics they don't
have sufficient background in" Well

61
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:15,900
considering APT's were only invented in
2014, who the heck has sufficient

62
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,060
background in incident response. Because
that is what I was presenting on, so

63
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,770
we're all insecurity people. 
[ Audience Laughter ]

64
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,760
Because it turns out, that those negative
voices once you get them outside or in,

65
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,200
do make you feel a little bit insecure
but I also like the phrase "insecurity

66
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,090
people" because when I decided to become
a security person most of the people who

67
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,710
were famous for being security people
were insecurity people. They were breaking

68
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,419
things. They were hacking things. There
was not a lot of discussion about fixing

69
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:54,780
things, and there certainly were no
presentations on the windows firewall. 
[ Audience Laughter ]

70
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,140
So I joined Microsoft. It's been a little
bit of a journey. It's been a little bit

71
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,650
of a winding road, like everyone's life
is. There have been moments where I could

72
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,070
have absolutely mic dropped on what I'm
doing. I could have left, I could have

73
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,520
chased money, I could have chased titles,
I could have chased other things, but I

74
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,900
joined Microsoft with a reason, and I stuck
it out, and eventually this happened.

75
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,030
That's pretty cool. But when we think
about that, when we think about what we

76
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,440
do in our life and why we do it. Here are
some things I've got to do as an epic

77
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,300
failure. Well I got to do this, I got to
do this, I've done this. Somebody in the

78
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,170
audience likes this cuz they tweeted me
at it. I did that. I presented on the same

79
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,600
stage as Raymond Chen. I discussed
the best way to make kale salad with my

80
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,000
coworker, while incidentally we were being
filmed for The Today Show. 
[ Audience Laughter ]

81
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,530
I did this, which is a presentation on
demystifying Windows Firewall so now

82
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,090
there exists one. In my life as an epic
failure, where I did not intend to be a

83
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,179
security person, I've got to go lots of
cool places. I've been to Switzerland,

84
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,830
I've been to Poland, been to Hong Kong, I
went to Hobbiton, I took a selfie with an emu 
[ Audience Laughter ]

85
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:05,289
one of my talks is actually in the
new hire training for my division. Okay.

86
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,560
So if I'm a failure,
and it took me getting to be a failure to

87
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,300
become a security person, I'm pretty
fuckin good at it. [ Audience Laughter ]

88
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,670
Okay, so I've talked about myself. That
was really awkward

89
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,090
we got that part out of the way. HXS
files are actually just portable

90
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:25,010
executables. A portable executable is
something that can be used to execute

91
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,490
code. You can make things with different
extensions that are also portable

92
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,740
executables that don't end in dot EXE or dot DLL. This is one of them. Okay, I feel

93
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,320
better now. I'm not the only one. When we
talk about building security people, so

94
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,190
many of my friends have a story that
looks like that. A story that looks like

95
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,480
I didn't actually plan to be here, I had
to suffer a little bit to get here, and

96
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,320
nobody really gave me instructions on
how to do it, so I'm gonna talk about one

97
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,250
of my awesome friends. I'm gonna talk
about Devon Kerr, human being. Devon Kerr

98
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,330
has since changed into that, where now he
is the director of response at endgame.

99
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,590
You may know him from this amazing whitepaper on WMI. Literally the whitepaper

100
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,090
on WMI. If you haven't read it, go read
it. So let's talk about Devon's career

101
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,390
journey. Devon's career journey looks a
little bit like this

102
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,650
he worked on a farm. He was a junior
Linux admin. He did UV pasteurization

103
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,760
systems for dairy farms. He worked at
college he did humanities in college. He

104
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,080
worked at a restaurant, multiple roles. He
did an e-commerce startup, then he did

105
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,849
technology retail. He did bridge
maintenance. He did college again. this

106
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,170
time for network administration then he
did roofing repair, specializing in tile, slate and copper.

107
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,140
He then moonlighted, did a little bit of

108
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,030
last wire. He did some more moonlighting.
He did barn restorations, specifically

109
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:46,970
the 1880 to 1920s period. [ Audience Laughter ] He then did masonry, he's actually very good at

110
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,850
masonry. He did ISP operations, he did
some highly available infrastructure.

111
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,150
Wireless infrastructure, did some
forensic lab construction, a little bit

112
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,930
more forensic stuff. He did security
operations he did IR consulting at

113
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:08,989
Mandiant, then he did IR consulting at
Mandiant: A FireEye Company. [ Audience Laughter ] and now he's director of

114
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,850
response at Endgame. So lots of people as I talked to
have this sort of journey in their life

115
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,330
where things are not necessarily laid
out for them the way that they should be.

116
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:22,070
So okay, now we're a success. We're
successes, supposedly.

117
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,860
We're pretty cool, we have cool jobs, we
do cool things, but now what? We had Blue

118
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,560
Hat a couple weeks ago.
Blue Hat is Microsoft's wonderful

119
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,489
security conference and our keynote
presenter had this in his keynote he's

120
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,040
like, "why am I here?"
and he's talking about a conversation he

121
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,740
had with someone where he said, "I didn't
know you were in security" and that

122
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,940
person said, "yeah, it's pretty great." and
he said, "I'm burnt out" and I, um, totally

123
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,110
not me, said, "You should write a deck about that." So that's what our keynote

124
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,940
came from, because in my version of that
conversation which, incidentally and

125
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,180
coincidentally I totally had a
conversation like that too. I said, "the

126
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:02,089
thing that keeps me going is mentoring
people." I do a lot of cool stuff on a day

127
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:07,400
to day basis. I get to fly around the
world. I get to actually save people's

128
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,970
infrastructures or in one or two
instances literally save people buy

129
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,600
stuff for that we're doing. I get to see
a lot of cool stuff, I get to do a lot of

130
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,700
cool things, but what's really given me
the most optimism recently in my career

131
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,920
has been being able to actually take
people and uplift them and build my own

132
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,660
security people. Because it's really
weird and kind of uplifting to be able

133
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,650
to take someone who comes from a similar
background to you and save them some of

134
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,040
the steps in the journey. So we're gonna
talk about one of the security people,

135
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,660
we're gonna talk about guy named Justin.
So Justin, he prior to 2018, had work

136
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,980
experience that includes climbing
telephone poles, he was of doing wiring

137
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,650
of telephone cables, and he had submitted
over 152 job applications. In 2018 he

138
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,240
joined the Windows Defender ATP
hunting team as a vendor, he works for us

139
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,490
as a vendor on a contract.
He logs his investigations that he

140
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,170
does into the Intel system that my team
runs. One of the things he did was he

141
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,069
discovered a massive malware campaign using
an Oracle WebLogic 0day which was

142
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:10,579
followed by Eternal Blue to move
laterally throughout Networks.

143
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:17,699
Achievement unlocked, Senpai has noticed
you. [ Audience Laughter ] So I was like wow, okay, this is kind

144
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:22,139
of cool, you're actually doing really
cool work and you're really smart. What

145
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,579
can we do with this? It turns out what we
can do with this is give him absolutely

146
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:31,079
anything he will work on it and he will
learn it. So what he does now is he has

147
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:35,008
found a massive human operated
ransomware campaign, he discovered over

148
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:39,480
three apts on customer networks that
would have been undetected, he presented

149
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,660
at blue hat with me and he held a 30
minute conversation with a guy named

150
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,910
John Lambert. You may know him from
Twitter about hunting methodologies. John

151
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,719
Lambert's what's called a technical
fellow at Microsoft. I don't think Justin

152
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,170
understands that most people don't hold
30-minute conversations with John

153
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,339
Lambert in their first year as a
security person. So what makes this

154
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,589
different right this is a person who
applied to 152 jobs and didn't get them.

155
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:09,389
This is the person who is almost the
same age as me why did they not get a

156
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:14,730
security job until then? They are clearly
disturbingly threateningly brilliant

157
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:22,230
and motivated. Why? It's opportunity, right?
Opportunities are what allow people to

158
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,639
thrive. When you get a chance to do
something and you get a chance to have

159
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,199
somebody who's going to guide you along
the way. When we think about how we build

160
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:35,490
people up and how we give them things to
learn. Justin actually went to college

161
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,990
for network security he has a degree in
it, but it didn't work, right? It did not

162
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,819
get him the opportunities that he needed.
Opportunities come through different

163
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:48,809
places and we need to make them a lot
less random. Because when they're random

164
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,110
opportunities that's how you get career
paths that look like Devon's and mine.

165
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,290
What can we do to get those
opportunities to people and help

166
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:00,809
identify them faster? As a side note
yesterday I actually learned that it

167
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:05,100
wasn't me who inspired Justin to be a
security person at all, he actually went

168
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,460
to a Nine Inch Nails concert with Andy
Robbins who wrote bloodhound in 2014.

169
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:15,520
Okay. Andy showed him pen testing on his
laptop which apparently changed his life

170
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,149
and made him want to be a security
person from that five-minute interaction.

171
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:24,930
So this is yet another example of a
SpecterOps person being cooler than me.
[ Audience Laughter ]

172
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,140
Incidentally he discovered that because
one of the things that I teach the

173
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,319
people that I'm mentoring is that their
main responsibility is to give back in

174
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,110
whatever way they can
and Justin chose to do that by donating

175
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,740
to MDA which is the big cause that Andy
supports. So if you like bloodhound and

176
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,910
if you want to give back donate to MDA.
Also, I haven't actually seen Nine Inch

177
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,430
Nails in person and I love them,
so I'm jealous. But impact. Impact in

178
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,260
those 15 minutes that Andy didn't even
remember occurred he changed someone's

179
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:59,200
life. He showed them something that he
didn't know existed, right? Those 15

180
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,910
minutes of Andy firing up his laptop and
doing whatever he was doing in 2014

181
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:10,240
changed Justin's life. You can do that
too, right? This is an opportunity that's

182
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,010
being presented by exposing people to
things they've never seen before. Where I

183
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,939
come from, in the middle of nowhere
Pennsylvania, nobody knows it's actually

184
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,070
possible to work at Microsoft. It, like,
the career options or drive a truck or get pregnant.

185
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:30,850
[ Audience Laughter ] 
I wish I was kidding, I'm sorry. But that is an opportunity

186
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,950
for impact and an opportunity to give
someone opportunity. Talk to people who

187
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:41,529
don't even know security people exist
and you can have the creation of an

188
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:46,870
opportunity for someone. But opportunity
alone doesn't actually give it. People

189
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,500
that really succeed they have success
helpers and they have things that are

190
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,070
maybe innate to them. They're people
that are called self-starters, in

191
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,250
Silicon Valley speak. They're people
who kind of like just go with the flow

192
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,480
and know what to do. That is in no way
shape or form something that's natural.

193
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,410
If you're a self-starter you probably
learned it through failing a lot as a

194
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,610
child. Maybe you played Mario and kept
falling off of things that's how you

195
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,470
become a self-starter. So what does a
success helper look like for a

196
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,130
self-starter person? How can you give
somebody who you've given an opportunity

197
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:23,200
to, the groundwork for how to move
forward? Well, with

198
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,920
Justin's case, he takes his notes and
then he shares his notes with others he

199
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,939
mentors other people to make them better
he actually reads and watches what I

200
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,510
suggest. Shocking. There's a lot of people
who will say, you know, "teach me your

201
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,260
magical stuff" and then I hand them a 30
page document and a bunch of videos

202
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,660
and then I asked them what they thought
of them and they're like,  "Oh I didn't watch

203
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:48,130
them", I'm like, "Oh... okay." He has questions. It is
okay to ask questions, like, I'm sure it

204
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,160
probably was pretty freaking
intimidating the first moment when I

205
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:58,329
looked at him and said, "that's not how
DNS works.", [ Audience Laughter ] 
but then he said, "please tell

206
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:04,030
me how DNS works". So if you're
working with someone, questions. The

207
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,660
biggest thing though is he built on his
knowledge and tries new things as he's

208
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,140
learned new stuff he's developed new
ways to hunt inside of Windows Defender

209
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,120
ATP telemetry. He's built on what he
knows to increase his capabilities. We

210
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,170
don't just stop at what we know. I did
not just stop at Windows event logs, in

211
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:25,000
spite of what my blog might say. You
learn more and you go beyond that, right?

212
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,830
And you bring their own perspective and
uncover new things this is important. New

213
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,060
people see things differently than you
do. They see things in a different light

214
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,130
based on their life and their cultural
experiences. Someone who has come from a

215
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,490
different background than you is going
to see things differently than you and

216
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,470
that's gonna give you new perspective. So
when you give someone an opportunity you

217
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,640
can also give them a framework for
success by teaching them how to do these

218
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,770
things. So we can scale success. We can
actually make this carry on because this

219
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:02,470
is Michael. also known as PB. PB is who
Justin is mentoring, so we can scale this,

220
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:07,390
because you'll notice that what makes PB successful is he takes notes, he reads

221
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,020
them, he shares them with others, he
watches the stuff he suggested to,

222
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,889
he asks questions, he builds knowledge
and he brought a completely new

223
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,540
perspective to things because he comes from
a different technological background. But

224
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,449
what came out of both of these people
when I was working with them? They went

225
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,030
to school together.
They went to school, they did the same

226
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,990
program. And what they told me out of
everything I taught them, by yelling at

227
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,730
them, was. "we didn't learn any of this in
school".

228
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,700
So these are people that literally
followed what should have been the

229
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,210
roadmap to being a security person. And
I'm not throwing their school under the

230
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,260
bus. They learned really really good
things there. They learned a lot of very

231
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,430
practical knowledge, but actually, Will
Harmj0y, a person who I troll in every

232
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:52,990
talk, told me the other day that he had a
dev background. He knew how to code but

233
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,280
he didn't know how to apply it until he
met the guy who runs SpecterOps. He's

234
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,020
the one who taught him how to actually
apply the knowledge he had. So what

235
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:07,810
didn't they learn in school? They didn't
learn how to apply what they know or how

236
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,290
to think. This is the real-world
experience that all of us grizzled

237
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,820
veterans who have tried to fix something
on a Saturday morning know. So how can we

238
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,780
kind of get that moving and what can we
do to make that better? Because the

239
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,010
important part about security is it
involves humans. So humans are a

240
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:30,520
fundamental flaw or gift to security right
so we get a lot of flack on humans in

241
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,560
security because they do things like
enable macros, [ Audience Laughter ] but humans are also,

242
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:40,659
thank you, thank you, but humans are also what
allow us to scale and change and build

243
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,800
how we think, right? So when we think
about what we didn't learn in school we

244
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,270
didn't learn what you have learned from
your human experiences. And when we think

245
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,470
about humans let's think about teams of
humans. So, I am not a manager nor do I

246
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:57,760
play one on TV, so we're gonna talk about
my boss. My boss who is known as Ryan "it

247
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,890
may not be a security boundary but that
doesn't mean it has to suck" Kivett. So

248
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:07,570
Ryan's background is Windows internals
and security in the operating system.

249
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:12,689
He's a hardcore debugger. He's a hardcore
dev, who majored in business in college.

250
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,080
So another person with an interesting
path. And his prior experience at

251
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,970
Microsoft was literally, he decided he
wanted to own UAC for a while, User

252
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,860
Account Control that thing with all the
bypasses? Ryan's work caused it to be an

253
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,949
RS5 all of those bypasses went away.
Shh. So most of the user-mode comm stuff

254
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,640
he took away, right? So this is his
background. His background when he has

255
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,570
made it to be a principal level manager
at Microsoft is in deep kernel nerd

256
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,010
stuff. But then, we needed to form a team.
And we needed to form a team called

257
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,070
Windows Defender Threat Intelligence.
There are multiple threat intelligence

258
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,909
teams at Microsoft. There are multiple
red teams. There are multiple blue teams.

259
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,630
We all have our own role. With Windows Defender Threat Intelligence we had to

260
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,800
fit into a niche that was different and
we had to think differently than other

261
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,090
people because we track both commodity
and targeted threats and we do it

262
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,169
through behaviors versus through other
ways that other people track them. We

263
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:13,420
track what is bad happening and then we
worry about who was doing it, right? So we

264
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,750
had to think differently. So Ryan's a
very smart person when it comes to

265
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,780
building teams of humans because what he
did is he got somebody with a

266
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,710
traditional military sig intelligence
background, he got somebody from a

267
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,370
traditional AV background, he got
somebody who does a lot of dark web

268
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:34,360
research and he got me. So in building
this team, with the IR professional

269
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,050
vampire on the end, we could have had a
lot of risks there because a lot of

270
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,330
times when you bring people from
different backgrounds with different

271
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:45,429
ideas you can build silos. Because you
may dig your heels into the ground and

272
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:50,050
you may think this is the right way to
do it. I have been doing this for two

273
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:55,540
decades. This is the right way to do it.
But that doesn't have to be that way,

274
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,830
because you can be a good teammate not
by protecting your contributions but by

275
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,629
scaling your contributions you can make
other people know what you know and you

276
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,140
can make them work together. So in the
case of our team we have all of these

277
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,110
people from diverse backgrounds and I
mean diverse backgrounds in several

278
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,040
different ways there and what we did is
we sort of all merged and we formed a

279
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,389
hive mind. Because if you want to level
up and you want to move behind a

280
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,620
quarter-circle punch, that's a street
fighter joke, you have to learn new

281
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:29,500
skills and you learn new skills from new
people and new experiences. And that

282
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,420
brings us to change, because change is
really really scary for a lot of people.

283
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,760
And when you build new security people
they may be experiencing change. You may

284
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,330
be taking them out of an economic
situation that there

285
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,659
comfortable with. Their life may have
been bad and you're giving them new

286
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,870
things. They may suffer from what is
known in the security industry as

287
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:54,030
impostor syndrome and that may actually
affect their ability to do things, but

288
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,690
change is big for all of us as an
industry too, because when we talk about

289
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,170
things like scaling and building
diversity and things like that change

290
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,230
means putting our money where our mouth
is and actually going out and finding

291
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,790
new people. Because new people with those
new ideas, they typically may not be

292
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:12,450
coming from your top shelf universities.
They may not be coming from computer

293
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,240
science backgrounds and they may not be
coming from the normal places that you

294
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,930
recruited everyone else on your team.
Change is scary. If we want to have new

295
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:24,060
ideas though, we have to go find new
people. Did you know that OCX files are

296
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:31,440
PE files too? [ Audience Laughter ]
OCX files are like ActiveX
controls and you can use them to execute

297
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,800
code. And the interesting thing about an
OCX file is you can load it in Microsoft

298
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:42,720
Office as well as browsers. OK, so what do
we do? [ Audience Laughter ] 
Jessica, you've given me like your

299
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,620
life story and someone else's life story
and you've kind of made me depressed and

300
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,909
whatever. So how do we build security
people? How do we do something besides

301
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,870
just handing them a collection of tools
and leading them to confusion? Because on

302
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,530
the internet right now you can literally
learn almost everything you would need

303
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:03,210
to be a great security person. Which
things do you start with? What do you

304
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,570
learn? How do you know what type of
security person you want to be? Did you

305
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,830
know that lawyers are security people? At
Microsoft we have an entire division of

306
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:15,810
like 500 lawyers that are also like
software engineers and help us do botnet

307
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,790
takedowns and everything else like that.
Politicians can be security people, right?

308
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,580
Human resource managers can be security
people like there's a lot of different

309
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,240
ways to be a security person besides
being a reverse engineer or a malware

310
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,900
analyst. You don't have to be a red
teamer. You don't have to do anything

311
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,500
like that, there's a lot of different
ways to success. We have all the tools

312
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,200
available to us for free so people can
come from less enabled backgrounds and

313
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,380
they can learn this stuff, but literally
how do you make sense of it it's like

314
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,270
IKEA.
It's like putting together flat pack

315
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,790
furniture. It's really confusing so how
do we make success a repeatable path? How

316
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,820
do we make it something where somebody
doesn't have to spend 20 years of their

317
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,629
life wondering if they're going to
become a dancer or a

318
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,880
forensic pathologists or doing masonry
repair. You can help, because you can do

319
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,130
influence without power. you do not have
to be a manager a director a CIO or

320
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:10,410
whatever at your organization to help
start the change. You have the power,

321
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,280
because what you can do is you can
impact people and you can help to change

322
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,860
stuff just by yourself. Little actions
that you take can enable other people to

323
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,429
become security people and you can help
to build these sort of road maps to our

324
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,510
"choose-your-own-adventure security way".
So if we're gonna continue to use video

325
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:33,220
game metaphors let's talk about
single-player. So, what can you do just by

326
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,940
yourself to help build security people?
Well the first thing that you can do is

327
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,640
you can document what you know, right?
Amanda, malwareunicorn,

328
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,630
is amazing at this. She's
documented reverse engineering 101 and

329
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,950
I've used it to train a lot of different
people. This is cool, right? It may not

330
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,140
seem like rocket surgery reverse
engineering,

331
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,710
even though Amanda's 100% capable of
that. It may have seemed obvious to

332
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,060
people who are reverse engineers, like
why are we documenting this? It has, in

333
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,480
fact, changed multiple people's lives.
I've heard of people getting jobs

334
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,650
because they started with Amanda's
training. So what do you know? What do you

335
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,430
know? It doesn't matter if it's
duplicated already on the internet. Your

336
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:14,350
style of presenting it and your personal
experiences in talking about it may be

337
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,610
what makes the difference to someone. I
know a lot about Kerberos as it relates

338
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:25,149
to making Macs and Red Hat Linux work in
an Active Directory realms. Someone finds

339
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,110
that useful. Another person might find
Kerberos useful purely from an Active

340
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,909
Directory perspective, right? We tell it
from your story. Tell what you know from

341
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:39,370
your story. Document it so that other
peoples know it. Even if you're new at it.

342
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,000
So this is actually Michael and Justin's
blog, where they are actually documenting

343
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,270
their processes of building an attack
framework so that they can actually see

344
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:51,010
what the defense would look like. Because
their current job allows them to see,

345
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,480
well what went wrong. You know we get a
lot of Defender telemetry of what went

346
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,390
wrong and they're very good at picking
through it, but they don't actually get

347
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,350
to see the attack side. So they said, "what
what about, in our spare time, if we built

348
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,010
an attack framework so we could kind of
replicate it and see what signals we

349
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,650
might be missing?" and I was like what's
spare time? [ Audience Laughter ]

350
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,380
But this is what they're doing they are
literally like, they were working until

351
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,110
midnight last night working on making
this so that they could actually

352
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,040
replicate what was going on.
You have impact and you have the

353
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,030
capability to document something. This is
not world-changing knowledge. They do

354
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,480
talk about things that I've already
blogged about, that other people have

355
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,390
already blogged about, but it's a
different perspective because it's the

356
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,990
perspective of somebody who's looking at
it from fresh eyes. So in single-player

357
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:39,030
mode you can document things. You can
make things better and you can find gaps

358
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:44,220
an existing documentation. Who's heard of
logon type 9? Logon type 9 in windows

359
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,630
means that you're invisible that's my
present to you. My finding of a gap in

360
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,290
documentation is because there's nothing
like being up at 3:00 a.m. at an

361
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,290
incident response and googling for
something and having your own name come

362
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,780
up. And you're like, "No, she doesn't know."
[ Audience Laughter ]

363
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,910
You can also cause trouble.
So in single-player mode you can break

364
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,230
stuff before the bad people do. So Will built Empire, Jared Haight built PSAttack,

365
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:17,040
BloodHound built by Andy and Rohan.
This is stuff where I actually defend

366
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,180
things and build antivirus signatures.
And I love every one of those people.

367
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,830
Because this type of work that you do as
you cause trouble and break things

368
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,000
before other people do, usually when we
go back and look someone has already

369
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,960
been doing it, right? So if you want to
break things you can still help fix

370
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,550
things and you can find niches and gaps
that didn't exist because bloodhound

371
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,389
didn't really exist before they made
that tool. There were capabilities and

372
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,290
there were enterprise grade software, but
the typical normal person, like those

373
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,780
people that sit in the audience of
security conferences,

374
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,500
did not know that you could query the
membership with a local administrators

375
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:59,160
group on any Windows computer as a non-admin user. By the way, if you enable the

376
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,390
Windows Firewall, that doesn't work
anymore.

377
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,900
So, you can do things from that
perspective too. Bring what you have an

378
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,980
experience of looking at broken things
or your ideas about how you might break

379
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,660
it. When we think about like IT
professionals, IT professionals do not

380
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,770
get enough credit. People talk about like
let's get new people into code. Let's

381
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:24,870
have coding boot camps. Yes, woo,
coding. Coding is cool. I learned coding I

382
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,280
did do computer science in school, but
you know who's really valuable too? The

383
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,020
person who manages Group Policy, and
System Center, and Ansible. Because you

384
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,530
know what a really great way is to attack a network

385
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:42,660
and have nobody detect you? Embed
yourself in the Ansible system, right? So

386
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,380
like you can bring a perspective, even if
you want to cause trouble and break

387
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,900
things, from an IT perspective of how you
would remain undetected on a network. So

388
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,470
you can come from that perspective.
Single-player mode again. Embrace

389
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:01,320
curiosity. Just mess around with stuff.
Opening up ProcMon and watching what

390
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,450
queries a system, you will sometimes find
these things called elevation of

391
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,830
privilege. You will find literal 0day in
Windows if you know what you're doing,

392
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:16,470
right? Be curious. Learn how stuff is
supposed to work. You can do TCP dumps.

393
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,430
You can, you don't even need to worry
about having Wireshark, like fire up ye

394
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:24,450
olde Linux server and, you know, look what
normal traffic looks like, right? Because

395
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,510
MYSQL should not be doing some of
the stuff that you see it doing on the

396
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:32,940
network. And understand the fundamentals,
right? so this type of thing where people

397
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,050
now have all these tools to enable them
going forward, I kind of worry about

398
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:41,760
BloodHound in some ways, because
BloodHound is so awesome and it is so

399
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,260
cool I'm afraid people are gonna forget
exactly why it works. And they're

400
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,820
therefore going to not understand how to
break it, right? So understand the

401
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,270
fundamentals, and then share the
fundamentals because as we have these

402
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,900
new security people coming on and
they're taking pen test courses and

403
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,600
they're taking college courses and
they're exposed to wonderful things like

404
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,590
Metasploit and PowerShell Empire, I
actually interviewed someone the other

405
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,939
day who is a fantastic hacker and has
won multiple CTFs. They're very young so

406
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,970
they were very surprised when I told
them they didn't actually need

407
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,240
PowerShell Empire to create a reverse
shell and you can do it natively with a

408
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,180
batch file. And they said what's a batch
file, so 
[ Audience Laughter ]

409
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:25,440
and I said something that won't get
detected by AV, and they loved me again

410
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,090
so it was okay. So understand your
fundamentals and share those with people.

411
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:34,080
Because the fundamentals that you
learned may still be around, but people

412
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,970
may have forgotten about them, right? This
is why IQY files which is like this

413
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,020
weird legacy thing inside of Excel
really, really did wonders for the

414
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,940
Necur's Botnet a couple of weeks ago,
because everyone forgot they existed.

415
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,570
You can speak of things speaking of
things it's cool, because as you speak at

416
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,389
things, be brave your voice matters. A lot of

417
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,990
times new people think, "I don't have
anything to say there". You know what I

418
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:02,940
love? A talk by a new person about all of
the things they screwed up as a new

419
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:08,070
person on their way to becoming a good
person, right? I have just revealed a lot

420
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:12,330
of things I failed at. I try to be
transparent as I like do labs and I do

421
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,290
like documentation of, this is hard, I
screwed this up. I don't know why this

422
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,820
works. If you want to give a talk at any
conference that I'm on the panel of or

423
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,950
the content advisory board on your new
perspective? Kwas, a red teamer, who gave

424
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,700
her talk at blue hat that I recruited
her to do because it was baby's first

425
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,240
keylogger, It was literally the first
keylogger she wrote. And other people

426
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,430
were like who cares and I'm like because
it's about her journey. Oh, and by the way,

427
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:46,260
her keylogger bypasses all the AVs on
virustotal. So, you, you can bring a new

428
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,100
perspective and it's actually
interesting. So think that your voice

429
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,270
matters and this can be your
single-player mode of therein. But you also,

430
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,889
don't completely go solo, do a kind of a
team match. Because if you work with

431
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:03,030
others on your talk, whether new or old,
this is where you get new perspectives.

432
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,840
Some of the best talks that I've given
have been where I said to somebody and

433
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,990
said "hey you want to give a talk with me?"
And Gerald Steere and I did

434
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,560
BSides Seattle last year, just simply
because we wanted to. Thanks BSides Seattle.

435
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,669
And we just said like well okay we want
to do a talk on red teaming you wish you

436
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,300
were doing. And that was a really, really
fun talk that totally wasn't recorded so

437
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:26,460
you're never gonna see it. But we, we
dropped though 0day, one or two. Um, but as you

438
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,300
work with people you're gonna make your
talk better and you're going to network

439
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,550
with other people. And you're going to
show

440
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,090
something really, really important as
we're trying to build security people.

441
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:40,679
You're going to show that we are not
single pillars of truth we are a

442
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,540
collaborative organization. Security
people don't really have a reputation

443
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,710
for being team players. We have a
reputation for dropping zero days on

444
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:53,100
Twitter, and doing bad things, and all
stuff like that. We do not have a

445
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,209
reputation for being a kumbaya come
together, work together team. If you stand

446
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,020
on stage with another person, especially
if that person is a red teamer and

447
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,740
you're a blue teamer, or if that person
works at another company than you, I've

448
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,900
presented with our competitors before
that's fun. You can show that what really

449
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,950
matters is protecting people. That's what
security people are here to do we're

450
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,760
here to protect people, right? So don't
worry about egos, check them at the door.

451
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,870
Stand on stage with somebody who's
different than you, or don't speak at

452
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:26,550
things. This is not a requirement. This is
not a requirement. Like I am super

453
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,379
thrilled that I actually got coerced
into having speaking on my resume. I

454
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,310
never ever ever ever wanted to do it. I
did a presentation for Microsoft because

455
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,419
the other guy was sick that presentation
got a hundred and seventy-five thousand

456
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:44,730
page views in 24 hours so there was no
turning back. You don't have to do this.

457
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:50,340
You can be impactful in the community in
ways that allow you to be shy and scared

458
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,050
of people, right? You don't have to do
this, but you can still work with people

459
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:59,399
on one-to-one smaller scale type of
things there's ways to be connected. So

460
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,270
let's talk about team play, right?
Because connecting is a big part of why

461
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,379
I'm standing here trying to make eye
contact with as many of you as possible.

462
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,440
So what can you do if you're trying to
be a team player? If you're trying to

463
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,010
actually work with others to build
security peoples? Well what you can do is

464
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:18,300
you can give someone a chance, right? We
sometimes have the capability to sponsor

465
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,630
other people to do cool things. I
sponsored somebody to go to DerbyCon

466
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:26,550
training. It was something that I was
able to do, so I did it, right? So this

467
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,130
person is actually a very good reverse
engineer who is having a hard time

468
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:32,940
getting people to give her an
opportunity because she's so junior. She

469
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,560
goes to job interviews. She's learning
she's new she's very young and people

470
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,790
say "well you're just too junior for this
role". So this is the problem of someone

471
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,900
who is super smart and really studies
because I sent her to a training and I

472
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,549
made
do homework to prove that she'd been

473
00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:55,290
there. I'm a cruel mistress, sorry.
They're not giving her opportunities,

474
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:59,040
right? So this is where we have another
case of a person who is smart he's not

475
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,490
getting opportunity. So give somebody a
chance give them something they can put

476
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,879
on their resume. It doesn't have to be
DerbyCon training. It doesn't

477
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,450
have to be super expensive, right? But you
can work with somebody to like, let's say

478
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:13,799
publish an app, right? You could do an
Android app, you could do, you know help

479
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:17,940
them get a web page a blog type of thing
out there. Something on github. If you

480
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,000
give someone a chance, then they have
something that they can reference that

481
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,460
says, "I'm not a new person, this is what
I've done". So you can help. You can also

482
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:31,109
be available. So all you have to do
sometimes is just be there for people. So

483
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:34,680
the BloodHound gang people are really
really cool because what they do is they

484
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,669
actually are just available for anybody
to come in and talk to them. So find a

485
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,559
group like this. Be available. Make road maps. You can actually make your own road

486
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:50,549
map for somebody. Who knows how to become
a Windows forensics person. I do and I

487
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:54,990
actually shared that road map on my
blog somewhere. But you can think about

488
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:59,759
like well I am a reverse engineer. I am a
Linux admin how did I get here? Come up

489
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,339
with your training plan. Like start with
this book, then you're skilled enough to

490
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:05,430
go to this book, this one, this one, this
one. And then publish it. Publish it

491
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:09,808
somewhere where somebody can see.
Mind-meld. Go out of your way to partner

492
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:13,440
with people who think differently than
you. Go out of your way to sit in the

493
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,930
room with an iOS jailbreaker if you're a
Windows person. I have learned so much. Go

494
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:23,520
out of your way to find the people who
are different and maybe even against you.

495
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,099
Some of my favorite people that I've
learned from are the people who are

496
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:29,309
actually part of the Xbox Underground.
The group that was actually hacking

497
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:34,349
Microsoft, that's cool.
You can teach. So you can actually teach

498
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:37,950
things so when Jared and Sean gave this
course on modern windows attack and

499
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,098
defense, I thought this was so cool this
was so fresh this was so innovative,

500
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:44,040
because they weren't just teaching a
defense course. They were showing you

501
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,750
practically how these things apply. So if
you want to build a security people you

502
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,980
can show them how this stuff applies in
the real world. Because it can get really,

503
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,760
really, like I'm losing hope and I'm gonna
go do something else if you don't

504
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,210
understand that you're actually gonna
have impact. And when you do teach, go

505
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,440
teach in unexpected places.
Community colleges, high schools, homeless

506
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,559
shelters. Did you know that a lot of the
homeless people on the west coast

507
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,200
like we're accepted to Stanford before
their parents kicked him out for one

508
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,210
reason or another
I learned that when I moved to Seattle.

509
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,290
like a lot of the people that are in the
youth shelters in Seattle have really

510
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,890
good educational backgrounds.
They're just lacking opportunities. So

511
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:23,308
there's a lot of places that you could
go teach where you could do a lot of

512
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:27,599
unexpected impact to somebody's life. Now there's sponsorship and there's mentorship,

513
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,299
and these are actually two different
things and a guy named John Rodriguez

514
00:37:30,299 --> 00:37:33,270
taught me that in my first year at
Microsoft. A lot of people ask for

515
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:36,660
mentorship. Mentorship is like where
you're actually teaching them how to do

516
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,500
something, but there's also just
sponsorship. Everyone that I showed you

517
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,490
in this deck today just got sponsorship
from me, because what I did is I gave

518
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:48,089
them opportunities I gave them
visibilities. What you can do is you can

519
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:51,690
quite simply just take someone you know
is smart and put them in the room with

520
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,799
another smart person. Like, oh you're
building a security app, but you're not

521
00:37:55,799 --> 00:38:01,530
really good at c-sharp? I know someone
who is. That's sponsorship. Okay, so what if

522
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,880
you want to do massively multiplayer
mode building of security people? Well

523
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,109
security is not a global constant.
Did you know that like what you might

524
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:14,970
consider to be a security thing here,
like, whether that be living to the

525
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,089
letter of the law or a security setting
might not actually work on another

526
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:21,720
country? There are certain group policy
settings and windows that you can set

527
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,049
that will actually violate the laws of
other countries. Because they're not

528
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:29,160
allowed to have like an enforced
language so if you set the home page to

529
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,328
Google in English you've actually broken
the law. Cool.

530
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:39,059
I learned that. But you need to learn
this by like understanding also your

531
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:41,910
adversaries, because a lot of times in
our news coverage nowadays it's like,

532
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:47,220
they're bad, they're bad, they're bad. Yeah,
and they think we're bad, so you know

533
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,578
security is not a global constant. Think
about it from like learning the

534
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,119
perspectives of other cultures. There's
even things like, as you learned that

535
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:57,329
security is not a global constant, like
when you look at an event log the colors

536
00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:01,079
red don't necessarily mean the same
thing in every culture like in a Western

537
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,510
mindset that means error. In other
countries it means, I won!

00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,559
movement, right? So join organizations.
Whether that be you know an established

539
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,740
organization that's actually mentoring.
There's the rural tech fund. The rural

540
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,220
tech fund actually does a lot of work
for donating to small schools and gets

541
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,970
some tech things. You can change
companies from the inside. You can help

542
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,450
to actually change how a company is
built and how it is by recruiting,

543
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:28,259
recruiting, recruiting, right? And then you
need to push back and actually fight for

544
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,750
your recruits.
Because if you hear something like this

545
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,869
person is too junior or this person
isn't good enough, well then you make it

546
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:38,069
so they aren't. And then you get them
back in, right? You have to actually be

547
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:41,670
able to do this type of stuff to get the
global change. Or you can start something.

548
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:46,319
There are opportunities to create small
scale organizations that will be able to

549
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:50,790
change people's lives. If you want to
create your own using LattePanda small

550
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:55,140
computer devices to go teach people how
to code and do packet captures, that

551
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,740
would be a relatively small investment
you would be able to help 20 or 30

552
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,009
people and they would now know a whole
different set of skills that they didn't

553
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,940
know. So, if there isn't an organization
that you like, it's really easy to start

554
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,270
one. You don't even have to bother with
the whole nonprofit thing. But perhaps

555
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:13,349
most importantly, escape the echo chamber.
If you look at security Twitter it's a

556
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:16,190
whole lot of people talking to each
other about things they already know.

557
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,880
Okay, but what you want to do is you want
to talk to people who don't know it and

558
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,690
you want to talk to people to get those
different perspectives. If you talk to

559
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:29,369
someone who actually uses software they
will explain to you exactly why all

560
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:33,720
those vulnerabilities are there.
90% of what I know about comm hijacking

561
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,689
comes because I worked at a law firm
where all of the Outlook plugins

562
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:42,779
required comm hijacking stuff. So you
will actually learn why bad stuff exists

563
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:46,380
and why it's hard to fix. You will also
be able to connect with people who can

564
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:50,160
help you fix it. Because if you escape
the echo chamber and you actually talk

565
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,089
to lawyers and politicians and
C levels, who aren't technical

566
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:58,049
C levels, they will be able to help you
enable and enact your change. If you want

567
00:40:58,049 --> 00:41:01,440
to enable and enact change by changing
the face of the youth and what they

568
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,029
learn? If you connect with a non tech
savvy teacher at an elementary school,

569
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:09,809
you have now escaped the echo chamber
and you understand why it's difficult.

570
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:14,339
Talk to people who don't find what you
do easy for a lot of us this probably

571
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,369
came very easy to us we were probably
teenagers we sat down in front of a

572
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:20,170
computer and said
I got this. For some people it doesn't

573
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:24,220
work like that. Go find people who it
doesn't come easy to. And what you'll

574
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:28,439
find is you're capable of thinking
outside of the box then. This is cute, huh?

575
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,349
I'm just checking to see if you're paying
attention. So if you can think outside of

576
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:36,130
the box that will allow you to innovate
and change and also help to support

577
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,950
those people, but the most important
thing you have to remember is you have

578
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,890
to remember empathy, right?
This is empathy as we're designing

579
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:45,098
security systems and as we're building
the security people that we're working

580
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:49,630
with. A lot of us made it to the way that
we made it through those paths where we

581
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:52,750
might have struggled and we might have
forgotten what it's like. We might have

582
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:57,520
forgotten what it's like to not know
what eventid 1102 is, or that rdpclip.exe

583
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,609
starts when somebody logs in
even if you don't have it a login type

584
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:05,109
10. You need to be able to understand the
people you're working with and you need

585
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:08,200
to be able to understand their
motivations for why they're doing it. And

586
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,680
that's gonna help you actually build
these networks and be able to enforce

587
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,740
those people. And you have to also
remember that failure is always an

588
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,848
option and failure isn't a bad thing.
Because if you try really hard at

589
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:23,320
something, you learned something. If you
fail at something, you absolutely took

590
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,750
away everything that you learned at it.
"Chase dragons" in the words of Devon Kerr.

591
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:32,200
Because as you chase that dragon you're
going to either get a stronger sword arm

592
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,919
or whatever the metaphorical thing would
be. I do a lot of stuff that you never

593
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,359
see and I suck at it.
And that's ok, because I keep trying at

594
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:43,779
it and I learn from it. Whether that be
stupid things like today, where I came

595
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:47,650
out and gave a 100% non-technical talk
and really didn't feel comfortable doing

596
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,940
it. If I failed it doesn't matter because
I learned something and that's what we

597
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,640
need to remember as we're teaching
people and as we're building our new

598
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,900
security people. To teach them that it's
ok to fail and that they didn't actually

599
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:03,369
ruin their lives and they can continue.
Did you know that dot MUI files are PE

600
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:09,010
files too? [ Audience Laughter ] 
So these are localization
files and you can actually side load

601
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,345
with these too. It's really, really cool.
Thank you for coming.

602
00:43:13,345 --> 00:43:23,700
