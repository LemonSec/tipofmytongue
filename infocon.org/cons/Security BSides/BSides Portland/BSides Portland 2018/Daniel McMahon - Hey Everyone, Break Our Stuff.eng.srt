1
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:20,640
thank you for being here my name is

2
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:25,049
Daniel McMahon I am also known as

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,430
mcmayhem I do work at New Relic on the

4
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,450
product security team I'm an

5
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:33,780
applications security engineer this is

6
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:37,530
my third besides Portland so my first

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,600
time talking happy to be here just so

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,000
you know thank you I am a terrible

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,180
socializer so if you have any questions

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,220
afterward please come up to me and throw

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,450
something at me or yell at me because

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,989
I'll probably be sulking in a corner

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,620
somewhere I'll be one of the hundred of

14
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,620
us that are doing that

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,430
so I mentioned New Relic why does that

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,920
matter

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,910
it's not a bitter pitch I don't care who

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,410
you use what you use but we are a pretty

19
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:12,830
large SAS company we're kind of unique

20
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:16,530
too we're not we're not Microsoft's eyes

21
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,960
but we're also not a new startup we're

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,720
not one product to manage we have a

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,059
pretty large surface area numerous

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,950
products that all do very different

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,660
things that operate on very different

26
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,819
parts of the stack applications servers

27
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:36,929
mobile deployed applications JavaScript

28
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:38,220
ring and browsers server software that

29
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:40,410
is sending data to us all these things

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,619
collect data and sent it to our our

31
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:46,530
back-end software so the threat

32
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,630
landscape for us is is gigantic we have

33
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,750
all of our back-end services we need to

34
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,958
maintain we have to worry about our code

35
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,459
running on our customers devices we have

36
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,420
to worry about our code running on our

37
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:06,539
customers customers devices so twice to

38
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:08,710
say we take security seriously it's not

39
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:11,270
funny it's true

40
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:15,200
we have multiple teams at the company

41
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,850
who think about security constantly we

42
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,500
have our operations team who's dealing

43
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,750
with the the actual physical

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,870
infrastructure the data running over the

45
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,400
wire our servers patches we have a

46
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,170
compliance team who's talking to our

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,440
customers constantly figuring out what

48
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,850
things they need for us to build out and

49
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,810
then of course there's my team product

50
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:37,790
security who is looking at code we're

51
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,210
doing code reviews every day we are

52
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,370
meeting with teams constantly basically

53
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,100
just trying to get a handle on the

54
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,740
50-plus teams and growing that we have

55
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,049
the company but it's tough there's only

56
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,210
a few of us on any of those teams

57
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,940
there's not that many people not that

58
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:58,430
many eyes so everything that we can do

59
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:02,510
to increase the information coming in to

60
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:04,790
us is helpful we try really hard

61
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,250
internally within the company to build

62
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,530
out a culture of security sure I get

63
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,420
advocates from other teams teams that

64
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,720
aren't necessarily teams with security

65
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,760
in their name engineers salespeople our

66
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,109
support teams anybody who we can get

67
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,670
thinking about security is helpful to us

68
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,140
so the point is we were stronger with

69
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,640
more people we don't have that many

70
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,600
people dedicated to security for the

71
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,390
more people we have thinking about it

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,859
these are our job is but even with all

73
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:37,489
the work that we do internally that's

74
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:41,120
that's not always enough so that brings

75
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,709
us to coordinator disclosure Cortney

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,959
disclosure is kind of a fancy name for

77
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:46,720
for bug bounties but that takes a lot of

78
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,930
different forms

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,959
who here has some way for people to to

80
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:59,000
submit bugs to your company that's

81
00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:01,940
awesome I know you do so it could just

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,890
be an email address we call that a

83
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,780
vulnerability disclosure program some

84
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:08,059
way just for people to send something to

85
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,340
you if somebody comes across a bug on

86
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,330
your site accidentally or intentionally

87
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,630
they want a way to be able just tell you

88
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:17,530
about it you may pay money you may not

89
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,909
you may use a service like hacker one

90
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,919
doesn't matter you have a way for people

91
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,630
to actually submit stuff to you

92
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,870
that just is that it's a safe way for

93
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,820
researchers to disclose stuff to you

94
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:33,440
without a fear of reprisal that's the

95
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:36,409
big thing so we have had a bug bounty

96
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,650
program for about two and a half years

97
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:44,270
now almost three years at first we had a

98
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:46,070
completely private program that we paid

99
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,900
money out to well we had a public

100
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,490
program we added a private program but

101
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,469
we started paying cash - and now we have

102
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,710
a completely public program that we pay

103
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,970
cash - so we've been doing this for a

104
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,960
while and we've had a lot of reports

105
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,790
come in we've dealt with a lot of

106
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:05,239
different researchers from all over the

107
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:09,080
world so benefits wise it is a humongous

108
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:12,230
force multiplier for small teams we do

109
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,900
assessments we have security researchers

110
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:17,090
from big firms that we trust come and

111
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,940
poke at our products we'll give them our

112
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,140
source code sometimes we'll let them

113
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,110
we'll let them do everything they can to

114
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,469
do pen tests a specific product but

115
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,940
assessments can only catch so much stuff

116
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,730
we've been around for a decade now our

117
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:34,250
products are very mature so repeat

118
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:37,250
assessments don't always find anything

119
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,830
new people kind of get stuck in the same

120
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,010
thought processes a lot even trying to

121
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,870
rotate vendors around which we do

122
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:48,320
eventually they've ran their run books

123
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:51,470
they've done what they know but the

124
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,890
really unique thing is you get a

125
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,880
completely different perspective from

126
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,010
random people on the internet who are

127
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,270
submitting stuff to you these aren't

128
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,650
always people who are professionally

129
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,080
involved in security these aren't always

130
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,099
people have any kind of formal training

131
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,349
they're gonna be doing things that you

132
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:11,570
haven't even heard of before totally

133
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:13,400
crazy new stuff so you can do your red

134
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,590
teaming you could have pen testers come

135
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,060
in you can do all the things that you do

136
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,030
normally and those are all really really

137
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,290
great but at the end of the day you only

138
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,780
have so much budget you only have so

139
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,070
much time you only have so many people

140
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,039
so anything that you can do to add

141
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:32,200
additional eyes especially these totally

142
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,200
unique new people is a super big benefit

143
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,789
there are risks

144
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,170
who here has considered something like

145
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:47,240
this and didn't go through with it

146
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:50,490
a couple people so that's pretty common

147
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,490
it's kind of terrifying to just have

148
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,360
random people come and poke your stuff

149
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:58,260
legal needs to be involved

150
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,090
there's PR risk potentially a big thing

151
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,849
for us especially with a coordinated

152
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,140
disclosure program is most or all of

153
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,780
things that are being submitted to you

154
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,580
are eventually going to be public so you

155
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,159
have to worry about your what what does

156
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,890
your team say in a response all of their

157
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,530
responses are gonna be public the actual

158
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:19,229
ways you're working through a problem is

159
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:21,479
gonna be public it's also a lot of work

160
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,830
for your team every single thing that

161
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,590
comes in has to be reviewed by somebody

162
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:31,020
that's a lot of work to to triage and to

163
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:33,260
decide where it applies but that's why

164
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,490
I'm here I want to convince you that

165
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:39,140
even with all the risks even with all

166
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,280
the difficulties it is totally worth it

167
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,830
initially when I was planning this talk

168
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,250
I really wanted to target risk-averse

169
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,859
companies there's a lot out there

170
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,780
healthcare governments all these all

171
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,490
these industries where there's a lot of

172
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,780
red tape anyway and a lot of things to

173
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,850
worry about that can make you not

174
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,440
compliant or put you or your customers

175
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,960
at risk

176
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,340
I actually saw some folks in the

177
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,820
automotive industry talking last year

178
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,859
and seeing seeing how much they they

179
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,020
want to be able to do stuff but they're

180
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,590
tied back by all these other all these

181
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:16,650
other factors so my goal today is to

182
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:19,200
show you that even with all that it's a

183
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,849
net benefit it's worth doing and it will

184
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:27,419
be a drastic improvement for your team

185
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:28,950
so here's the big thing no matter what

186
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,960
you're doing no matter who you are no

187
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:35,059
matter what industry you are in you're

188
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,710
already being hacked the big thing is

189
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:40,949
without a program you're never going to

190
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:42,750
hear about it if you have a program good

191
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,820
people aren't going to avoid you they're

192
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,190
going to come and tell you

193
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,980
so really you're not losing anything by

194
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,410
opening up you're losing all the good

195
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,640
people skipping your program being

196
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,439
afraid that something's gonna come back

197
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,890
and bite them if they submit something

198
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,480
to you and then you're also hopefully

199
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,100
gonna defer some of the bad people doing

200
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,690
that stuff

201
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,660
somebody might seem actually mentioned a

202
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,850
good point if you're doing something

203
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,010
malicious you want the shortest path to

204
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,960
catch you can get you're not always

205
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,890
paying money even with a program like

206
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,270
hacker when you're not always paying

207
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:20,040
money but reputations big and even small

208
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,800
amounts of money are a whole lot easier

209
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,560
for people to want to get submit to you

210
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,449
and get then then trying to go through

211
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:34,319
some kind of black market way or share

212
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:36,420
it with friends so what should you

213
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,610
expect if you decide to open one of

214
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,160
these up whether it be an actual bug

215
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,350
bounty program or just an email or any

216
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,390
way for people to submit to you well

217
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:49,650
you're gonna get some absolutely

218
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:53,640
terrible reports we have seen we have

219
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,510
seen things all across the board it

220
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,550
might be people who just can't

221
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,980
communicate well whether that's a

222
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:02,130
language barrier or people who are new

223
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,410
to the industry or people who are just

224
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,730
really bad at putting their thoughts

225
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,959
down on paper even if they have a good

226
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:12,000
finding we also have noticed swarms of

227
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,680
reports similar reports coming in at the

228
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,200
same time which is a really strange

229
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,390
thing but often you'll see the same

230
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,230
class of report come in simultaneously

231
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,910
so there can be a lot of noise but at

232
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,160
the same time you can get some really

233
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:29,160
really amazing stuff

234
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,050
things that you your team may not have

235
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,670
ever even heard of before even if you

236
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,839
keep up with the news even if you are

237
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:39,240
super security conscious you learn a lot

238
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,040
by seeing the types of reports you get

239
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:47,670
and the methodology that these people

240
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:50,250
use so I want to talk about some

241
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,750
examples that we've seen and this will

242
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:56,670
be kind of the second half of my talk

243
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:58,230
today we over the last two

244
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,199
two-and-a-half years

245
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:05,490
have had close to 200 reports I think

246
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:09,420
that have come in via our program things

247
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:11,130
tackling every part of our stack things

248
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,040
that some we've paid for some we haven't

249
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,630
paid for but all really really great

250
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,040
things that have actually changed how

251
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:25,530
we've thought about our products and how

252
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:30,360
our partisan put together so to start

253
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:32,010
with mentioned we're a SAS company what

254
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:38,970
you may not have realized is that stands

255
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:41,730
for SS RF as a service so what is SS r f

256
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,580
it's server side request forgery it's a

257
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,270
way for somebody to make your server

258
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,120
call up to something that you don't

259
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,079
expect

260
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,540
interestingly we actually do this

261
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,630
intentionally we have multiple products

262
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:58,219
that perform requests for people

263
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:00,780
intentionally what's not intended is

264
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,370
accessing internal stuff we don't want

265
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,670
people hitting or on endpoints and

266
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:11,970
things like that but as we know it's

267
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:13,469
hard so this is an example of one of our

268
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:18,990
tools that reaches out and does these

269
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:21,420
requests you can plug in an endpoint you

270
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,040
can have it do a get or a post request

271
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,270
it'll just reach out and try to hit

272
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,579
something that you wanted to hit and

273
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:29,780
this is super useful if you want to test

274
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,220
monitoring a website things like that

275
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:36,120
interestingly here though on the right

276
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,220
side it's a little bit tough to read but

277
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,270
that's the that's the request they're

278
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,060
trying to make and that's actually an

279
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:45,120
error message that's coming back this

280
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,670
this enterprising individual is trying

281
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,690
to access the Amazon Web Services

282
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:54,569
metadata endpoint thankfully we filtered

283
00:12:51,690 --> 00:13:02,600
that so those are three blocked error

284
00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:06,050
messages but have you ever heard of

285
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,980
zip-tie Oh see me heard of this before

286
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:12,020
good you learned something today

287
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:14,870
so this is a neat little tool what does

288
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:19,310
it mean for for our for a prior example

289
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:22,010
here well this is what it does you take

290
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,079
an IP address you prefix it in front of

291
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,770
zip that I owe and now you have a

292
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,090
resolvable dns name for that IP address

293
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:33,130
anybody can do this with DNS but this is

294
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:33,130
a really quick little way to do it so

295
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:44,030
naturally that breaks every filter that

296
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:46,250
we have in place so the same person took

297
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:49,040
that example typed in zipped at i/o and

298
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,420
then of course they can access the

299
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,870
metadata endpoint because we didn't

300
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,760
filter for that in the end they actually

301
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:59,900
went on to write a proof concept for

302
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,490
this where they were able to completely

303
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,520
download an excellent rate that

304
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:08,240
information using this smarter the the

305
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,620
larger scripted interface to that so

306
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,000
yeah but who would ever think about that

307
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,760
you know that's a totally unique

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,860
situation we had blocked the IP we had

309
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,870
blocked at endpoint never even

310
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,090
considered the possibility that it would

311
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,950
have something like this happen the end

312
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,290
result though is that we improved our

313
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,580
filtering we have a canonical way to

314
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,860
determine where these things are going

315
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,580
now and it improved the company across

316
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:34,330
the board all via a submission we had

317
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,330
through a bug waiting program

318
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:48,559
so similarly we have one to seven point

319
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:49,998
0.01 it's your local machine you tend to

320
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:56,149
have services running on your local

321
00:14:49,999 --> 00:15:00,980
machine did you know that there are

322
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:04,160
other ways to write 27-point open 0.1 we

323
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:10,089
have dot decimal notation with

324
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:14,809
hexadecimal we have octal there's also

325
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:17,779
dot las' decimal notation which as it

326
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:23,209
turns out also ends up breaking all the

327
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:25,910
filters yet another thing that I

328
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:28,309
personally had never considered I've

329
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,110
never even thought of but coming back to

330
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:32,449
having a canonical source to reach out

331
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,990
to improve our product improve the way

332
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:37,819
we do things and kept us safe it's also

333
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,589
really cool to read these and then go

334
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:40,639
back and like use them yourself if you

335
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:42,350
want to go and do some acting on your

336
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:50,899
own because these are our really cool

337
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:53,959
techniques so we had a really neat one

338
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:56,929
come in from albino wax who is one of

339
00:15:53,959 --> 00:16:01,489
the researchers at ports Berger who

340
00:15:56,929 --> 00:16:04,069
makes burp suite he as he does was

341
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,379
messing around a burp suite found what

342
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:09,920
her brain points had kind of a weird

343
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:14,360
rewrite rule and our and our load

344
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:17,449
balancer there this actually resulted in

345
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,100
a pretty awesome conference talk called

346
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:21,109
cracking the winds if you haven't read

347
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,589
it or read this paper or seen the talk I

348
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:27,079
highly recommend looking it up but

349
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:28,999
what's really neat about this is these

350
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:31,489
bug bounty programs aren't just a force

351
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:33,529
multiplier within our company these are

352
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,329
actually industry-wide force multipliers

353
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:38,089
this bug that he found turned out to be

354
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:40,279
an Apache bug which then ended up as a

355
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:42,139
patch against Apache so we fixed it on

356
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:44,329
our side we submitted to Apache Apache

357
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,439
fixed it and everybody got to benefit

358
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:47,769
from something that was submitted to our

359
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,769
program

360
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:01,360
so we are SAS company we're also an IED

361
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:02,830
or as a service company we are a huge

362
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,900
company so we have a lot of products

363
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,010
working together it's tough to make sure

364
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,830
that everything is doing what you expect

365
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,450
it to we have so many products doing so

366
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,040
many different things intermingled in so

367
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,050
many different ways it's a lot to keep

368
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,010
track of and with 10 years of history

369
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,659
it's it's always difficult we also have

370
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,460
a lot of tiny startups within our

371
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,470
company we're kind of a kind of a unique

372
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,060
space that we're not one big company

373
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,950
doing one thing we're a whole bunch of

374
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,290
groups operating pretty independently of

375
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,120
each other and we have some really smart

376
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,409
engineers we have some of the best

377
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,010
engineers in the industry and I don't

378
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,910
say that

379
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:38,890
like sarcastically or blowing smoke up

380
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,870
anybody's ass here but we have some

381
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:48,310
really bright people and even those

382
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:50,620
bright people miss stuff so one of our

383
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:53,620
top contributors is somebody who works

384
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,850
at hacker one mr. John bot araignee over

385
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,840
here

386
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:02,590
he is really good at finding

387
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,250
exceptionally weird stuff he noticed a

388
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,159
while back

389
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:09,010
that he could enumerate the full names

390
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:16,180
of users within our accounts not

391
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:17,830
obfuscated so by adding the right the

392
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,930
right combination of things if we had to

393
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,250
use your account on our already existing

394
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,110
within our system he was able to reveal

395
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:27,030
the full name which is a big deal we

396
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:30,540
don't want that to happen so we fixed it

397
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,540
after we got that submission

398
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:42,340
or so we thought so we had a

399
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,780
resubmission of that same bug we had

400
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:48,549
multiple other resubmissions of that

401
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:49,899
same product I'm I believe I believe you

402
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:54,879
refer to it as the gift that keeps on

403
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:57,100
giving so this was an interesting and

404
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,950
interesting case because these things

405
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,199
kept popping up and what does that tell

406
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:05,169
us it tells us we're not actually fixing

407
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,370
the underlying problem so once again we

408
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:07,990
could have just filed a bug we could

409
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,549
have filed one for each one of these but

410
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,950
what ended up happening is we went and

411
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:13,950
talked to the team we discussed what was

412
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:18,850
actually going on with this situation

413
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:21,370
and we we made an effort to do have a

414
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,510
real correction to the root problem that

415
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,299
actually spanned out to the entire

416
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,620
company something that without having

417
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:29,830
these reports come in we probably

418
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:32,729
wouldn't have even caught let alone had

419
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,730
a comprehensive fix for

420
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,750
oops there we go

421
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:55,399
so synthetics is actually a selenium

422
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:57,049
driver it really is just RC as a service

423
00:19:55,399 --> 00:20:00,250
like we're we're intentionally running

424
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:02,330
people's code within our infrastructure

425
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,250
interestingly this is one of the very

426
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,189
first things that we started paying

427
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:10,639
money for with our bug bunny program

428
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:11,809
there's a little bit of a risk for us it

429
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:17,508
actually got quite a bit of attention

430
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:19,668
when we took a live so we have a sandbox

431
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:21,740
in place within this people can write

432
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:23,720
JavaScript it ends up in this selenium

433
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,129
driver it runs it at those things

434
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,950
like the one I mentioned earlier where

435
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:29,840
he was able to to get the metadata stuff

436
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,519
they write JavaScript it makes requests

437
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,809
it navigates through websites it does a

438
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,320
lot of stuff just like you were using a

439
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:37,809
browser at home but we have a sandbox in

440
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,908
place to keep it from doing nasty stuff

441
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:45,049
the goal - the goal being that they

442
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:47,960
can't run things we don't expect but I

443
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:50,059
say sandbox with quotes because

444
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,049
javascript is really tough to sandbox if

445
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:54,289
you actually want to do anything useful

446
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:55,490
with it there are so many possible

447
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:57,350
things you want to do and so many things

448
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,659
we want to do with our product that

449
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:02,480
trying to sandbox everything and catch

450
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:06,320
everything every side case is basically

451
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:10,850
impossible so we actually ended up

452
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,320
paying out a lot of money so here's this

453
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,850
is an interesting one here's our here's

454
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,899
our sandbox you see do you see a problem

455
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,899
here in the script

456
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,590
so there's our sandbox deactivated we

457
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,450
ended up actually paying out thousands

458
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:38,100
of dollars on sandbox escapes like this

459
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:40,679
this one was painfully obvious by the

460
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,539
time we but it's on we realized like

461
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,950
there's gonna be more and more and more

462
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,299
of these there's every possible way

463
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,549
somebody's gonna be clever and figure

464
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:49,370
out how to get out of a JSA inbox we did

465
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:52,590
the same thing as we did before with the

466
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,908
with the alerts names we wouldn't talk

467
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,408
to the team and we came up with a

468
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:57,630
solution that was actually comprehensive

469
00:21:55,409 --> 00:22:00,750
and would cover all of these different

470
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:02,400
cases not just specific cases in the end

471
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,289
we actually ended up putting apartment

472
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,419
profiles around these so the JavaScript

473
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:09,390
scan sandbox is more of a more of a

474
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:11,909
guideline than anything but we have a

475
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,590
much more robust solution that wouldn't

476
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:16,370
have come about had we not had these

477
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,370
submissions come through

478
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,510
so the final thing that's been really

479
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:32,070
helpful for us is keeping our

480
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:34,080
documentation accurate so our customers

481
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,490
do a lot of things that we didn't

482
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,639
necessarily ever intend our products to

483
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:40,710
have done with them we give people a lot

484
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,820
of power to do things like write their

485
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:46,890
own code embed our api's but we do try

486
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,510
really hard to document all the places

487
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,980
where we're doing anything potentially

488
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,260
weird so when we collect data

489
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,320
we're very specific about specific about

490
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,270
what we collect we do everything we can

491
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,720
not to collect additional data that's a

492
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:02,340
bug our most important thing though is

493
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,050
we just don't want to surprise people we

494
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,189
don't want to surprise people within the

495
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,110
company we don't want to surprise our

496
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,330
customers we want things to be very

497
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:11,939
specific we want people to know what

498
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:19,590
they're getting into so what happens if

499
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:21,900
our documentation is wrong so we have a

500
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,939
concept called restrict accounts and

501
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,920
restricted accounts are accounts that

502
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,600
basically operate like kiosks they're

503
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,910
just read only accounts that a lot of

504
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:34,560
customers use it's not a real security

505
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:36,870
feature it's more of a more of an

506
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,629
account control to help you do some

507
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:41,909
things like kiosk work but we do

508
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:44,390
document it heavily and we want people

509
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:46,620
to use it and a lot of people like it

510
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,620
so same person I mentioned before from

511
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:52,020
hacker one has come up with some super

512
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:57,810
clever techniques for figuring stuff out

513
00:23:52,020 --> 00:24:00,450
with Bert and he came up with a lot of

514
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:02,340
situations where restricted users

515
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:05,730
weren't quite as restricted as we

516
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,350
expected so here we can see the account

517
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,650
license key is pretty important that's

518
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:12,870
how you send it up restricted users

519
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,890
can't see it they can only read what's

520
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,179
already in the account but they

521
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:19,170
shouldn't be sending new data to the

522
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:22,200
account well he found out that if you

523
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:24,210
just go to the right page and go to

524
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:30,660
install it actually just shows for you

525
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:33,270
even if you're a restricted user so by

526
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,420
navigating around by looking for the by

527
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,310
looking for the license key that's there

528
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,020
he was able to find this in a totally

529
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,810
random place that the team didn't catch

530
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,129
that we didn't catch but it did show us

531
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,629
that we were out of compliance with the

532
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,040
documentation we had in place which

533
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:55,100
means customers weren't getting the

534
00:24:46,040 --> 00:25:01,100
experience that they expected so to

535
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:03,290
finish up anybody here who doesn't have

536
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:10,790
some kind of vulnerability disclosure

537
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:13,460
program consider one it has been such a

538
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,990
massive benefit for us compared to all

539
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,860
the other resources that we have to get

540
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:20,570
submissions look at the disclosures that

541
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:24,740
are already out there look at ours at

542
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:26,360
that page look at big companies who have

543
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,850
had a lot of disclosure Shopify is a

544
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:33,020
great example see the kind of stuff that

545
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:35,149
they're finding and engage with the

546
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,180
companies that are already doing it like

547
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:40,460
us come talk to me

548
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:43,730
it is absolutely terrifying as I

549
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,170
mentioned before to have random people

550
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,630
on the internet people you've never met

551
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:50,600
people you might not ever meet that may

552
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,730
not even have credentials may just be an

553
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,270
anonymous username having people like

554
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:58,550
that poking your stuff is scary but it's

555
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,480
already happening if anybody wants to

556
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:06,139
look at your stuff they're already doing

557
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:09,890
it it's just best to know also if you're

558
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:11,570
a hacker come hack our stuff and if

559
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,880
you're a hacker looking for jobs come

560
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:16,090
talk to us because we want these kind of

561
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,720
people that are submitting stuff to us

562
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,720
so thank you

563
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:42,330
do any questions yeah so the question

564
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:45,930
was are there NDA's for submissions to

565
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:48,480
our program or any program we don't have

566
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:52,470
in DA's and a big part of the

567
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,850
methodology is that if it does come into

568
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:59,060
our program it's gonna be public

569
00:26:53,850 --> 00:27:01,590
eventually but there is there's some

570
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:03,210
some guidelines to people submitting

571
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,120
generally who like join a program like

572
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:08,820
hacker one there's a there's some like

573
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,639
kind of bug buddy etiquette I guess like

574
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,590
don't disclose it beforehand we do have

575
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,230
a policy in place that is kind of our

576
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,820
rules of engagement for that the policy

577
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,180
says give us time

578
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,679
don't just disclose it I think a lot of

579
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,660
people operate off of like the Google

580
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,280
methodology where they wait 90 days or

581
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,130
whatever but there is no explicit NDA

582
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,030
it's a it's a lot about reputation if

583
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,290
you're the kind of person who's just

584
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,370
gonna go spam it everywhere we're

585
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,200
probably not gonna want to talk to you

586
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,370
as a researcher and I think a lot of the

587
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,650
researchers don't want to be in a

588
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:41,370
position where they're looked at

589
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,930
negatively like that almost universally

590
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,479
our experiences have been really

591
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,460
positive with people and and even the

592
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,470
ones that weren't super positive there's

593
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:53,130
a mediation process for that there's a

594
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:55,560
lot of there's a lot of kind of

595
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,450
guardrails for a lot of stuff to keep it

596
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,669
from being too painful and it's not that

597
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,440
onerous for somebody to submit they

598
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,450
follow the guidelines they pick the

599
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,620
product or domain or whatever they want

600
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,440
to they want to start pen testing

601
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,610
against if they don't see it there they

602
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,580
can message us and ask why it's not

603
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:13,350
there but generally I think the idea is

604
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,429
you put everything in scope you let

605
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,209
people submit whatever they want and

606
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:20,330
then you kind of take it from there

607
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,330
anybody else

608
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:41,560
yeah I was actually discussing that

609
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,300
earlier I think there are probably

610
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,899
situations where that's gonna be a

611
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,120
problem

612
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,260
you know if you have an iOS jailbreak

613
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,790
bug you're probably gonna take it to

614
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,840
some you-know-who pin or somebody like

615
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:53,170
that and make a million dollars off of

616
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,639
it but for most of our stuff you know if

617
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,460
you find a cross-site scripting bug or a

618
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,420
Caesar for something you could probably

619
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:03,130
make some money off that somehow but you

620
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,540
can make money right away maybe soon as

621
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,950
us

622
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:10,210
you'll gain some reputation you might

623
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:12,070
get invited to other neat stuff I the

624
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:14,680
kind of things that I've seen that we

625
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:16,300
have had come in are pretty intense

626
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,250
we've we've had some really good bugs

627
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,379
come in and those people decided to

628
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,700
submit to us you know these are these

629
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,220
are on par with the assessments that

630
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,870
we've gotten so I think there's probably

631
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,370
situations where that's actually

632
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:33,429
concerned but I think for most people

633
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:35,949
it's not you know Apple Google we're you

634
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:37,870
know nation-state type level things are

635
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,250
coming in but I think for web apps stuff

636
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:41,879
and most of what we're doing with it

637
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,880
hasn't really been a problem

638
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:54,738
yeah and I think there there are some

639
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:59,998
cool controls around that for being

640
00:29:54,739 --> 00:30:01,379
competitive so you can see what

641
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:02,519
everybody else is paying out so if

642
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:05,070
you're a company who's only gonna pay

643
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,230
out say $20 for a cross-site scripting

644
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,450
bug people might not spend their time on

645
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:11,100
you but they can see that ahead of time

646
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,080
so before they submit they can kind of

647
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,939
see like we have we have a table right

648
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,980
now that shows what we pay for different

649
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,440
classes of bugs they can also see all of

650
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,909
our prior reports so it's up to the

651
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,320
hacker if they want to spend their time

652
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:23,399
to even research it in the first place

653
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,428
and if they do that they're probably to

654
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:27,959
submit it to us if we're not competitive

655
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:29,460
we're probably gonna get fewer

656
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,830
submissions and little control for that

657
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:35,029
but the overall ecosystem I think kind

658
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,029
of balances itself out that way

659
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:54,410
yeah we operate the same way so that was

660
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:56,090
if somebody submits a bug it's about the

661
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:58,370
potential not necessarily about what

662
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,959
they submit and we do the same it's if

663
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:02,149
we can if somebody submits a key and

664
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,520
they weren't able to to do anything with

665
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,870
it for example we we would research and

666
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,879
find that out and payout with the Maxis

667
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:10,969
and yes that's that's a good a good

668
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:15,740
example people want to submit they want

669
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:17,540
to engage with you and and and they want

670
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:27,380
the the path of least resistance for

671
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:28,430
sure if it's so if if they don't if

672
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,830
somebody doesn't provide a proof of

673
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,690
concept to us they'll need to have some

674
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:34,159
some kind of bare minimum so we can at

675
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,440
least reproduce the issue they're saying

676
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,510
if it looks out of place but they don't

677
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,890
necessarily need know if they somebody

678
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,060
gets access to a service or something we

679
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,770
don't necessarily need to have them just

680
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:46,010
like rifle through our whole

681
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:47,300
infrastructure it's it's seeing like if

682
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,850
they open a door what does that door do

683
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,770
and we we try to evaluate that and if we

684
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,969
are wrong if we think you know we

685
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,889
probably can't do anything like this we

686
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,090
might come back and say why don't you

687
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,310
try something else to see if you can

688
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:01,270
take it further but then it's in that

689
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,270
kind of controlled environment

690
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:21,230
so honestly I don't care how old

691
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:25,428
somebody is I don't care where they're

692
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,690
from the question was well how do we how

693
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:28,490
do we hold hackers accountable if we

694
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,730
don't know anything about them if

695
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:34,279
they're a real person or not it doesn't

696
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:35,990
really matter as long as we can as long

697
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:38,450
as we can understand and reproduce the

698
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:40,340
report coming in it makes us happy

699
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,070
that's that's on the that's on the

700
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:47,120
platform to care about me and I think

701
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:48,500
that there are a lot of really really

702
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,029
bright folks from all over the world of

703
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,100
all different ages doing this kind of

704
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:55,009
stuff and I think the more the more of

705
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:57,139
that we have that's that's my favorite

706
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:59,059
thing about all that is these completely

707
00:33:57,139 --> 00:34:01,428
radically different opinions that you

708
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:04,009
get from people who don't have formal

709
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:05,720
training necessarily don't look at

710
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:07,250
things the same way that you do you know

711
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,168
they're they're gonna see things with a

712
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,929
completely different point of view than

713
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:14,299
your researchers so it's it's great and

714
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:15,649
also there is a reputation system I

715
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,589
think through all these different

716
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:19,699
different platforms if people are acting

717
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:22,609
in good faith that are making good

718
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:24,230
submissions they could be 15 they could

719
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:26,328
be 50 it doesn't matter if they're

720
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,190
rising up the ranks of their their kind

721
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:40,040
of reputation like that says something

722
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:43,690
about the kind of stuff they submit well

723
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:46,690
have him have him come hack on us he can

724
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,690
yes

725
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,609
so the question was if we have a we have

726
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,890
a bug that comes in that does have a

727
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:13,560
real a real vulnerability and the

728
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:17,370
company wants to accept that risk how do

729
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:19,860
we respond to somebody so if there is a

730
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:21,480
real risk we're the ones making that

731
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:24,090
determination and we have really good

732
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,520
buy into the company to to trust us and

733
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:30,330
to accept that we we have judged that

734
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,070
for that to be real if it comes back

735
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,799
that we don't think it's severe enough

736
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,690
to do anything about that's on us and

737
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,520
we're making that choice and we will we

738
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:43,110
will reflect that back to the person

739
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:46,830
will tell them we we are not in the

740
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:48,150
business of like taking things on like

741
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,670
that and unless we have a really good

742
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,500
reason to and if if we didn't follow

743
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,180
something if we decided that it was

744
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,340
going to be something we just kind of

745
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,930
ignored there would have to be some

746
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,390
other control around it I think we're

747
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,819
really we're really lucky that we have

748
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:05,160
that buy-in from the team now we have

749
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,840
had things where it doesn't appear that

750
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,810
there's really any security implication

751
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,540
it might be might be a weird thing maybe

752
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:14,549
you can maybe you can break the UI

753
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:16,860
locally if you do something strange it's

754
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:18,060
not really a security bug it is a bug we

755
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:21,330
might follow it as a bug and let them

756
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,710
know that but we're we're as honest and

757
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,770
straightforward as possible as we can be

758
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:27,150
with that stuff and I think that's a big

759
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,680
reason why we get as much engagement as

760
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,900
we do and our program is we're pretty

761
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,310
transparent about a lot of that and I

762
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,280
think if you talk to some of the hackers

763
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:35,790
out there they would probably probably

764
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,350
say the same

765
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,340
you know the depending on what company

766
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:42,710
you're dealing with you may or may not

767
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,710
get that kind of that kind of response

768
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,959
yeah that's that's a good example like

769
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,690
if if there's something like that that

770
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,880
is so if you have you know domme a my

771
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,359
company Rostelecom clearly you know that

772
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,470
that company exists or at least somebody

773
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:18,450
decided to steal that name that that is

774
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,279
an accepted thing and if we had

775
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,930
something like that we would say it's

776
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,580
it's working as intended this is an

777
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,618
intentional feature we probably have it

778
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,990
documented somewhere as some kind of

779
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:29,369
accepted risk but we don't start to be

780
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,500
confident in saying that because if it

781
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:34,170
if if we do disclose that report that

782
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,430
that conversations gonna be there so we

783
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:38,900
want to be pretty confident that that's

784
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,899
the right answer the right way to go

785
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,300
anything else yes

786
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,529
that's a good question

787
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:19,180
I wouldn't say first off I wouldn't say

788
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:21,560
that the that the bug bounty program

789
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,509
necessarily picks up where the pen

790
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:27,560
testing leaves off I think there's a lot

791
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:30,290
of crossover we have gotten very similar

792
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:34,730
reports from like a like a pen test

793
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:47,180
company versus what we had come in can

794
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:49,220
you repeat the second part the yeah so I

795
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:51,980
I don't think we've ever had anything

796
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:54,740
like that that would have been would

797
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:57,380
have been useful for like to like talk

798
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,580
to sports or somebody like that we did

799
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,140
have the example like I said with Apache

800
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,910
where we've done like backported patches

801
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:04,100
I don't know if there's any been

802
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:05,660
anything specific well I guess we have

803
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,670
had a little bit so the the port server

804
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:14,500
one I mentioned earlier that I wanna wax

805
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:17,600
found that actually became a burr plugin

806
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:20,090
which he he wrote his talk and he wrote

807
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,830
the pay the white paper on that after he

808
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:24,950
made the plugin for himself got all his

809
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:26,420
bonus and then publicized that so so we

810
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,009
have had those but but I don't know if

811
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:32,500
any have resulted specifically from our

812
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:32,500
program yes

813
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:16,230
I'll come work for us and you can see it

814
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:19,078
so I I think knowing the knowing the

815
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:21,539
methodologies a wasp optin all that to

816
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:24,630
actually get in is super important and I

817
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:27,270
think we could probably see a situation

818
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:30,630
where people could see more of the other

819
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,799
side if we did private type bug many

820
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:34,140
things there are there are mechanisms

821
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:38,160
for that we've talked about that a

822
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:40,170
little bit so when we when we first

823
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,308
started in our paid program we didn't

824
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,440
have that public at all we invited

825
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:45,240
people in and we were also pretty frank

826
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,940
talking with those people if they had

827
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,589
questions about how things worked we

828
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,819
would tell them same with like the

829
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:53,700
mitigations here that I talked about

830
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:54,509
today if you're ever doing a bug bounty

831
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,538
program and there's something that's

832
00:40:54,510 --> 00:41:01,049
unclear try to engage with them on

833
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,579
Twitter or slack or whatever because we

834
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:04,650
want you to find stuff that you may not

835
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:06,210
see and we might give you clues or at

836
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:09,990
least explain how like the architecture

837
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:13,549
works in terms of actually seeing it

838
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:16,410
from the other side I I could see more

839
00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:17,549
like deeper collaborative penetration

840
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,410
testing stuff happening where you would

841
00:41:17,549 --> 00:41:21,480
say it from both sides there are some

842
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,819
like live hacking events that like

843
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,960
hacker one puts on where you're actually

844
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:26,130
sitting there with the security team at

845
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,990
the same time and then you have like

846
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,670
face to face where you're doing that so

847
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,808
I suspect there's gonna be a lot more of

848
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,450
that but I think we're still pretty

849
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:35,869
early in the the adoption phase which is

850
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,868
why I'm here

851
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:49,970
so coming back to what you mentioned I

852
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,370
think they're I think they're a

853
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:54,950
compliment so an internal red team is

854
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:56,509
gonna be doing a lot of the same stuff

855
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,950
we would expect from a bug program I

856
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,710
would say for red teaming probably more

857
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:05,450
like Network level stuff necessarily the

858
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:07,250
gap SEC stuff but we whether it's

859
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:09,470
whether it's a red team whether it's our

860
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,510
own team or an Assessor that we have

861
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,759
come in we're expecting the same kind of

862
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,930
reports from a bug bounty program we're

863
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,000
letting them hit the same kind of stuff

864
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,730
the only difference is we're not handing

865
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,020
our source code away to random up any

866
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:26,420
people so they're getting more of a

867
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:27,920
black box all right we probably have

868
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:32,060
time for like one more somebody wants to

869
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,420
throw anything out all right thank you

870
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,420
very much

871
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,690
you

872
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:49,130
you
