1
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:27,750
we are well you know the community is

2
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:30,669
broad we are all like makers hackers

3
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,590
students etc but like who put this

4
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:37,300
together we have also kind of a broad

5
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:39,760
group of people we have the board that

6
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,339
runs the the runs the organization we

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,489
have all the organizers who actually do

8
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:48,280
all the hard work I'm one of the people

9
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:52,390
on the board but not an organizer you

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,189
got lucky the badge makers who do also a

11
00:00:52,390 --> 00:01:04,629
lot of hard work and then everyone else

12
00:00:54,189 --> 00:01:07,049
the be hackers they make sure work all

13
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:09,040
right so we have some organizational

14
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:13,299
changes this year which are kind of

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,939
interesting so now for the after lots of

16
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,650
hard work that the besides board has has

17
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:20,320
done print principally John we are now a

18
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,640
501c3 nonprofit in the eyes of the

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,720
federal government which means that we

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:30,310
can accept tax-deductible donations that

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:33,370
are not in kind so that is super

22
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,810
exciting at least for me exciting for me

23
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,880
too because now on the box of like

24
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:41,710
filing taxes I can just say yes we're

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:44,229
exempt and I file really great anytime

26
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,429
anytime you want it doesn't have to just

27
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,860
be around here

28
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,799
you can donate us money and write it

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,390
down on your taxes it's fantastic so

30
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,729
because we're a non-profit if your

31
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,400
employer has a matching contribution we

32
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:59,260
can also get extra money that that is

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:04,750
also true of many employers do matching

34
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:06,940
contributions so the as I alluded to

35
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:10,090
earlier we have the beat besides Board

36
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,680
of Directors we have a Google Group

37
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:15,250
where we actually talk about things we

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,140
have we have board meetings every month

39
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:22,780
except for this month because it was the

40
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:25,540
ones day before besides and you guys are

41
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,739
all welcome to call in although at least

42
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,489
four board meetings that's mostly be

43
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:33,160
quiet I'm gonna have Topher talking

44
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,030
about the CFP process but we had once

45
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,040
again a better

46
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:50,980
CFP process than ever before that's

47
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:52,269
right so it's not without a proper

48
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,738
one-on-one talk with that actually

49
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,630
talking about what makes the conference

50
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,040
we're part of what makes the conference

51
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:59,950
so great and that's all the wonderful

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,019
speakers that have came up to give talks

53
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,060
to give workshops and to present

54
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,850
themselves and show what they're doing

55
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,470
to the world so this year the CFP

56
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,940
process we actually did a lot

57
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,590
differently and I'll get into that but

58
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,989
we also received more submissions than

59
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,489
ever this year we had in the three

60
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,930
digits for the first time which was

61
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:19,090
really wonderful but it also made the

62
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,560
job exceptionally difficult to to curate

63
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,590
and decide what we wanted to take in

64
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,450
this year we had two rounds round one

65
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,069
closed on the 15th and round two closed

66
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,290
on the 15th

67
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,510
basically by round one we had already

68
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,400
had so many high-quality content

69
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,920
submissions that round two is even more

70
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,420
exceptionally difficult so this is kind

71
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,548
of an homage to if you want to present

72
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,649
at conferences particularly ones that

73
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:44,350
are growing in capacity like this one we

74
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,690
have 800 people here now submit submit

75
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,489
stuff early get it into the review board

76
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,100
process people have more time to look at

77
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:53,290
it give feedback and usually a better

78
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:58,810
chance of getting up and presenting your

79
00:03:53,290 --> 00:04:00,910
work can I interrupt you yes another

80
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,650
thing we we gave people who submitted

81
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,850
the first round and we're not accepted

82
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,959
in the first round we kept them in for

83
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,400
the second round but we also gave them

84
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,489
feedback on why they weren't accepted

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,620
and of the people who took that feedback

86
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,239
revise their submission and resubmitted

87
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,120
it I think 80% of them made it in the

88
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,590
second round where was like 20% that

89
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,340
didn't I like followed that trickled

90
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,219
through to the second round

91
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,719
so yeah just I think that was a big

92
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,190
little a slight change that goes a long

93
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,130
way and toward towards what we're trying

94
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,500
to do definitely

95
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,030
and speaking of all of that feedback we

96
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,890
actually had a CFP review board this

97
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:37,270
year for the first time after after

98
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:39,250
eight years of being a conference moving

99
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,659
into the community at large we started

100
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,680
to realize that due to the fact that

101
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,740
we're getting hundreds of submissions

102
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,630
now we wanted to be able to give people

103
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,160
individualized feedback that wasn't

104
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,110
manageable with just one or two people

105
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,660
being the body of curating all of that

106
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,580
so we actually recruited local security

107
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,070
experts to help us go through all the

108
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,190
submissions and they took a lot of their

109
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,290
personal time in order to look at all of

110
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,830
those provide individual feedback and

111
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,780
give give Joe and I recommendations as

112
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,450
to how to make the conference what it is

113
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,099
and who we accepted so huge thanks to

114
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,630
the wonderful work of everybody on the

115
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,620
screen we had joy we had Maggie

116
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:20,020
Tim Morgan case Mari on myself Jesse

117
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,520
Michael Forrest and Emily really helped

118
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,130
us out with this so big big round of

119
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,900
applause for everybody that helped out

120
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:30,940
[Applause]

121
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,549
and and speaking of speakers and not the

122
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,170
kind that play music like I said we had

123
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,940
so many submissions this year and it

124
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,860
really was a lot of work for people on

125
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,930
the review board so if you run into

126
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,430
somebody please thank them and talk to

127
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,460
them about submitting and getting

128
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,840
getting yourself up on stage so with

129
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,159
that we're gonna transition out an

130
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:55,960
office deck so he's going to talk about

131
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:57,970
the Badgers all right they work don't

132
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:02,229
they I sure hope so they all passed QA

133
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:04,450
on Wednesday night so they're so what do

134
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:08,230
we have here this is our wonderful badge

135
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:11,050
this year so we have around 36 parts on

136
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,840
here mostly there are LEDs we are

137
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,420
Charlie flexing the LED yellow LEDs so

138
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,700
try flexing is you use few pins to drive

139
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,440
a whole bunch LEDs then we're doing

140
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,700
pulse width modulation to change the

141
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,680
brightness and the color on the RGB LEDs

142
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:30,340
so the microcontroller were using is an

143
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,880
eighty tiny a six one I wrote all the

144
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,729
firmware in Lib Navy RC no Arduinos were

145
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,529
harmed during the process

146
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:41,449
I'm an electrical engineer so I'm not

147
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:45,859
allowed to use Arduino that's what

148
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:49,399
academia told me so this year we have

149
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:51,829
USB programming via micronucleus you'll

150
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:54,079
need a script to run the programmer for

151
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:55,999
that otherwise there's the ICSP header

152
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,699
so you can do direct programming through

153
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,829
that the cost was pretty low this year

154
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:02,539
we got the bomb to be about five and

155
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:05,349
half dollars per board which is pretty

156
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:07,969
low compared to previous years I think

157
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:13,009
this was also the most complex layout we

158
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:14,959
had made things more difficult this year

159
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:18,019
we are also featuring shitty add-ons so

160
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:20,509
the hearts have the headers from the

161
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:23,689
shitty add-ons there press-fit so the

162
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:25,759
normal is 0.1 inch spacing so these are

163
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:27,709
point one one inch so you don't have to

164
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,729
solder you should just be able to push

165
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:33,739
them in and hold and this is completely

166
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:36,649
open-source hardware so the layout

167
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:38,929
schematic building materials firmware is

168
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:43,009
all on the github link and you can go

169
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:47,119
there and hack the badge so how did this

170
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:49,069
happen back for a Def Con I heard about

171
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:51,469
the shitty add-ons so I decided to make

172
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:55,459
my own shady add-on featured up there

173
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:58,039
for DC 503 the Portland Def Con group so

174
00:07:55,459 --> 00:08:00,349
basically I took the same concept the

175
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:02,599
are same LEDs and a similar

176
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:05,479
microcontroller and made it bigger and

177
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,849
add some more functionality to it so

178
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:11,659
with the hardware we follow a waterfall

179
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:13,450
there's no agile scrum JIRA crap with

180
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:17,150
hardware

181
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,680
so basically it's an idea figure out

182
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:21,620
what parts you need for a schematic

183
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:26,210
together make up some art do the layout

184
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:28,670
and kicad and make a prototype fix your

185
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,099
mistakes on the prototype then do a

186
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:34,060
final build no no second prototype

187
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,289
because we do this last minute right

188
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:38,299
protip is definitely make more than one

189
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,069
prototype and have more time in the

190
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:43,250
development process I think we did this

191
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,440
in about three months so the tools I use

192
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,080
was Inkscape with this plug-in called

193
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,830
SVG to shinjin it basically allows you

194
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,770
to do all the layout layout artwork in

195
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,360
Inkscape then export to kicad so you can

196
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,880
do the copper layer silk screen layer

197
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,250
solder mask inside of the vector arts

198
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:06,130
program then export that to something

199
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:09,610
kicad can understand and and kicad the

200
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:12,020
twilights kinetics and circuitry stuff

201
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,040
altogether this took probably over 200

202
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,329
hours to do

203
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,939
it's very laborious and during the

204
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,920
process a lot of mistakes were made not

205
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,140
all of them were necessarily caught I

206
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,110
did things like mirroring footprints and

207
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,640
shorting some of the LEDs to ground so

208
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:34,880
thank you Joe for catching those

209
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:37,640
mistakes and also I think the red and no

210
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,620
the blue and the green LED pins were

211
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,930
mislabeled so I had to fix that in

212
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,100
firmer which is pretty common for

213
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,760
hardware mistakes to be fixed in

214
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,590
firmware

215
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,510
if you've ever dealt with CPU

216
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:53,060
development they they fix those so big

217
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,790
thanks to ash Park they sponsored the

218
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,160
circuit board as well as the Assembly of

219
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,500
the boards this year then it's the first

220
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,050
time ash Park is done board assembly

221
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,850
normally they just do PCBs and we have

222
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,219
to source the manufacturing to some

223
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,110
other company by them doing this it

224
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,300
really helped us out financially so big

225
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:15,650
thanks to ash Park

226
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,180
so josh josh clark also like we were

227
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,829
there too they used us as a test vehicle

228
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,630
because they started a new like fab

229
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,610
option so they just announced it

230
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,380
thursday and we were we were the beta

231
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,310
test for them to go and figure out how

232
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,650
they're gonna work with this this

233
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,869
fabrication partner so we were we were

234
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,579
lucky to benefit from that and and and

235
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,010
and ash parks generosity yet again

236
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,390
they've they've donated thousands and

237
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,360
thousands and thousands of dollars of

238
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:41,270
PCB expenses over the past several years

239
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,620
so thank them yes and they're also

240
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,540
they're not here today because they are

241
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,730
currently with the vendor they're

242
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:51,079
working with to finalize more plans so

243
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:52,610
gray so I'd like to thank Joe grant for

244
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:59,090
kind of starting this whole entire badge

245
00:10:52,610 --> 00:11:00,980
life stuff so back in 2006 is when the

246
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,110
first Def Con electronic badge was made

247
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,450
and so that kind of got the ball rolling

248
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,670
for all this craziness I'd like to thank

249
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,260
Joe for helping with the layout and

250
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:12,110
review and getting the micronucleus

251
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,850
bootloader for the board root killer for

252
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:18,320
helping with micro nucleus and other

253
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:23,510
programming myself for doing the largest

254
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,280
amount of the board work we had a bunch

255
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:29,180
of volunteers Wednesday night hammering

256
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,730
out the PCBs basically one we had one

257
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,390
panel about yay big that had two badges

258
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,860
on it and we have 500 electronic badges

259
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,470
so that was a manual process of taking

260
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,660
hammers and chisels to pound out the

261
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,760
badges so that was quite some work there

262
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,500
and everyone that did the programming

263
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,500
and stuffing the badges into the bags

264
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,319
so now we're gonna transition into so

265
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,610
none of you now after this you're not

266
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,080
gonna need to read the website to know

267
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:11,420
what's going on because we're gonna tell

268
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:15,200
you the former badge maker and like

269
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:17,329
obvious debts hairs is still on fire and

270
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,270
he's still like shell-shocked from the

271
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:31,310
experience the last week when he did a

272
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:33,680
phenomenal job just don't don't let him

273
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,000
know that it once he utterly just kind

274
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,030
of drop like a favorite fails we won't

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,200
make him do it again

276
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,610
you keep succeeding you keep getting the

277
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,770
job back that's right

278
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,510
speaking of which if you notice your

279
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:48,670
badge is kind of blinking but not

280
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,670
blinking all the way I using USB power

281
00:12:50,350 --> 00:13:07,670
but take the battery out yes all right

282
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:22,340
so we have an quiz show we've done this

283
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:23,599
I think before you click here you

284
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,120
actually have to go to the website yes

285
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,760
when I ride you have here that you have

286
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:33,140
to go to the b-sides website which it is

287
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,880
there and this is great the question was

288
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,699
awesome it's ran by uh Steve and he's a

289
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,960
huge gamer dungeon master in D&D and

290
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,630
he's really good at coming up with

291
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,460
contests and and quiz criteria so

292
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,990
definitely go sit in on this there's

293
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,490
gonna be people up on stage it's it's

294
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,440
like a tamer version of like hacker

295
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,200
jeopardy at Def Con cuz obviously we're

296
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:56,150
in the convention center and people yeah

297
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:59,720
I can't say any more than that and

298
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,100
hopefully people aren't as you don't

299
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,610
have to be sober but it's also not

300
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,650
DEFCON we also have for the first year

301
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:10,040
this year ascent CTF for missing persons

302
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,490
so we were approached by Trace Labs this

303
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,110
year to

304
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,430
to run this event they've had tremendous

305
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,470
success for it with it at other

306
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,120
conferences it's essentially a

307
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,100
competition that's gonna take place

308
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,290
tomorrow from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. in

309
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,570
the event room and it's open source

310
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,750
intelligence to find actual missing

311
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,910
people utilizing like FBI databases and

312
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,220
stuff and everything is if basically

313
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,439
using legal means to search the internet

314
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,060
for missing people and there's there's

315
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,830
flags and stuff that you can capture and

316
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,660
they're gonna walk you through like what

317
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,640
databases to search for awesome like

318
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,870
Google dorks to look for people and it

319
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,459
should be a really good time and we're

320
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,050
super excited to have them here for it

321
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:47,089
they're a start-up out of Toronto I

322
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,589
believe so they traveled all the way

323
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:52,640
here just to run this event for us so

324
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:54,320
super stoked we also have for the first

325
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,550
year this this year you might have if

326
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,279
you've seen it in the event room already

327
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:01,490
there's a big bin for a backpack drive

328
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:03,740
for foster youth so every conference

329
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,990
that people tend to go to including this

330
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,580
one people tend to like give out

331
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,080
backpacks and things of that nature that

332
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,060
nobody actually really wants and they

333
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,470
get thrown in the trash I'm sure a lot

334
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,029
of you have a lot of backpacks in your

335
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,250
closet from various conferences that

336
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:17,779
you're never going to use bring those in

337
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,260
and let's get them donated and have them

338
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:22,700
go towards a good cause so these the

339
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,110
bins are gonna be in the the event room

340
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,399
all weekend's they're gonna we're gonna

341
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,410
ensure that they get to the right people

342
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,180
and yeah bring in your backpacks and

343
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,649
bring in bring in your shitty black hat

344
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,770
backpack that you never wanted in the

345
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:35,180
first place and it's gonna go to some to

346
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,529
some kid and they're gonna think what's

347
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,439
that and you're gonna make the next

348
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:40,790
hacker out there that's right they're

349
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,709
gonna Google what black hat is me like

350
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:47,180
oh this is amazing we also have

351
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:49,160
Carmageddon this year this is actually a

352
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,439
really popular event in recent years

353
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,819
it's caused a lot of awesome ruckus and

354
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,140
people have gotten perma banned from

355
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:59,240
reddit so sign up for karma gating and

356
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,350
try to harvest all that karma and you

357
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:06,470
know if you get banned from reddit you

358
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:08,120
probably get a pretty cool prize we also

359
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,649
have lightning talks this year so we

360
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,899
unfortunately had some last-minute

361
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:13,339
cancellations and while Joe and I were

362
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:15,800
thinking of how we handle that it's like

363
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,149
why don't we just do lightning talks we

364
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,939
haven't done it before we're gonna try

365
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:21,290
it out this year so we have about 10 to

366
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,900
12 slots for it we're gonna do

367
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,800
five-minute cut-offs for talks I'm going

368
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,269
to be emceeing that

369
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,160
so come check me down during the

370
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:31,010
conference during the b-sides PDX 101

371
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,449
panel this is where I weigh if or in the

372
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,250
event room because I'll primarily be

373
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,170
over there is one of the CTF organizers

374
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,540
to come find me and sign up so far I've

375
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,660
got two people on the list so if you're

376
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:44,209
interested come find me going kind of in

377
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,579
tune to Jessica Payne's keynote and the

378
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:48,469
opportunity and sponsorship aspect of

379
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:50,359
getting people out there and making

380
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,769
people known this is a really good

381
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,060
opportunity to get on stage and just

382
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:54,380
talk about whatever you want for five

383
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,420
minutes it doesn't need to be security

384
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,860
it can be can be policy it can be a cool

385
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,630
project that you're working on or or

386
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,060
anything just get up on stage to talk

387
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,040
for five minutes and you know get your

388
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:10,550
ideas out there you can find me you can

389
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:11,839
do this so now transitioning and this is

390
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:15,319
something that you know you can boo me

391
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,780
offstage because I'm actually this more

392
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:19,550
more slides and probably needed but I'm

393
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,230
one of the I've been running the besides

394
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:24,438
Portland CTF for the last three years

395
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,870
now and let's talk about it so if you're

396
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,120
not familiar with CTF it's always

397
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:30,979
important to go over terms so

398
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,870
capture-the-flag is a computer security

399
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,000
competition it's basically you hack on

400
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,100
vulnerable binaries web challenges soft

401
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,770
forensics puzzles and things of that

402
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,389
nature to find flags and those flags you

403
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,710
concatenate to a leaderboard and that

404
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,080
earns you points and you can see your

405
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,660
rank and compete against peers and this

406
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,480
like sort of like hacker hacker Olympics

407
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,309
so to speak a lot of CTFs are actually

408
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,429
pretty intimidating and a little bit

409
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:57,379
overly challenging especially for events

410
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:59,179
such as b-sides where we try to keep all

411
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,770
of the challenges somewhat introductory

412
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,570
at the beginning and as you progress

413
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:05,660
through the levels they get harder much

414
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:07,490
like a Jeopardy board would so we very

415
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,470
intentionally try to make it so that if

416
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:11,090
you've never played CTF before if you've

417
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,800
never hack the web challenge or you've

418
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,199
never done it buffer overflow on a

419
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,490
binary come play in the CTF room we'll

420
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,660
get you started will tell you the tools

421
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,640
and we'll show you the tips and tricks

422
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,740
to succeed and you can cat your first

423
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,150
flag if you've never done anything so

424
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,450
definitely come find us and definitely

425
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:29,570
come play this year we did 12 challenges

426
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,580
across four domains so last year we did

427
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:35,330
a four by four board and we realized

428
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:37,580
that the challenges while they kind of

429
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,879
fit that nature of introductory there's

430
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,550
some

431
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,530
that scale up in difficulty a lot of

432
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,350
them were it was just too much for a

433
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,820
two-day conference of this nature so we

434
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,800
kind of scaled it back a little bit and

435
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,600
really really ated what we wanted to do

436
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,970
and how we wanted to position the CTF

437
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,709
and one one really excellent piece of

438
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,290
feedback that we got was everything the

439
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,730
way to offensive focused there's no

440
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,530
defensive challenges there's no

441
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,600
forensics and there's nothing that you

442
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,070
can just utilize like Google for really

443
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,209
now there other than like getting

444
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,139
walkthroughs and stuff there was nothing

445
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,490
directly like I can Google to get flag

446
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,380
so we we kind of took a step back and

447
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,120
we're like okay we definitely need to do

448
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,030
web and binary exploitation

449
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,770
it's a CTF those need to be there but

450
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,240
then we were thinking well let's do a

451
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,860
forensics challenge there's a lot of

452
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,360
people that do blue teaming there's a

453
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,850
lot of people that sit in socks that are

454
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,199
doing correlation rule isn't logging so

455
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,550
let's have some forensics challenges for

456
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,990
those people so they can also get

457
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:33,800
involved with the CTF and cat some

458
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:36,140
points and then when the ocean CTF got

459
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,389
accepted it's like that sounds really

460
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,920
cool that's all about open sourcing

461
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,450
intelligence for missing people

462
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,310
we should also probably do an ocean

463
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:46,550
category for the CTF that's a little bit

464
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:48,020
more gamified and a little bit silly so

465
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,520
if you go on the ocean challenges you'll

466
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,310
actually see some pretty interesting

467
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,790
stuff I will say no more you should you

468
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,790
should check it out

469
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,209
I'd be amiss not to take Jessica's

470
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,790
advice to give a sponsorship and

471
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:04,220
opportunity so this year we had Mozilla

472
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:06,830
once again sponsor or CTF infrastructure

473
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,690
and daniel did a tremendous job with it

474
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,340
and i'm gonna he's gonna run up on stage

475
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,370
to talk about it really quick this is

476
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,110
when you grown up on stage and he's

477
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:17,750
gonna talk about it a little bit he was

478
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:20,389
in germany working on the infrastructure

479
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,460
for us like the last two weeks and he's

480
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,810
like on vacation in Germany and we're

481
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,830
messaging it's like yeah this is a lot

482
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:26,210
more you sure you want to do it you're

483
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,860
on vacation he's like no this is awesome

484
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:31,730
I'm doing it so he's gonna talk about

485
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:33,979
doing it thanks hey everybody

486
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,410
yeah so I'm Daniel or working Mozilla

487
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:40,400
and I just put a few ball points here

488
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:41,900
this is put a few bullet points here

489
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,600
with some of the stuff that we set up so

490
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:47,900
we've got a kubernetes cluster running

491
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:50,870
in AWS utilizing the eks service which

492
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,000
is great a couple simple things like

493
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:55,840
using Kalka

494
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,149
for basically restricted network access

495
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,370
cubed I am to kind of bind pods to

496
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:02,570
certain roles in the account are backed

497
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,529
in enabled cluster which is pretty

498
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:08,178
normal so yeah a couple things there to

499
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:09,590
try to lock stuff down but the main

500
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:12,830
thing is that we want to really

501
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:14,149
encourage everybody that participates in

502
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,039
the CTF to see if they can break the

503
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:18,439
cluster break into it maybe compromise

504
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:21,260
the account tell me what I did wrong

505
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,299
so that would be fantastic and note that

506
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,980
I didn't put on here was regarding

507
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:27,679
Mozilla's bug right

508
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:31,090
yeah but bounty program so if anybody

509
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,350
wants to or if anybody does you know

510
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,840
attempt to break into the cluster like

511
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,340
that I we'd love to hear submissions

512
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,840
through most of those bug bounty program

513
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:43,610
if you have any questions feel free to

514
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:46,340
come talk to me so oh yeah so I actually

515
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:49,580
don't know the yeah maybe you should

516
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:56,539
make a comment here but the we have a

517
00:21:49,580 --> 00:22:00,668
number if I assume that will be doing

518
00:21:56,539 --> 00:22:02,809
paid bounties for different levels of

519
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:04,549
compromise in the cluster or the account

520
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:07,610
but actually don't know the severity

521
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:08,929
levels that will throw there yeah yeah

522
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:17,719
yeah not t-shirts

523
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:19,190
well maybe extra t-shirt please do it

524
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,360
challenges and then hack the cluster

525
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,120
because once you hack a challenge you're

526
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,039
on the cluster exactly yeah

527
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,018
yeah you got you had access that

528
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,679
container that pod and yeah see see

529
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:29,679
where you can get

530
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,760
[Applause]

531
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,760
so there's also a big things that needs

532
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,990
to get out the dream team that I had

533
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,150
behind me this year writing the

534
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,100
challenges and taking commands as to

535
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,380
assigning people challenge category so

536
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:52,149
big shout-out to FD Carl he wrote all of

537
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:57,340
the web challenges for us this year huge

538
00:22:52,150 --> 00:23:03,370
shout out to a Galaga yeah how is your

539
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:05,740
handle pronounced hey Gallic is good he

540
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,820
did the binary exploitation challenges

541
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,770
they're freaking awesome

542
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,360
we have Dade that did all of the ocean

543
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,410
challenges for us and then we have I

544
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:16,810
also don't know how to say this handle

545
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:18,580
eight Ariane Ariane Aaron Aaron he's in

546
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,889
the CTF from hacking on go find him

547
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,659
and then of course huge thanks to the

548
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:25,480
Mozilla guys for sponsoring us yet again

549
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:27,160
with the infrastructure if you've been

550
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,470
to besides or you saw my talk last year

551
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,210
or played CTF last year you've you've

552
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,820
heard that I'm a huge proponent for open

553
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,650
sourcing CTF both the infrastructure and

554
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,540
the challenges this is something that

555
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,460
doesn't happen within the CTF community

556
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:42,159
after the events are done typically

557
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,900
you'll get all of the binaries and

558
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,240
people will do write-ups but there's

559
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,670
never any how is this done how is it

560
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,680
orchestrated so we publish all of our

561
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,390
CTF all of the solutions that we've came

562
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,340
up with all of the challenges and all of

563
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,750
the infrastructure deployments so if you

564
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,830
might you might not have the chance to

565
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,020
play this weekend because you're doing

566
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,389
the hallway track or seeing talks go to

567
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,950
the link everything is docker compose so

568
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:05,770
you can run it locally on on your Linux

569
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:07,750
box or or whatever your OS of choices

570
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,960
that works with docker and you can go

571
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,550
and play so definitely do that open

572
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,170
source and CTF is important if you know

573
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,300
people are writing CTF stuff that aren't

574
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:17,440
open sourcing it yell at them and tell

575
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,000
them they need to open source stuff

576
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,770
because it's awesome

577
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,660
and of course come to closing ceremonies

578
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,940

challenge writing helping out doing the

582
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:33,010

583
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,780
to me I would love to have more people

584
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,710

585
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,710
even less work next year

586
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:43,590
come play besides PDX CTF dot party yeah

587
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:43,590
question

588
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:03,890
