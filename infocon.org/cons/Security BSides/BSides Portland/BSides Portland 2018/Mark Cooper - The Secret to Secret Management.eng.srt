1
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,640
thanks Maggie well actually I think this

2
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,810
is a great segue I just walked in it

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,150
sounds like you guys were talking a lot

4
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,640
about passwords and I spent a lot of my

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,369
time talking about passwords even though

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,689
I don't deal with passwords you know

7
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,030
I'll explain a little bit why in a

8
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,830
little bit so as Maggie said I'm mark

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,879
Cooper I'm the president of PKI

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,920
solutions

11
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,570
I actually am based here in Portland I

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,360
started the company about five years ago

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,059
after leaving Microsoft at Microsoft I

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,280
spent my time working just in the PGI

15
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,989
space so it's been about 20 years now

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,520
that I've been focused in the public key

17
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:55,800
infrastructure PKI is something that is

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,899
kind of very near and dear to me it was

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,239
one of those technologies when somebody

20
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,489
sat me down and said we need you to kind

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,289
of learn this everyone's afraid of it

22
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,610
and no one really understands it that

23
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:07,320
does anyone have that feeling about

24
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,340
things like PKI or their types of

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,089
security yeah you know what I found

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,619
there's something to be said for

27
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,320
understanding and really being

28
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,990
passionate about a technology niche it

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,460
makes it much easier to develop a very

30
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,559
deep skill set

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,110
PKI has really been that one thing for

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,060
me as much as I like to go around saying

33
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,490
I'm the PKI guy when I was at Microsoft

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,909
I can't really say that Bill Gates came

35
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:36,539
down and did me the PKI guy I kind of

36
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,799
hacked a system accidentally and it

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,759
wound up replicating throughout

38
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,710
Microsoft and my job title changed

39
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,900
luckily and my boss was ok with it but I

40
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,449
didn't get paid for a little while so I

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,829
had to get that thick so if you ever saw

42
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,970
an office space in the glitch I

43
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:55,589
inflicted the glitch on myself for a

44
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,479
little while

45
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:03,210
so PKI solutions we primarily focus on

46
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:05,759
identity and encryption doing training

47
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,910
consulting and working with customers to

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,579
design PKI but it's often driven by a

49
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,200
very central problem that you're

50
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:15,750
probably facing your organization's

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,690
today so today we're really going to be

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,910
talking about this concept of secrets

53
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,920
secrets kind of vary by organization and

54
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,440
what you're trying to protect but they

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,239
all kind of go back to the same

56
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:33,320
thing from a business to a department or

57
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,330
an agency whatever you are working in

58
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,430
the odds are you have some piece of

59
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:41,600
information whether it's data or

60
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:43,610
identities or even intellectual property

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,280
that is a secret to you that you're not

62
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:49,220
trying to openly share with the the

63
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,200
world most organizations have something

64
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,450
that they need to keep secret sometimes

65
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,459
it's passwords sometimes it's the data

66
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,440
you're processing sometimes it's just

67
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,030
the very nature of what you do so if you

68
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,040
ever gone to organizations where there's

69
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,350
lots of physical security and there's

70
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,750
lots of well defined processes they're

71
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,400
trying to control access to things from

72
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,950
a data perspective that becomes much

73
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,590
harder so what we wanted to talk about

74
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,299
today was trying to define what are some

75
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,520
of these secrets that you're most likely

76
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,380
already running into in your

77
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,900
organization what are some of those

78
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,370
challenges as well as what are some of

79
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,000
the things that you could be doing to

80
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:28,600
address those secrets so some of the

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,890
things I wanted to talk about today

82
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,540
let's take a look at what we're

83
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,880
currently seeing in the landscape and

84
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,130
it's not meant to be a real in-depth

85
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,260
overview of the IT landscape but just to

86
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,090
kind of give you a foundation of what we

87
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,820
want to talk about but talk about what

88
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,830
those typical secrets are and I want to

89
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,090
share some solutions and options with

90
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,489
you that you could actually explore

91
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,370
today so I didn't want this just to be a

92
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,200
nice abstract talk on secrets and no

93
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,580
concepts that you should do I want to

94
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,470
give you some options that you can

95
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,060
actually walk away with and actually

96
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,810
consider if you're not already using

97
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:05,780
some of these in your organization so in

98
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:09,019
the landscape that we have today most

99
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,730
organizations are either currently being

100
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:12,620
affected because secrets are being

101
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,359
leaked out of the organization or

102
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,950
they're actively trying to do something

103
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,799
to prevent that does anyone actually

104
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:21,490
suffered any type of a loss of data or

105
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:24,229
identities or passwords that you know of

106
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:27,410
whew how many people think maybe you

107
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:29,600
have but you just don't know yeah that's

108
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,430
kind of what most organizations kind of

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,440
function under either you have or you

110
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,220
suspect maybe you have most

111
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,219
organizations

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:47,880
there is a eventualities the concepts of

113
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,470
what information people are after

114
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,920
changes from year to year I've been in

115
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,480
the IT space for 30 years early in my

116
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,430
career we used to say the only people

117
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,970
that were subject to potentially hacking

118
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,340
or federal agencies people with patents

119
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,620
and IP and hidden secrets and formulas

120
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,419
like Coke and you could say well we're

121
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,490
not coca-cola we don't have some secret

122
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,910
recipe we don't need to worry about IT

123
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,630
security no one's after my information

124
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:18,010
that's kind of completely changed now is

125
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,500
interesting for me years ago having

126
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,000
heard about healthcare information one

127
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,420
of the most valuable pieces of

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,490
information that hackers are after so

129
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,230
what we may be facing today is going to

130
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,090
be very different tomorrow the

131
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,370
management of these secrets is also

132
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,619
changing but the concepts that we're

133
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,630
dealing with now different than five or

134
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,850
ten years ago moving things into the

135
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,460
cloud and hosted services and managed

136
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:45,160
services years ago it used to be we kept

137
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,440
all that stuff in house we had physical

138
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,690
barriers we had well-defined protections

139
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,080
we weren't taking our data and sticking

140
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:55,030
out on the Internet it used to be even

141
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,310
where I worked at organizations and

142
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,080
corporate IT where we would say if

143
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,150
anything was coming from the Internet

144
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,530
and touching our environment we didn't

145
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,419
want them to access our critical

146
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,030
information maybe you can connect to get

147
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,950
email now organizations are a wholesale

148
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,989
shifting a lot of information into the

149
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,430
cloud and not giving a whole lot of

150
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,890
thought about what are we putting up

151
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,110
there and how are we protecting it so

152
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,090
the landscape is changing we're no

153
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,550
longer being tasked with how do we build

154
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:24,159
walls and keep people out it's how do we

155
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,800
put things out in the world and hope and

156
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,860
prevent people from reading it and it

157
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,330
takes one Mis configuration now it used

158
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,060
to be if it was sitting on your server

159
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,440
in your data center if someone couldn't

160
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,420
physically get in your building your

161
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,420
information was protected it's only the

162
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:42,100
employee that may steal something now

163
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,130
it's sitting in Azure

164
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,380
that's sitting in AWS and hopefully

165
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:51,800
someone doesn't miss configure something

166
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:54,800
very different landscape so from a

167
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,990
concept of secrets secrets are often

168
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,960
associated either with information or

169
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,550
data and every organization is a little

170
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,349
different as far as how they're managing

171
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,780
secrets but the things that we typically

172
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,610
see are things like passwords and it's

173
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,590
one of those things that dislike this

174
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,889
session before lots of talks about

175
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:15,289
passwords how do we make sure our users

176
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:17,030
don't have weak passwords in many ways

177
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,830
that's managing the secret how do we

178
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,869
make sure that their secret isn't so

179
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,659
easy to guess that someone else is out

180
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,210
there impersonating them also how do we

181
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,530
make sure it's not so complex that they

182
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,989
can't possibly remember their own

183
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:35,869
password we also have issues around

184
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,760
encryption most of you probably have

185
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,460
some type of encryption you're doing in

186
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,440
your organization whether it's

187
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,930
encryption of files maybe your entire

188
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,389
disk of a BitLocker it could be data

189
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,289
encryption but you're doing some type of

190
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:50,479
encryption

191
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:53,419
it may be embed inside an application

192
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,820
but most of us know that if there's a

193
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:58,700
checkbox to encrypt it must be more

194
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,440
secure but we're not often giving a lot

195
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,810
of thought to how is that encryption

196
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:07,270
being protected where are those keys

197
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:10,430
but those underlying secrets potentially

198
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:13,159
become a big issue anyone remember the

199
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:16,910
the Sony hack from well is it ten years

200
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,860
ago now so one of the most interesting

201
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,449
stories for me out of that wasn't so

202
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,430
much of the the information about the

203
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:25,360
celebrities and all the dish and the

204
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,680
salary there was a code signing

205
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,510
certificate that was in that trove and

206
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,599
did anyone ever hear the story about

207
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:36,080
this code signing cert so there's some

208
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:38,719
irony if you go back 20 years Sony had

209
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,760
some really bad publicity around 2000

210
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,240
they were putting a rootkit into all of

211
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,740
their music CDs remember this so they

212
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,020
were used to signing code they were

213
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,209
putting these things on their CDs well

214
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,740
when the Sony hack went out it wasn't

215
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,689
the same certificate but it was along

216
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,110
the same lines their code signing

217
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:59,420
certificate with the private key and

218
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,480
password we're in the information that

219
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,490
was disclosed now it's not necessarily

220
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,350
that embarrassing but the interesting

221
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,209
thing is a researcher took that code

222
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,519
signing cert and signed a piece of

223
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:13,550
malware and then send it to a buddy

224
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,230
saying hey look what Sony is up to well

225
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,910
the story got away from me the buddy

226
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,829
didn't realize it was a joke

227
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,990
he simply saw hey here's the piece of

228
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:23,810
malware signed by Sony what was Sony up

229
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,029
to that's really bad from a reputation

230
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,369
standpoint now there wasn't a lot of

231
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:30,230
mainstream press covering that but

232
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,630
that's just an example of Secrets

233
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,550
getting out and unintentionally

234
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:38,240
affecting the reputation of an

235
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:39,740
organization other places that we're

236
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,220
looking at things like crypto wallets

237
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,230
people doing bitcoins and other types of

238
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,240
digital currencies all of that

239
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,310
information goes back to maintaining

240
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,670
some secret that is your digital wallet

241
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,890
we see the same things with API keys a

242
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,079
lot of the cloud providers now aren't

243
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,630
necessarily using passwords but they

244
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,760
have some type of a token or an API that

245
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,470
allows one application to talk to

246
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,839
another application it might as well

247
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,880
just be called the passwords if you go

248
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,990
into a screen it says okay paste your

249
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,459
private API key here your private token

250
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,870
change the label to password because

251
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:17,449
that's all they're really doing it's

252
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,660
just a password well all of those

253
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:22,729
secrets need to be managed somehow now

254
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,610
things like passwords we've got nice

255
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,839
established practices for but not a lot

256
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,579
of people are thinking about how are we

257
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,220
managing these encryption keys how are

258
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:34,630
we managing these tokens what are we

259
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,920
doing to get ahead of this problem

260
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,570
so there's a couple of things that I

261
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,149
often work with customers to try to

262
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,370
figure out is in order to get your

263
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:44,420
handle around the secrets part of the

264
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,699
problem is trying to figure out what

265
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,899
secrets do you have and it's not that

266
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:50,689
they've necessarily done a great job

267
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:52,910
obscuring this information it's a lot of

268
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,620
time they just don't know what it is you

269
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,420
sit down and say what types of

270
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,339
encryption keys do you have what types

271
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,649
of API keys do you have how are your

272
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:04,190
applications working and a lot of times

273
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:06,140
they go I don't know so a lot of this is

274
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,449
actually just effort trying to figure

275
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,569
out what types of secrets are we using

276
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:13,609
and how are we going to go about man

277
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:16,640
so a couple of things that we need to do

278
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,340
one try to figure out what secrets what

279
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,740
types of keys you have I have gone into

280
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,570
large organizations where I expected the

281
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,980
IT shop to have a pretty good handle on

282
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:29,990
here's our systems no they don't and the

283
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,750
discussion often goes here's what we

284
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,910
should do but you're probably not going

285
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,160
to do you should have a list of what all

286
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,719
these critical systems are and let's go

287
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,459
figure out what types of encryption

288
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,860
they're doing what types of keys they're

289
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,820
using what types of tokens they have and

290
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:49,910
the IT the security the director the VP

291
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:52,340
goes hey I don't know don't know what it

292
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,800
is so I go okay let's take this as a

293
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,260
more practical approach what makes your

294
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,300
business function if you're a bank the

295
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,540
ability for tellers to take money in and

296
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,010
do wire transfers and ATMs you should be

297
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,689
able to at least establish what's your

298
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,000
critical thing what keeps the lights on

299
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:12,880
makes your widgets now we don't know

300
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,310
that either and this is happening

301
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,250
everywhere I go so if we want to talk

302
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:22,939
about responsible security and managing

303
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:25,010
data correctly if you don't even have an

304
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,710
accurate idea of where you're doing

305
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,510
encryption and what that data is there's

306
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,550
no way you can get ahead of this and

307
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:35,089
then you start scattering this stuff up

308
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:37,130
into cloud managed services offsite

309
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:39,530
services how are you ever going to

310
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,330
figure these things out you have to

311
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,240
start somewhere if you can't identify

312
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:47,240
every system figure out what you do know

313
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,020
touch what you can know there's an old

314
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,850
saying how do you eat an elephant one

315
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,050
bite at a time

316
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,700
it's gonna take a while to get through

317
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,439
all of it and if you don't know what all

318
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,150
the systems are at least figure out what

319
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,650
you do if you're managing an email

320
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,020
system if you're managing a github

321
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,610
whatever repositories you have at least

322
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,680
put down on a spreadsheet and say let's

323
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,300
figure these things out and when you get

324
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,300
that done you'll find out what that next

325
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,219
thing is but you have to start somewhere

326
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:16,099
the other thing is you need some way of

327
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:19,400
controlling access to those systems and

328
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,140
to those private secrets if you don't

329
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,480
have a way of protecting and managing

330
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,590
those secrets there's nothing that you

331
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,270
can do from an inventor

332
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,640
standpoint or from a documentation

333
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:31,069
standpoint or security if you can't

334
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,840
control access if you bring all your

335
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,820
secrets into one place and you can't

336
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:38,000
control them what have you just created

337
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,440
a honeypot you have created a very

338
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,890
attractive place on your network for

339
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,870
someone to attack so don't bring all

340
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,790
these things together without some plan

341
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:50,839
of how you're going to protect them and

342
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,849
control access the other thing is try to

343
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,980
figure out what types of permissions you

344
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,720
have out there who is able to create

345
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,630
these keys who's able to make these

346
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,420
connections who's changing secrets who's

347
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,970
implementing these secrets these could

348
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,920
be functioning at user levels they could

349
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:10,190
be machines applications and processes

350
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,020
or services there may be a whole set of

351
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,300
applications that you don't have

352
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,449
visibility of there are either affecting

353
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,589
or changing these secrets or

354
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,450
unintentionally divulging information

355
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:22,400
about them so you really need to know

356
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,380
what's that play here and again like I

357
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,390
said if you can't get a grasp of what

358
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,580
all of those systems are and let all of

359
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,010
those applications and process these are

360
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,910
start with what you can identify that

361
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:36,650
core list and then grow from there

362
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,959
the other thing that we need to do once

363
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,600
we start tracking down what types of

364
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,339
keys and API is we are are using is

365
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,400
trying to figure out how they're using

366
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:48,470
and what that normal pattern is one of

367
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,230
the difficulty thing or difficult things

368
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,690
that we have is detecting abnormal use

369
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,250
if I know I have a particular key and

370
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,589
that token should only be used between

371
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,240
these two applications and suddenly it

372
00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:01,430
starts being used somewhere else or

373
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,460
coming off of the internet or being sent

374
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,770
to a cloud service those things are

375
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,870
something that I want to detect the good

376
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,579
thing is a lot of these secrets tend to

377
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,950
be static when we start looking at

378
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,020
things like encryption keys these tend

379
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,000
to be things that are long-lived one of

380
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,730
the benefits of not using passwords is

381
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,040
these secrets if well-managed can be

382
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,150
valid for longer periods of time so

383
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,029
there was a question earlier about

384
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,189
passwords of no 30 days 90 days 60 days

385
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:29,990
why do we change them so frequently

386
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:34,130
because they're so easily guessed or so

387
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,890
easily worked around these secrets when

388
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,990
we start to talk about encryption keys

389
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,720
have theoretical lifetimes of hundreds

390
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,550
of thousands if not millions of years

391
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,220
well if I have information that is

392
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,349
statically protected by these keys I

393
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,060
should be able to define some type of

394
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,769
pattern about where is the information

395
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,050
being decrypted and where is it going

396
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:55,839
one of the fundamental things I try to

397
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,469
work with customers on is yes protect

398
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,690
your network

399
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,970
we don't want attackers coming into our

400
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:03,100
network buyed rather you define your

401
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,450
network as one that if somebody was on

402
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,220
your network there's nothing they can

403
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,079
really get to if you encrypt your

404
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,540
information if you protect your host and

405
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,519
protect your secrets I in theory could

406
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,589
have someone wandering around my network

407
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,380
and not have to worry about my data

408
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:19,360
being divulged now that takes a lot of

409
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,310
discipline a lot of effort but if you

410
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,779
build to that level you're not doing

411
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,719
this Twinkie approach have you have you

412
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:27,100
heard of the Twinkie security model if

413
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,500
you put all your protecting your

414
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,209
firewalls and all your antivirus and all

415
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,820
your SSL scanning on the perimeter your

416
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:36,219
network you breached that little soft

417
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:40,000
yellow leaf filling and you get the very

418
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,220
soft creamy center of that Twinkie if

419
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,140
you puncture that little exterior hole

420
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,630
there's nothing protect you once they

421
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,850
get inside if you start managing your

422
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,100
data where it's encrypted at all times

423
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,810
you're practicing defense and death

424
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,930
you're making sure that your secrets and

425
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:57,399
your data are protected the other thing

426
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,069
that we need to do is if we're going to

427
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,690
start managing our secrets is having a

428
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,419
plan of attack of what are we going to

429
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:07,410
do if one of our secrets or the data

430
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:10,870
that they protect has become compromised

431
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:13,329
inevitably there's going to be attacks

432
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:15,938
there's going to be loss of information

433
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:18,490
regardless of what you do one of the

434
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:20,890
challenges that we have is that we can

435
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,319
protect against the scenarios that we

436
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,699
can define it's the undefined scenarios

437
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,490
that we're not going to be prepared for

438
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,919
how many people in this room are kind of

439
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,140
your network or systems administrator or

440
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,730
cyber engineer like you have some role

441
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,770
in your organization when it comes to

442
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,210
security okay

443
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,120
everyone that just raise your hand

444
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,250
you're my worst nightmare because you

445
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,620
have your hands in all of these systems

446
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,670
do you know the passwords the systems

447
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,310
you've got the scanning systems

448
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:51,350
you are the ones that your organization

449
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,210
trusts but how do we make sure that

450
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,820
organizations aren't trusting the wrong

451
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:58,100
person a lot of organizations will say

452
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,320
well we've we trust our administrators

453
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,209
we've never had a problem okay what

454
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,770
about the next hire what about that next

455
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,350
person you bring in and they're gonna

456
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,340
have all the same access you do so some

457
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,480
of the things that we can do are

458
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,520
actually implementing things like

459
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,830
two-person integrity where certain types

460
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,930
of secrets can only be accessed if two

461
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,909
people are present so there are some

462
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,830
times where we have to define how are we

463
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:23,180
going to protect ourselves against

464
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:26,419
ourselves so trying to figure out where

465
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,310
our secrets are kept as I said there's

466
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,200
the application approach there's also

467
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:32,360
just looking in all the different

468
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,790
platforms that we are using in our

469
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,550
organizations to find where these keys

470
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:41,149
are at obviously there's the on-premises

471
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:42,830
our servers or applications our PCs

472
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,230
don't forget those things that are

473
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:48,189
outside of that central data center it's

474
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:51,410
not always just our server sitting in a

475
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,060
data center or sitting in a rack that we

476
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,890
can physically go up and touch and say I

477
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:58,250
have some type of data here some type of

478
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:00,050
encryption our user systems there's

479
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,840
often things throughout the organization

480
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:05,330
it has some type of data that needs to

481
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,669
be protected we all kind of have heard

482
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,199
stories about laptops that get stolen

483
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,480
and there's some spreadsheet that

484
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,400
somebody had downloaded information so

485
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,010
it's not just our main servers that have

486
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,810
this information now we have the

487
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:21,260
complexities of things like cloud and

488
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:23,750
managed services I've even had customers

489
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,310
where they have information that's kind

490
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,140
of not quite in either one its

491
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,179
on-premises but they don't own it and

492
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,860
they don't manage it so all of those

493
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,720
types of managed services where maybe

494
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,689
there's a third-party vendor that has

495
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,540
equipment or server or data sitting on

496
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,970
your network that has your secrets or

497
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:43,280
your data and main I may be something

498
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,540
that you're touching on a daily basis so

499
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,610
what are those other things that your

500
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,500
vendors or partners or solution

501
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:51,070
providers are putting in your facility

502
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,930
what types of information do they have

503
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,120
we obviously have things like flash

504
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:58,750
drives how many organizations have some

505
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,760
type of policy against flash drives

506
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:04,250
I'm seeing this more and more don't

507
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,110
bring the flash drive in if it tried to

508
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,450
plug in in we're not gonna recognize it

509
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,520
either a central flash drive you have to

510
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,710
take it to a central location cutting

511
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,020
off those types of places from an

512
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,520
organizational standpoint flash drives

513
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,960
are nice and convenient but usually

514
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:22,550
means informations going somewhere that

515
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:26,210
we can't track the other thing is encode

516
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,830
any developers in the room okay please

517
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:31,220
don't put secrets and passwords and

518
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:33,409
tokens and api's into your code I can't

519
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,390
see them I can't manage them and I don't

520
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:38,450
know they were there the other thing is

521
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:41,690
despite your best intentions they never

522
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:43,400
get updated in the next release I've

523
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,720
seen software people where people have

524
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,430
said you know what we're just gonna

525
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,590
change this every couple of weeks with a

526
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:51,470
new release it's never gonna matter and

527
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:53,750
then eventually that manufacturer either

528
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,820
ceases to update the product or a new

529
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,020
developer comes in and goes I don't want

530
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,270
to break anything so I'm not gonna

531
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:02,840
change all those old keys I'm gonna

532
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:05,450
leave them in there you cannot obscure

533
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:09,110
your code enough to make any secrets or

534
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:11,270
passwords safe inside of code if it's

535
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,149
statically defined somewhere someone's

536
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,950
gotta find it it also makes it very

537
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:19,220
difficult from a centralized management

538
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:23,480
if I want to increase or rotate Keys or

539
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:25,730
track those encryption tokens if it's

540
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,320
inside of your code and I'm not looking

541
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:33,470
at your code I may not even know it's

542
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:36,710
there so one of the challenges that we

543
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,780
often come up with is organizations that

544
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,250
say I get it we want to protect this

545
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,960
information we want to encrypt the

546
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,570
information I understand what you're

547
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:49,340
going for but I don't know how to do

548
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:51,080
this this is kind of your typical chart

549
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,300
for any type of project you could plug

550
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,429
in any name here you know the more

551
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,220
secure and the more robust it is the

552
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,380
more time the more cost you know the old

553
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,910
adage you can have it fast and secure

554
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,790
but it's not gonna be cheap and you can

555
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,470
take any - but you can't have all three

556
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,080
so from a project perspective you can

557
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,400
sit here you can graph this all out

558
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,790
here's what I really do with customers

559
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,620
ice

560
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,210
down and I say do you want to be the

561
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,399
carrot or do you want to be the stick

562
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,070
you have to make a decision or your

563
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,220
vendors going to drive your security in

564
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:24,230
your secrets management or do you define

565
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,660
them and what that comes back to is you

566
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,610
can say what can all of my existing

567
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,700
applications do and whatever they can

568
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:35,689
all do that's my security if they all

569
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:38,300
can provide sha-1 hashes and they have

570
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,740
passwords of eight lengths a character

571
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,379
link that must be the best security I

572
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:46,190
can do and pat myself on the back and I

573
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:49,250
move on or I take the other approach I

574
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:51,500
say let's define what I want my security

575
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:55,610
look like I want all of my applications

576
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,620
to be using X if you're gonna stick with

577
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:59,659
passwords you come up with your password

578
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,699
complexity if you're going to use PGP

579
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,230
you define what that complexity is if

580
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,450
you're going to use encryption and

581
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:07,340
private keys you define what that is and

582
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,830
you may not be able to tell your vendor

583
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:14,030
I want you to do this today but you set

584
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:17,240
your goal you say okay it's 2018 by 2021

585
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:19,760
I want all of my applications to meet

586
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,590
this standard you must be able to

587
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,110
support symmetric keys you must be able

588
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,389
to support whatever that is and you

589
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:28,159
define your vendors and you say if you

590
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:31,970
want to continue to sell your product to

591
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,860
us you have three years to meet this if

592
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:37,220
you can't meet this goal you will be

593
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:39,649
replaced so you may not even be able to

594
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:42,530
affect the security today but you can at

595
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:44,090
least define what that eventualities and

596
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,550
you may even have several tiers there

597
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,709
you may have that one year goal three

598
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,659
year goal five year goal then make sure

599
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,840
that's part of your organizational

600
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:56,390
approach if your organization that does

601
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,949
RFPs or some type of application

602
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,500
verification before you bring the

603
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:03,040
product in make sure that standard is in

604
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,810
there so if you expect to be using

605
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,580
sha-256 hashing for something

606
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:10,820
make sure that's part of your vendor

607
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:13,429
evaluation part of your your application

608
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,889
verification process and if it doesn't

609
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,050
say you failed that part either fix it

610
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:20,780
give us a commitment to do it or we're

611
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:23,480
gonna find another product so

612
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,730
organizations need to proactively define

613
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,350
what

614
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,750
they want their security to be 8 and you

615
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:30,139
can all do that it's a matter of is that

616
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,790
one year is that five years or ten years

617
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:35,010
obviously the less purchasing power you

618
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:37,260
have the smaller you are smaller your

619
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:40,920
budget you may have to have a longer

620
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:42,600
tail to get to that standard if you're a

621
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,370
large organization you can throw your

622
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,090
money around and go to organizations

623
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:50,010
like Amazon or Microsoft or sa P and say

624
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,919
if you want to continue in our

625
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:55,500
organization we have a two-year standard

626
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,720
you must be able to take all your

627
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:01,730
encryption keys and have them centrally

628
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,730
managed so you can define these things

629
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,770
so from a security perspective the other

630
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:10,740
thing that you can define is how

631
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:13,680
security you want this to be is this

632
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,240
going to be just a simple centralized

633
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,980
you're gonna take all those secrets all

634
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,020
those passwords and centralize them in

635
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,970
one place and not necessarily improve

636
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,100
upon the security but they're going to

637
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,680
be in an auditable location or do you

638
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,629
want to ramp this up a little bit so

639
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,850
from the limited access standpoint we're

640
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:32,370
really talking about how do we identify

641
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:35,730
these secrets and then somehow control

642
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:38,149
them anyone using things like LastPass

643
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:40,800
or other types of password faulting

644
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,810
scenarios so this is an example of kind

645
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,730
of limited access you can put all those

646
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:46,950
secrets in there not great for things

647
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,990
like encryption keys and API keys but

648
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:52,680
for passwords and you can somewhat

649
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:54,360
control that access so in that case

650
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:59,910
you're taking a lot of their secrets out

651
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:01,919
of those post-it notes and emails and no

652
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:04,350
text files are around and putting it in

653
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,550
someone of a controlled fashion doesn't

654
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,639
work for a lot of other types of

655
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:10,409
technologies the other option is we

656
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,500
start looking at how do we encrypt some

657
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:15,960
of these secrets how can we take our API

658
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:18,960
keys how can we take our symmetric keys

659
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,810
our passwords or tokens whatever we have

660
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,610
and encrypt them beyond just a password

661
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:25,830
manager this is going to take more

662
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:29,159
effort there are technologies out there

663
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:31,409
where we can manage this information but

664
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,700
if you think about LastPass or some

665
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,440
other type the password vaulting

666
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,720
scenario and you expand it to include

667
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,809
things that are than passwords

668
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,580
going along those lines the other thing

669
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,200
that we do is we can move beyond that

670
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,600
start looking at how we actually manage

671
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,520
these secrets how do we actually control

672
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,469
the changing of the secrets changing and

673
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,870
rolling of keys how do we actually

674
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,730
control access to them so if you've

675
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,309
looked at things like cyber-ark anyone

676
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:57,929
using cyber-ark

677
00:26:55,309 --> 00:27:00,090
okay okay you can see kind of a much

678
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:02,340
smaller subset if you don't know what

679
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,289
tools like cyber-ark are these are ones

680
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,860
where people don't even have access to

681
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:09,179
the secrets LastPass you put the

682
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,770
password in there if you want it you

683
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,750
could look at it you can copy out you

684
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,210
can all that fill some form you see the

685
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,190
password you can divulge it things like

686
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:20,220
cyber-ark you don't even see the

687
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,740
password you connect into a server well

688
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,500
you actually go to cyber-ark cyber-ark

689
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:28,260
signs into the server for you you never

690
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:32,460
see it so there are ways of increasing

691
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:34,710
the security of that information so a

692
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,140
couple things that we need to watch for

693
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:39,330
when we talk about why do we want to be

694
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,260
concerned about secrets management or if

695
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,480
you're going to go back to your

696
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,520
organization how do you convince someone

697
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,010
that you should spend the time tracking

698
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,110
these applications down managing the

699
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,840
passwords why is it worth that

700
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:54,928
investment the problems that we run into

701
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,370
is when we start looking at accounts or

702
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:58,440
our networks getting compromised

703
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,850
ultimately means there's something on

704
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,630
our network or something about our

705
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:06,570
organization that can get divulged if

706
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:08,370
you're an organization perhaps like a

707
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,100
university where you dis let anyone

708
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,600
connect in odds are there's still parts

709
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,280
of your network that you don't want

710
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,600
people getting to you're always going to

711
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,570
have something that you don't want

712
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,100
compromised is anyone in an organization

713
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:24,418
where you don't care who looks at what I

714
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:27,000
mean like anyone not usually the case

715
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:30,150
most of the time when we were put

716
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,159
together as even a cooperative or an

717
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,510
education institution there's still

718
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,299
something that we need to keep away from

719
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:38,970
other people so when we have poor

720
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:42,960
management of those secrets passwords

721
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:45,390
encryption keys we face divulging that

722
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,549
information we have things like data

723
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,990
breaches and outages now this moves

724
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:51,080
beyond just in from

725
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,160
it's been divulged it means our

726
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,470
organization perhaps isn't even able to

727
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,929
function we're down for a period of time

728
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,900
we can't function as a business we can't

729
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:03,510
have bank tellers working students can't

730
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:07,679
get onto online courses it affects us

731
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:10,080
materially it also has a direct cost you

732
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,160
have to go fix it if you're one of those

733
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,629
people that said you're part of the

734
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,640
security team guess what you get to do

735
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,220
on the weekend you get to go in and fix

736
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,309
this so there's a direct cost to not

737
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,630
doing this and this is one where

738
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:24,120
organizations will often time take the

739
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,980
short-sighted approach they'll say well

740
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,320
it's gonna cost me X dollars to go out

741
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,059
and buy something it's gonna cost me X

742
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,800
dollars for you to go out and inventory

743
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:34,260
all these systems and then we're gonna

744
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,820
go out and spend five thousand twenty

745
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,679
thousand fifty a hundred thousand

746
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,340
dollars on something to manage this

747
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,929
there you go I'm not worried about that

748
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:45,240
but what's the cost when there is an

749
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:48,030
outage like what happens on a per minute

750
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,700
basis and some organizations this is a

751
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,350
real easy calculation you go to Amazon

752
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,210
and they could probably tell you each

753
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:56,969
second that their site doesn't function

754
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:59,490
they lose X dollars so that becomes a

755
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:04,770
real easy metric hey if I can buy a

756
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:06,390
solution that we can estimate saves us X

757
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,820
amount of time or prevents a certain

758
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:11,400
type of outage then it's worth the

759
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,200
investment that's much harder and other

760
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,670
types of organizations but that's one

761
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,940
way of kind of positioning these types

762
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:22,800
of technologies the other one loss of

763
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:25,320
reputation any one I don't want to say

764
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,899
track but the story about Symantec

765
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,570
Verisign so

766
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:33,480
Symantec years ago bought Verisign

767
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:37,379
Verisign being a certificate issuer in

768
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:40,950
the public internet space Symantec

769
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:43,110
Verisign didn't necessarily have theft

770
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,390
of their secrets but they had a big

771
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:47,280
impact in reputation they were found to

772
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,900
be issuing certificates they shouldn't

773
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,910
and it's not the first company that's

774
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,830
ever been caught this way but from a

775
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:55,050
reputation standpoint if you think about

776
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:58,470
things like certificates in the public

777
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:01,200
space their only business is selling a

778
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,669
reputation if you trust Symantec

779
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,970
Verisign then you trust every

780
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:08,490
certificate the issue in their case

781
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:11,010
they'd lost their reputation and that

782
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,690
business essentially went bankrupt now I

783
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:16,220
got bought by digi cert and got turned

784
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:19,710
into the the the digi cert portion of

785
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:22,200
certificates but the net result is the

786
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:26,610
same most of us if you suffer a strong

787
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:30,570
enough risk excuse me if you suffer the

788
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:32,158
loss of information or have a outage

789
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,769
that is significant enough to affect

790
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,600
your reputation some organizations can

791
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:39,120
cease the function many of them will be

792
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:44,668
able to recover but there again is a

793
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:46,199
cost to the impact to that reputation so

794
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:50,700
a couple of things that you can do as

795
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,889
far as centralizing your secrets one is

796
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,779
try to figure out how you can define

797
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:57,750
some type of private centralized

798
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:59,639
repository once you know what those

799
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,620
applications are what types of secrets

800
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:03,719
you have in your environment whether

801
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,760
they're just passwords encryption keys

802
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,220
api's once you know what those things

803
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,010
are there is probably some type of

804
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,889
centralized technology that you can use

805
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:16,139
to protect that and I'm going to share a

806
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:18,840
few different options for you but

807
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:21,750
bringing those together is going to be

808
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,850
that limited access scenario the

809
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,620
LastPass analogy if we can at least

810
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:31,049
bring them together we can control

811
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:32,399
access to it we can restrict access into

812
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,200
those privates in a number of different

813
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,000
ways when we talk about things like

814
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,539
cyber arc if we're going to be

815
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,029
protecting passwords by eliminating the

816
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:44,220
human element of seeing the passwords we

817
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:45,419
can even control the fact that in order

818
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,639
to get on cyber arc you have to have

819
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:49,620
two-factor or maybe phone factor we're

820
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:51,240
going to increase the identity

821
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,070
protection of who's getting to the

822
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,250
secret and then how they're using the

823
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,840
secret the other one and this is one

824
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,269
that comes up quite a bit and a lot of

825
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,879
organizations overlook this separate

826
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:05,100
your data and your secrets your data and

827
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,799
your encryption keys do not look to

828
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:10,799
things like AWS and Azure and say oh

829
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:12,170
they can host my data and I can put my

830
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,629
key up there somehow

831
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:17,690
one way or the other that's going to get

832
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:20,000
affected I am still an advocate today

833
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:22,850
that says if you want to put data up in

834
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,179
AWS great encrypt the heck out of it

835
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:29,000
keep the key in your control now things

836
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:31,280
like a sure they have some options for

837
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,580
different technologies to have key Balt

838
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,010
they also have options where you can

839
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,270
bring your own key has anyone heard of

840
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,480
bring your own key for different

841
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:43,010
scenarios so bring your own key this is

842
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,710
where you create some type of an

843
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:47,540
encryption key on your premises either

844
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:50,950
in a piece of hardware or a piece of

845
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:54,260
software the key is in your possession

846
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:56,780
the data that is encrypting can be

847
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:58,850
stored wherever you would like rather

848
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:01,190
than relying on that manufacturer or

849
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:04,100
that provider to generate and store the

850
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:06,290
key for you now that key and the data

851
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,418
are in the same place and only takes one

852
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:12,649
miss configuration for that key to be

853
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:14,658
divulged so Microsoft's got a number of

854
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:16,009
solutions around bring your own key when

855
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:17,659
you look to different technology

856
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,810
providers see if they have some type of

857
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:23,810
bring your own key solution protect the

858
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,909
key on your own site the other thing is

859
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,879
think about how your data is going to be

860
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:33,200
encrypted ideally we want that encrypted

861
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:35,540
at all times a lot of providers and

862
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,850
software will simply say yes you can

863
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,409
encrypt the data but what does that mean

864
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,509
are they encrypting it just when the

865
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:43,490
system is running is it just encrypted

866
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,149
at rest is it encrypted just on the

867
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,859
drive

868
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,839
what about how the data gets moved from

869
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:49,429
one place to the other because remember

870
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,440
it's not just the data that they're

871
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:53,540
going to be moving but if they're using

872
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,639
your API tokens or other pieces of

873
00:34:53,540 --> 00:35:00,800
secret information how is that getting

874
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:02,210
moved from one place to the other the

875
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,390
other things that we have here is

876
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:07,670
thinking about administrative and

877
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:10,310
Technology Solutions what I mean by this

878
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,690
is there's a technology way of

879
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,759
approaching these things and then

880
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,920
there's an administrative one one I'm

881
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,720
not a fan of writing policies that say

882
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,640
don't do stupid things with secrets and

883
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,410
passwords people that are going to do

884
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,250
stupid things with them are not going to

885
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:26,589
be following your policy one I have

886
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:28,570
a firm belief that human beings have an

887
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,160
innate way of finding the simplest way

888
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:33,580
of defeating anything that you come up

889
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:36,490
with the post-it note password is a

890
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:39,310
great example of this how do I get

891
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:41,439
around my IT department making me do my

892
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,420
password on a regular basis and this is

893
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,530
not a new thing with passwords that are

894
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:49,510
complex in 16 characters 30 years ago

895
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:51,760
people were still doing post-its now it

896
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,380
was piece paper and scotch tape but it

897
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,920
was still a way of how do I remember

898
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,510
this information human beings and I see

899
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,940
this even in organizations where we

900
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:03,250
define a very strong security posture

901
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,720
around a PKI two people are going to be

902
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:06,550
present there's going to be an auditor

903
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,089
there's gonna be a camera and they are

904
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:11,800
on top of their game a day we deploy

905
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:14,500
come back a year later two years later

906
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,390
they have found every possible way to

907
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,490
stick to the letter of the law but not

908
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:21,069
quite really be doing what they need to

909
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:22,660
do auditors that come in they're

910
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:24,460
supposed to be supervising people and

911
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:27,580
what they're doing or playing candy

912
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:30,370
crush on their phone are they present

913
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,960
yeah did they sign a log that says that

914
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:34,750
those people were there yeah did they

915
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,000
actually watch what was going on yeah it

916
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,970
was any value so people will innately

917
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,680
just find the easiest way that's why we

918
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:44,500
have software to prevent people from

919
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,240
rolling passwords you make me change my

920
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,560
password every 90 days what am I gonna

921
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,509
do I'm just gonna go back and forth

922
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,240
between the two passwords so you find

923
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:54,670
some way of preventing that so humans

924
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,919
have a great way of finding out what is

925
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,110
the simplest way I can do something so

926
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,970
there is not going to be a comprehensive

927
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,740
way where you can say I can expect my

928
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:05,799
people to always be on the top of their

929
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:08,410
game every time so for the most part I

930
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,270
don't want to put the burden of this on

931
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:12,399
to people and say your responsibility

932
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:15,190
you have to keep this information secure

933
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,570
so for me if I'm going to give it a

934
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,400
responsibility or I'm going to give you

935
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:20,770
access to there I need to verify that

936
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,780
the old trust but verify I need to

937
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,090
actually make sure that this information

938
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,130
isn't being sent around so I've got all

939
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:29,800
my passwords and all my keys in one

940
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,360
place go take a look at the audit lock

941
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,920
who's looking at this what are they

942
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,260
doing with it where's that information

943
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,700
going so you can't just assume that

944
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,250
because you've centralized it that the

945
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,770
problems gone away

946
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,319
the other options is think about how are

947
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:46,809
you going to secure that centralized

948
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:49,029
repository if this is something you're

949
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:51,099
building yourself how are you going to

950
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:53,200
protect access to that if you're

951
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:55,329
building a repository work all your

952
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,859
passwords are for the organization but

953
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:59,140
you let people use their password to get

954
00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:01,359
to the repository that's not a very

955
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:03,220
strong way of going about so I try to

956
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,259
think about things of if I'm going to be

957
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,328
protecting information how do I protect

958
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:11,380
it at least at that same level or higher

959
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:13,900
than what's in there so a couple of

960
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:16,809
things that you can look at today so

961
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,250
things that you could go out to protect

962
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:20,319
the secrets in your organization so

963
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,990
obviously being the PKI guy I'm a fan of

964
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:24,549
PKI so public key infrastructure we can

965
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,200
do things like identity and data

966
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:28,509
encryption we can move away from

967
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,490
passwords we can encrypt information we

968
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:32,530
can get people onto identities are

969
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:35,979
protected with things like UV keys or

970
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:38,710
TPM chips we can make a stronger set of

971
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,690
secrets that can't be compromised or at

972
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,039
least not as easily start looking at

973
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,619
things like password vault so move

974
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:46,390
beyond just password managers now I

975
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:48,400
didn't catch the whole last talk but

976
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,859
things like LastPass can do some very

977
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,210
basic no password audits and tell you

978
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:54,190
that someone's got a four character

979
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:56,650
password and hasn't been changed for a

980
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:59,049
while but move beyond that moving into

981
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:02,380
some of these vaulting solutions where

982
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:04,029
the passwords aren't exposed now what's

983
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,799
nice about this is when you rely on

984
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:07,750
something like a cyber-ark or some of

985
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:09,670
their vault because there's no human

986
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,279
element you're not setting the password

987
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,960
you can tell cyber-ark for instance I

988
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:17,890
want you to roll this key every day I

989
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:19,599
want to be 255 characters since no one's

990
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:22,750
actually having to interact with it and

991
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,260
copy and paste it and no change that

992
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,299
process

993
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,660
it's all happening behind the scenes you

994
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:30,369
can have much stronger security but as

995
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,690
in my previous slide make sure you know

996
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,730
how you're protecting access to the

997
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,230
cyber vault

998
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:37,869
if that's going to contain all of the

999
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:39,460
keys to your organization make sure that

1000
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:42,099
that's stronger than anything else that

1001
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,720
you're doing the other things that you

1002
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:45,819
can look at key management systems or

1003
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,669
kms is becoming a stronger and stronger

1004
00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:50,558
player in the market there's products

1005
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,840
from companies like blur metric that's

1006
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,410
now

1007
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:56,390
part of Talas symmetric-key management

1008
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:58,009
is what these are designed to do so

1009
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,870
rather than having all of these

1010
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:01,070
passwords and symmetric keys for

1011
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,810
different applications and different

1012
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:05,060
encryptions scattered throughout the

1013
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:07,370
organization they all get vaulted in one

1014
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,110
place when an application like sequel

1015
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,580
needs decrypt information or some

1016
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,620
application needs to create something

1017
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,750
else they check out their key from the

1018
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,490
kms system they can do whatever they

1019
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:19,040
need to do and get to check back in

1020
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:20,839
again now the downside is you have to

1021
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,430
have a kms solution that integrates with

1022
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,200
whatever your products are so you kind

1023
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:26,600
of go back to the inventory again

1024
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,730
what has the symmetric keys what needs

1025
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,950
to be protected how am I going to go

1026
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:32,810
about doing that but now by having all

1027
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:35,270
of those keys centralized I can define

1028
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:38,029
minimum standards do I want a EES

1029
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:39,800
encryption symmetric keys what size how

1030
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:42,200
often are they rotated who's getting

1031
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,560
access how do I add it and determine

1032
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:48,169
where that data is or other things

1033
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,270
things like our databases looking at

1034
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:53,240
more than just saying okay I bit Lockard

1035
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:55,910
my my database or at least my database

1036
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:59,240
disk I must be done there are other

1037
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:01,790
types of encryption that are possible

1038
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,430
things like TDE and always encrypted

1039
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:07,070
where the data is encrypted even in the

1040
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:08,750
processing space of sequel server so

1041
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:11,270
there are applications now where the

1042
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,230
database at the the table level is

1043
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:15,620
encrypted

1044
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:17,480
whenever the service is running it's

1045
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,730
kept encrypted in the memory space all

1046
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,320
the functionality is an encrypted memory

1047
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,630
which means even if you were able to

1048
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,840
blue screen and dump the contents of a

1049
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:29,210
server all that data is protected so

1050
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,820
things like the heartbleed exploit a few

1051
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:33,770
years ago with open SSL same type of

1052
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,220
thing if the keys or the data is in

1053
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,400
memory

1054
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,410
there's the possible disclosure of that

1055
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,810
so always encrypted means we can move

1056
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,310
away from those models the other things

1057
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:46,100
that you can look at are as your key

1058
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:49,310
vault it doesn't work for every solution

1059
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:52,040
but with microsoft key vault your keys

1060
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:55,520
can be protected in a virtual HSM if you

1061
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:58,190
will or a hardware product at Microsoft

1062
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,200
not every application they have will

1063
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,480
integrate with it but it's certainly

1064
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,040
better than putting your encryption keys

1065
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,100
or other types of C

1066
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,960
sitting on the blob or just on a server

1067
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:12,259
itself they can be checked into the key

1068
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,260
vault Microsoft rights management server

1069
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,880
for instance it uses key Balt but it

1070
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,410
actually has that bring your own key

1071
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,710
scenario

1072
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:24,080
so with RMS if you're protecting office

1073
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:26,330
documents and email you can actually

1074
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,069
generate your own key on a hardware

1075
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,140
security module and then that key is

1076
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:36,190
transported to Microsoft into the key

1077
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:39,140
vault not my biggest recommendation

1078
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:42,460
having data and keys in the same place

1079
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:45,319
but if you have no choice so one of the

1080
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:48,250
other things I'll leave you with is the

1081
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,810
fact that all of these security things

1082
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:53,330
are very easy to kind of paint in black

1083
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:54,590
and white terms the approach I often

1084
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:57,230
take with customers is we have to be

1085
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:59,630
pragmatic about all associated with some

1086
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:01,310
type of an organization or a business it

1087
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:03,590
has to be worthwhile to that

1088
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:05,090
organization to do something we can't

1089
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,410
just define something as black and white

1090
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,900
this is the right way of doing it it's

1091
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:11,420
the wrong way security is often

1092
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:13,520
associated with some type of a risk and

1093
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:15,560
we're trying to mitigate that risk and

1094
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,440
we can deploy a technology we can put a

1095
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:20,810
process in place we can manage who can

1096
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,780
get access to that information but

1097
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:26,060
sometimes our risks are simply mitigated

1098
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:28,250
by accepting them and I'm a firm

1099
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,680
believer in that technology is great and

1100
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:32,840
process is great but sometimes it's just

1101
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,810
a matter of being able to say yes we're

1102
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:37,880
aware of the risk and we accept the risk

1103
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:39,770
it's when you don't know that you've

1104
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,780
accepted the risk that you're running to

1105
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:43,610
the biggest problems so if you didn't

1106
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,490
realize that having your keys and your

1107
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:48,260
data in the cloud or an application had

1108
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:50,810
its secret embedded in the code you

1109
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,790
didn't have that full recognition of

1110
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,340
what that risk was you didn't have all

1111
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:57,110
the information to be able to make that

1112
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,550
decision so I'd much rather it be

1113
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:01,880
something where the organization says

1114
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:03,470
yes we're aware of it either from a

1115
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,330
financial standpoint or a risk

1116
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,569
standpoint we're not going to do

1117
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:11,029
anything about it but we're aware of it

1118
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:14,380
so that's what I have for you today you

1119
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,380
questions I can answer for you

1120
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:54,039
and so the way I often frame that

1121
00:44:51,729 --> 00:44:55,779
question is now how do we what are the

1122
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:57,939
best practices around kind of protecting

1123
00:44:55,779 --> 00:45:00,400
those identities or certificates on

1124
00:44:57,939 --> 00:45:01,419
something often times it kind of goes

1125
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,659
back to what I was just talking about

1126
00:45:01,419 --> 00:45:06,400
this what what risk am i concerned about

1127
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:08,349
and an analogy that I use with

1128
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,359
organizations is Alice in the Wonderland

1129
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:12,609
is I kind of start talking about risks

1130
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:14,229
and we kind of go down this this rabbit

1131
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:15,549
hole and we kind of start talking about

1132
00:45:14,229 --> 00:45:17,499
are you concerned about this are you

1133
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:19,029
concerned about that so in the case of

1134
00:45:17,499 --> 00:45:20,828
your wireless scenario for instance I

1135
00:45:19,029 --> 00:45:22,779
would say are you concerned about no a

1136
00:45:20,829 --> 00:45:24,489
laptop gang stolen and somebody may be

1137
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:26,199
getting on your Wi-Fi network okay

1138
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:28,479
you're concerned about that we go down

1139
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:30,549
the rabbit hole what about someone

1140
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:32,019
deliberately taking a laptop to get on

1141
00:45:30,549 --> 00:45:32,979
your network very different then

1142
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:34,598
something goes missing

1143
00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:36,279
and someone accidentally gets on the

1144
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,529
network the other one is corporate

1145
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:40,239
espionage eventually you get down that

1146
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:42,099
rabbit hole it's aliens beaming

1147
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,869
information out of your brain and you go

1148
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:46,119
okay mark that's a little far and you

1149
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:47,709
back up the rabbit hole and you go okay

1150
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,959
here's all the risks that we were

1151
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:52,419
concerned about how do we address those

1152
00:45:49,959 --> 00:45:54,819
so in your case if we are talking about

1153
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:57,519
mobile devices getting onto a Wi-Fi

1154
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:59,799
network if I have a deliberate concern

1155
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:01,689
about something I may choose to say how

1156
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:04,269
am I going to protect that is it going

1157
00:46:01,689 --> 00:46:07,328
to be just short-lived certificates that

1158
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:11,258
are changed on a regular basis if I'm

1159
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:12,819
concerned about somebody for instance it

1160
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:16,089
could be I don't want my employees

1161
00:46:12,819 --> 00:46:17,319
bringing their iPads to the office and

1162
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:18,669
taking the certificate off of a

1163
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:21,189
corporate machine and putting on their

1164
00:46:18,669 --> 00:46:22,509
iPad to get on the Wi-Fi okay I can just

1165
00:46:21,189 --> 00:46:24,189
make sure that their key can't be

1166
00:46:22,509 --> 00:46:27,489
exported so maybe it's sitting inside of

1167
00:46:24,189 --> 00:46:29,949
a TPM chip so very different scenarios

1168
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:32,289
will kind of drive what am I going to do

1169
00:46:29,949 --> 00:46:36,050
to mitigate that risk some of them maybe

1170
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:37,910
I can't do anything about it it's not

1171
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:39,590
for instance going out and deploying

1172
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:41,450
smart cards for everyone so there's

1173
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:44,660
going to be scales for each type of

1174
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:47,210
thing so I look at as every certificate

1175
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:50,330
has a key that secret how do I need to

1176
00:46:47,210 --> 00:47:01,240
protect that key and from what sir so

1177
00:46:50,330 --> 00:47:05,480
some organizations exactly yeah exactly

1178
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:07,629
exactly yeah exactly and Windows you

1179
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,950
know and and that's a great example of

1180
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,690
defining what my risk is because for

1181
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:13,399
some organizations and that's a question

1182
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,680
that comes up quite a bit

1183
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,510
for some of them it simply is that I pad

1184
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,730
I don't want my employee bringing an

1185
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:22,910
iPad or their home laptop onto the Wi-Fi

1186
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:24,890
now I just want to make it difficult for

1187
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,899
them to do that well windows I could say

1188
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:28,460
that private keys not exportable now I

1189
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,200
will tell you I have a piece of software

1190
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,780
sitting on this machine that ignores

1191
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:34,460
that key or that flag and will let you

1192
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,680
export any key that's protected by

1193
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:38,240
Windows but for that casual employee

1194
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,250
who's trying to get the laptop on and

1195
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,790
that option to export the key is greyed

1196
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:43,520
out

1197
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:50,860
I've mitigated that risk a deliberate

1198
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:50,860
attacker no not so much other questions

1199
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:54,309
as yes

1200
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:30,609
yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly so so so

1201
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:33,369
this is one where sometimes it's a

1202
00:48:30,609 --> 00:48:36,009
technology solution of if I am set with

1203
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:38,800
I've got something that I need to expose

1204
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:41,770
and I'm going to need to be able to

1205
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,570
connect to it and I'm going to obviously

1206
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:46,380
want it to authenticate but how do I

1207
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:48,940
keep other people from authenticating

1208
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:50,590
this is kind of going back to different

1209
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:52,180
types of Secrets now obviously we have

1210
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:54,880
things like passwords and there's

1211
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:57,910
symmetric encryption yeah or symmetric

1212
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:03,730
keys one of the nice things is know why

1213
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:06,069
I do a lot in the PKI space is that's a

1214
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:08,380
great example of how can you attend ik 8

1215
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:11,170
and secure information well actually

1216
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:13,690
sending secret information so the great

1217
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:16,270
thing about PKI or frankly things like

1218
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:18,130
cybervault or other technologies is the

1219
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,960
fact that I can authenticate I don't

1220
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:21,790
care who's listening because I'm not

1221
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,220
gonna send you anything secret but yet I

1222
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:25,810
can have a very strong identity and very

1223
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,118
strong access to whatever I'm trying to

1224
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:30,310
get now the challenge is often you talk

1225
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:32,859
about the mobile device how do I do that

1226
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:35,410
on a mobile device and it's been a

1227
00:49:32,859 --> 00:49:37,569
changing story historically it's been

1228
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:39,940
your beer out a lock when a mobile

1229
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:41,109
device the military had issues for a

1230
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:43,420
long time they had something called a

1231
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:46,359
kak sled which was basically like a

1232
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,970
really thick phone case and they could

1233
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:51,609
put their smart card into this case to

1234
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:54,790
read their identity a cat card is really

1235
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:56,710
just a PKI smart card you can start

1236
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:59,800
looking at things now Yubikey if you've

1237
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:02,800
heard of Yubikey they have now a NFC

1238
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:06,430
capable Yubikey which means now I can

1239
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:09,280
have either a one-time password or a PKI

1240
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:11,470
issued identity and key sitting on a

1241
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,040
flash drive and all I have to do is hold

1242
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:16,629
it up and via Bluetooth and NFC that

1243
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,430
information can be shared I don't need

1244
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:20,980
to worry about the form factor than

1245
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:23,589
connecting to so there are some newer

1246
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,150
technologies that enable that

1247
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:27,910
mobile scenario a lot of people are

1248
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:30,249
faced with how do i implement strong

1249
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:42,640
identities without killing mobile

1250
00:50:30,249 --> 00:50:44,109
devices yes exactly exactly exactly so

1251
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,910
now with that Yubikey I can go to a

1252
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:47,469
laptop I can go to a physical machine I

1253
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:50,078
can go to a server I can hold it near my

1254
00:50:47,469 --> 00:50:52,029
phone same identity the information

1255
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,549
that's transferred if I'm doing

1256
00:50:52,029 --> 00:50:56,499
PKI based certificates I'm descending my

1257
00:50:54,549 --> 00:50:57,279
certificate improving possession of the

1258
00:50:56,499 --> 00:51:01,348
private key

1259
00:50:57,279 --> 00:51:01,349
nothing sensitive is actually sent

1260
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:18,069
yeah so there I would say that some of

1261
00:51:16,299 --> 00:51:21,279
those problems exist even in physical

1262
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:23,170
environments of how do I rotate things

1263
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:24,999
when I've got potentially two or more

1264
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:27,450
hosts that are dependent on them or

1265
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:30,249
maybe the physical versus virtual

1266
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:32,200
frankly there's a technology that's been

1267
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:34,269
around for a long time inside of Windows

1268
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,578
for instance that a lot of people still

1269
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:40,089
don't leverage to this day things like

1270
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:42,220
managed service accounts so historically

1271
00:51:40,089 --> 00:51:43,900
when we wanted an application or service

1272
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,249
to run on Windows we created an

1273
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,200
application account we give it the

1274
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:48,759
permissions we get a password well go

1275
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,319
we'll be really good we'll change the

1276
00:51:48,759 --> 00:51:52,029
password on a regular basis but we never

1277
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,680
do because we got to stop it we got to

1278
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:55,809
go where it's at managed service

1279
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,430
accounts kind of turned out on its head

1280
00:51:55,809 --> 00:51:59,680
where it's now Active Directory that

1281
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:02,109
manages this service account a lot like

1282
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,910
a computer account so the computer gets

1283
00:52:02,109 --> 00:52:05,319
assigned hey this is a managed service

1284
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:07,839
account change the password on a regular

1285
00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:08,950
basis and it updates the service now if

1286
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:11,170
you've got multiple computers or

1287
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:12,700
multiple virtual machines they came out

1288
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,170
with group managed service accounts so

1289
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,390
there are starting to become newer

1290
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:18,309
technologies where now I could say this

1291
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:20,230
service account and it's secret being

1292
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:22,739
its password is on twelve different

1293
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:25,900
machines and they need to get rotated in

1294
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:27,220
the synchronously while group managed

1295
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,900
service accounts are one way of doing

1296
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:31,589
that other things

1297
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:33,579
products like cyber-ark enable a

1298
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:35,349
centralized place to say you know what

1299
00:52:33,579 --> 00:52:37,779
I'm going to have 12 different

1300
00:52:35,349 --> 00:52:40,150
identities and at some interval I'm

1301
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:42,460
gonna go out automatically and update

1302
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:44,349
those identities the administrator just

1303
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,299
interfaces with a cyber-ark for instance

1304
00:52:44,349 --> 00:52:48,279
so there's kind of different ways of

1305
00:52:46,299 --> 00:52:50,288
approaching that and oftentimes it's

1306
00:52:48,279 --> 00:52:52,599
driven by what is that application or

1307
00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:54,940
that operating system but it does kind

1308
00:52:52,599 --> 00:53:01,380
of go back to how do I rotate and keep

1309
00:52:54,940 --> 00:53:01,380
