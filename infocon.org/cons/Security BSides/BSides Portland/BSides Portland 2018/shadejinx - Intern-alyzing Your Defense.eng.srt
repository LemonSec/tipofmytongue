1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:25,419
okay hi I'm Justin I work for a local

2
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:27,430
company it's not super important but

3
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:30,669
over the past few months I have been

4
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,320
able to partake in two of the most

5
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:34,870
fulfilling things I've ever done in my

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,180
information security career I'm here to

7
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:45,069
tell you about one of them spoiler alert

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:46,899
it's about cyber education in April I

9
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,489
heard about a talk by a guy named Tobin

10
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:52,300
shields who's sitting here in the front

11
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:53,589
row he gave a talk about cyber education

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,998
at our company and I didn't get to

13
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:57,100
attend the talk I just got the slides

14
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:58,480
for it and I went through the slides and

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,629
I thought this is something that is very

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,420
very important the pipeline for

17
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:08,080
information security personnel are it's

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,180
it's drying up cyber education is not as

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,429
popular as we'd like to think it is a

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,159
lot of it has to do with some of the the

21
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:21,490
culture a lot of ask to do with the the

22
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:24,700
job situation but the education that

23
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,919
does exist tends to focus on threat

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,420
research in academia you go to a

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,180
four-year institution you learn how to

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,890
stay in a four-year institution but

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,409
there's such thing as blue collar jobs

28
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:38,259
in the information security field how

29
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:39,759
many people here defend a company raise

30
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:42,460
your hand how many people are on-call

31
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,770
sometimes Believe It or Not you are the

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:50,639
blue collar of the information security

33
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:52,899
field and you are underserved by the

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,689
community at large by the infrastructure

35
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:57,850
for education and by conferences and

36
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:59,919
this is why I'm super excited that track

37
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,259
B is all dedicated to cyber education

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,329
and defense this year this is a not a

39
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:06,130
first for B sides but it's it's a long

40
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,750
time coming and we should give a round

41
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,769
of applause to the B sides crew for

42
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,100
putting this together because this is

43
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,100
awesome

44
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:21,780
so why why is education targeting attack

45
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,650
research and academia because defense

46
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,650
isn't sexy

47
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,670
we are underrepresented at conferences

48
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,019
because the things that we do aren't

49
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,179
sexy they're not going to get headlines

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:41,010
you write policies you do risk analysis

51
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:44,970
you write firewall rules you don't talk

52
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,679
about you don't have fancy names for the

53
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,660
things you do and icons for the things

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,120
you do the training you get is either on

55
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,070
the job or the training you get is from

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
some certification authority that you

57
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,880
have to pay an annual maintenance fee

58
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,850
from academia is failing you so in May

59
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,319
after listening to Tobin's talk in May

60
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,430
my boss Steve Mann seen and I sat down

61
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,929
in a coffee shop with a local

62
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,730
organization called there now called in

63
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,670
for all they used to be called back the

64
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,310
business education Compaq they're an

65
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,059
organization that puts together

66
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:22,950
internships for underserved education

67
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,310
educational institutions high schools

68
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,700
and colleges mostly every every almost

69
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,070
every intern I've ever dealt with at

70
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,140
Intel and at my current employer silence

71
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,180
has been from the Beck and they've all

72
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,000
been fantastic and the Beck is fantastic

73
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,790
to work from because it's not you don't

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,280
have to go through your intern

75
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,600
procedures at your job you hire them as

76
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,430
contractors you go through your

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,940
contractor procedures and you get

78
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,410
interns at a low rate to do jobs for you

79
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,299
and their long-term interns they're not

80
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,440
just for the summer we have one of them

81
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,040
sitting here in the front row so I'm

82
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,040
gonna call him out

83
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,450
why did you get so we sat down and I

84
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,970
thought - we thought to ourselves we

85
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,250
should get Tobin and his cybersecurity

86
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,390
program in touch with the BEC to put

87
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,160
together internships for cybersecurity

88
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,738
students so we can generate a pipeline

89
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,520
from high school to internship to

90
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:27,000
college to job and they were talking

91
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,169
about doing something in around 2019 hey

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,900
we can get something for you the summer

93
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:33,300
of 2019 and here comes the first curse

94
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,900
of the night I've got I need to get

95
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,770
done now so we started talking about it

96
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,810
and the I'm talking about is

97
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:46,109
controls testing what is controls

98
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,330
testing controls testing is just one of

99
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,310
those things on a list of a never-ending

100
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,469
list that you have to do it's usually

101
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,450
only done once when you put the control

102
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,190
in place and then you count on your red

103
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,469
team's or your vulnerability test to do

104
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,940
it and they can't do it red team is by

105
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,650
their very nature can't test every

106
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,170
control in your environment and

107
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,760
vulnerability scans often don't don't go

108
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,070
deep enough so you need to do these

109
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,539
controls tests on your own but no one

110
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:14,969
ever does them because it's just another

111
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:17,300
thing to do I are our Enterprise put

112
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,630
several controls in place to protect

113
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:24,210
domain administrators it's a very hot

114
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:28,890
button topic of mine I'm kind of good at

115
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:30,120
it I'd like to think I am and but I put

116
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,760
these controls in place and we weren't

117
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,120
seeing any results no either no one was

118
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,650
pinging domain administrator or my

119
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,100
controls weren't working and I wasn't

120
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,530
sure which was which so the goal was I

121
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,570
need to test these controls I need to

122
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,979
make sure that they're working and those

123
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,500
controls I put in place were against

124
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:57,470
four very specific tools we can go into

125
00:05:49,500 --> 00:06:03,680
that later how do I get these things

126
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:06,710
tested purple teaming purple slide

127
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,389
I like purple teaming I think purple

128
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,340
teaming is a better way to go about

129
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:13,190
testing your security controls than red

130
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,469
teaming and adversarial approaches

131
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,870
because adversarial approaches to

132
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,240
testing security controls only tests

133
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,150
your security and your knowledge at that

134
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,860
particular point and any gaps in that

135
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,020
knowledge don't come out until the very

136
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,430
end and if you analyze the data you have

137
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,990
to rely on the red teamers to take

138
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,600
Goodenough notes for you to analyze that

139
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,280
data so you can improve purple teaming

140
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,380
means that your red team and blue team

141
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,609
work together that means both of them

142
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,440
are learning and growing at the same

143
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,419
time they work off one another they

144
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,699
learn from one another and during the

145
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:47,930
course of the event both of them gain in

146
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:52,280
skills so I prefer purple teaming so

147
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,740
between May and mid-july I hated

148
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,888
controls testing we got this internship

149
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:06,740
developed with the ion controls testing

150
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:10,430
funded and staffed by the end of July we

151
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,470
got in this program we got two students

152
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,979
and two instructors to come and sit with

153
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,930
me and test these controls out the

154
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:20,539
program was designed around four tools

155
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:24,440
I wanted the interns to use responder

156
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:29,389
PowerShell empire bloodhound and was the

157
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:31,610
last one to open maybe cats over the

158
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:33,139
course of five weeks they tested each

159
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,240
one of those tools in their environment

160
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,699
in our environment while I watched them

161
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,440
and I got to watch them interplay with

162
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,449
the tools I got to help them use the

163
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,460
tools they learned they taught me some

164
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:46,460
things about the tools I didn't know at

165
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,650
the same time I got to sit and watch

166
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,508
them through my environment how they

167
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:57,229
affected my environment where my

168
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:58,669
controls worked where they failed the

169
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:00,349
over the course of four weeks they

170
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:02,719
tested those tools they also took one

171
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:05,900
more week at the end to write a report

172
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,610
and give a presentation working on those

173
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,560
soft skills that a lot of the blue

174
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,659
collar information security people need

175
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,789
the most your ability to talk to other

176
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:16,250
people outside of your organization's is

177
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:17,340
almost as vital as your ability to log

178
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,290
into a firewall

179
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:25,169
put in a rule the the the way the work

180
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:28,139
would go was over the week I got them

181
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:29,940
for 18 hours a week six hours a day over

182
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,470
three days the first day I would

183
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,200
introduce a tool and the control I

184
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,539
wanted them to test the next day and a

185
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,190
half they would spend testing that

186
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,559
control and then the last day I would

187
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,150
teach a two-hour class on this is the

188
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,010
control we put in place to stop you from

189
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,680
doing what you did here's how successful

190
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,569
you were here's some ideas on why I did

191
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,560
what I did and what it means to our

192
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:55,860
organization how this is how I would

193
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,839
respond to it if in case this ever

194
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,670
happened in my environment and these are

195
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,360
the tools that I use to do my job from

196
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:06,870
day to day so how did it work

197
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,420
as far as I'm concerned this thing paid

198
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,250
for itself in the first week our interns

199
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,500
were able to find a control that we put

200
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,800
in place that had a typo in it that made

201
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,200
the control completely ineffective

202
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,699
completely ineffective fortunately that

203
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,339
control was only put in the week earlier

204
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,589
so there wasn't a lot of time but paid

205
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,540
for itself in a week the students got to

206
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:29,400
play with I know their attack tools and

207
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,630
they did some attacking but they got to

208
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,370
play with those tools in a live

209
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,900
environment and they got to see what

210
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,120
happens when you apply defensive

211
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,890
measures against those tools they got

212
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,709
exposure what it takes to defend a

213
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,770
network against the tools and they got

214
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:45,719
experienced drafting a report and giving

215
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,060
a presentation to an executive about

216
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,589
exactly what they found and the report

217
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,689
was awesome it's everything I could have

218
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,150
wanted from report it showed where we

219
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:57,990
were strong it showed where we were weak

220
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,670
it gave us a direction to go to to fill

221
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,550
some of the gaps and fix some of the

222
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,170
problems we had in our controls it's

223
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,949
everything you want from controls

224
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,620
testing or a Red Team report the

225
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:13,500
teachers we had two teachers they traded

226
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,779
back and forth the first was Terry

227
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,430
brought from the Center for Advanced

228
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,680
Learning which is a technical high

229
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,989
school here and then halfway through

230
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,189
Tobin came in and Tobin works at Mount

231
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,160
Hood Community College at they what's

232
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,110
the name of your program the cyber

233
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,370
security and networking program at Mount

234
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,990
Hood Community College and Tobin's

235
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,820
giving a talk at one

236
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,170
and the reason why I'm giving this talk

237
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,230
is because I love the way this guy talks

238
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,930
so I highly advise you guys come at one

239
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:43,589
listen to his talk the teachers got to

240
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,969
see what live defense looks like in an

241
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:46,620
environment they got to see the tools

242
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,540
that I use the processes and procedures

243
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,420
that I use they got to ask me direct

244
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,449
questions about their curriculum versus

245
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:57,060
what the real-world implications are and

246
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,920
the the benefit of this is that they get

247
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,219
to now tune their curriculum in such a

248
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,479
way that they can give students

249
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,120
real-world experience and real-world

250
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,709
goals to attain to so when they leave

251
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,630
Mount Hood Community College which is a

252
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,790
two-year technical vocational program

253
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,740
they're gonna walk out with the skills

254
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:19,399
needed to get that level one blue collar

255
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:19,399
information security job additionally

256
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:26,849
additionally the teachers got a program

257
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:29,100
got a program that they could deliver to

258
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,260
the state to allow them to get funding

259
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,760
to possibly apply this program to more

260
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,180
companies so more people can take

261
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,860
advantage of this particular thing as

262
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,540
for me the things that I got from this

263
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,610
was a I got a better understanding of my

264
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,069
environment than I had before which is

265
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,709
if you are a jaded information security

266
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,959
person that's actually gold because you

267
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:51,630
think your environment is one way and it

268
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,189
creeps over time and being able to resit

269
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,459
and figure out how it's changed over

270
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:58,589
time is absolute gold I got to learn

271
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:00,180
better the controls I put in place and

272
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:01,860
some of the weaknesses of they are some

273
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,229
of the controls I put in place worked

274
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,029
amazingly well but had one fatal flaw

275
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,680
that needs to be addressed that I didn't

276
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:10,649
know existed until this but this

277
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,810
particular point I got her I got a

278
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:14,520
report to deliver to my bosses that

279
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,219
showed that I was doing a good job but I

280
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,079
still had some work to do but most of

281
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,760
all and this is super cliche and I

282
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,529
really hate that I have to say this I

283
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,390
learned as much from the students as

284
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:27,630
they learned from me that's super cliche

285
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,220
that should have gone on a slide but we

286
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,260
work in a very negative environment

287
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,420
where it's easy to get jaded and cynical

288
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,610
and sometimes working with fresh faces

289
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,310
and fresh ideas and the energy that only

290
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,770
comes from the youth is just the Shawn

291
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:44,000
the army need to get get out of your own

292
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,000
way and move forward

293
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,040
how do you get how do you get some of

294
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,080
this action

295
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,469
this is actually pretty easy and I have

296
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,029
I highly recommend going to Tobin's talk

297
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,440
and then talking to him afterwards he's

298
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,850
going to have all the best information

299
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,800
on how to do this but I do have

300
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:08,510
obligatory content first of all get out

301
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,430
your list of never ending list of things

302
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,200
to do and find four or five of those

303
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,900
things that are measurable achievable

304
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,970
and short-term projects don't focus on

305
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,040
long-term goals don't focus on research

306
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,730
focus on things that are actionable and

307
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,740
measurable break the lists in to achieve

308
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,630
over projects and make sure the barriers

309
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,250
for achieving those projects are removed

310
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,920
if there are things that you put in

311
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,060
place to stop people from doing things

312
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,469
remove those barriers so they can

313
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,529
achieve them you have a compressed time

314
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,580
frame you want them to be successful

315
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:40,310
baking opportunities to impart knowledge

316
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,920
the you have a bunch of knowledge that

317
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,510
the educators don't have because you

318
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,180
have lots of experience in the field

319
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:48,709
doing real security work and you need to

320
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,020
bake in opportunities to impart that

321
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:54,229
knowledge on them and don't shirk on the

322
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:56,180
soft skills if learning how to talk to

323
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,910
people about what you do is just as

324
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,640
important as your ability to do it and

325
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:03,050
then at the end contact Tobin and Darren

326
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,400
marks Darren I don't have Darren's here

327
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,069
he's not here

328
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,959
Darren marks works at back firmly back

329
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:13,010
now in for all he was their point

330
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,540
contact at at getting all of this put

331
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:18,040
together he was the person who got us

332
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:21,410
our interns the program he and Tobin are

333
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:26,959
performing are putting together is what

334
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:28,810
we took advantage of and thanks now this

335
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,650
usually has a bunch of questions so I'm

336
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,130
prepared to take a lots and lots of

337
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,670
questions

338
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:40,810
anyone yes they were on my live Network

339
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:40,810
yes they were attacking real stuff yeah

340
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:47,630
we'd haven't worked that out yet

341
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,850
controls testing is one of those awesome

342
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,010
things that never not need not needs to

343
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,390
be done so I always have controls that

344
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,240
need to be tested they can't possibly

345
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,890
test all of them I put in place and they

346
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,950
need to be tested regularly so they can

347
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:03,620
always come back I have no issue about

348
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,500
bringing them in as frequently as they

349
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,380
can possibly be brought in it depends on

350
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,670
their school schedule and stuff the the

351
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,290
part we're dealing with is funding and

352
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,430
one of the things that Tobin and Darren

353
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,680
are putting together is trying to get

354
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:18,920
state funding so that we don't have to

355
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:30,729
pay the interns the interns get paid by

356
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:33,680
the state rather than by us a

357
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:39,220
medium-sized company that's not terribly

358
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,219
large yeah yes sir

359
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,989
where it's basically I'm a corporate

360
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,150
defender I defend my company from bad

361
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,590
guys I could take this program to any

362
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,780
sector I could take this anywhere

363
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,640
because there's always things that need

364
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,010
to be tested there's always small little

365
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,790
things that I need to get done that I

366
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,790
just don't have time to do

367
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,089
the cycling of controls has nothing to

368
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,770
do with the interns the cycling the

369
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,710
controls go in place as they're needed

370
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,870
or has the technology changes or as the

371
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,220
infrastructure changes there are

372
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,900
standard sets but there are things that

373
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:42,540
are hey this would be a good idea let's

374
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:44,750
try that yes sir they were told don't do

375
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,750
that

376
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,530
I was I was watching them and monitoring

377
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,900
the whole time that's the point of

378
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,430
purple teaming and the only control that

379
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:59,760
they could have done harm with was a

380
00:16:53,430 --> 00:17:05,970
responder in our environment and we we

381
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:07,710
didn't the if you put barriers in place

382
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,150
for them achieving their goal they're

383
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,410
not gonna learn as much you're not going

384
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,000
to give you the full amount of testing

385
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,560
that you're going to want if you give

386
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,319
them a fictionalised environment you're

387
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,240
going to get a fictionalised results so

388
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,280
yeah don't don't put them in a place

389
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,720
don't put them in an opportunity to fail

390
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,720
put them in an opportunity to succeed

391
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:41,960
mm-hmm yeah in in a small environment

392
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:44,240
where we have a few resources yeah I did

393
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,950
I'm not gonna lie it did take my ability

394
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:53,299
to do my day job but the the benefit is

395
00:17:48,950 --> 00:18:05,149
I am better today than I was before him

396
00:17:53,299 --> 00:18:06,529
and that's all we can be is better so

397
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:09,018
that's what the Center for Advanced

398
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:10,190
Learning does it's a technical part-time

399
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:11,720
Technical High School where you go to

400
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,740
your regular high school halftime and

401
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,330
then you go to this high school and

402
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,440
inside there they have technical tracks

403
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,309
tobin's probably gonna talk all about

404
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,080
that at one o'clock our interns were

405
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:26,990
high school graduates moving on to

406
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:29,918
college programs yes sir yeah they were

407
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,919
sitting right in front of me whole time

408
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,019
they don't get free run of the building

409
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,019
no yes sir

410
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,549
it's it's all about it's all about

411
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:03,620
keeping the the task small if you keep

412
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:05,330
the project small and you keep them

413
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,428
bunched together so they're all thumb

414
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,470
attica li lined together so you don't

415
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:11,059
have interns jumping from one idea to

416
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:16,100
another idea to another idea so I don't

417
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:18,740
have to do the reset and that you make

418
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,408
the the everything measurable in the

419
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,600
short-term your amount of work for pre

420
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:25,610
work is just getting him on boarded at

421
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,629
that point and then maybe setting up the

422
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,820
environment so that they'll be

423
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,169
successful that took me a little bit of

424
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,600
time I'm not gonna lie it did take me a

425
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:37,809
little bit of time the report I got out

426
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,809
of it was well worth my time yes

427
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:57,299
I had to present this to my my VP who

428
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:58,830
was in charge and I sold it with Mount

429
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:07,139
Hood Community College offered to

430
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:12,240
renamed their computer lab after us know

431
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:15,480
the thing that I brought in is you sell

432
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,490
it as a this is good for the community

433
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,990
you live in a community your your

434
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,280
business lives in the same community

435
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,140
you're going to be trying to pull

436
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,379
information security personnel

437
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:27,960
eventually from this pipeline learning

438
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,010
to fill the pipeline helping them fill

439
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:34,590
the pipeline so when they graduate

440
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:36,570
they're perfect for your job and getting

441
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,309
interns into your environment means that

442
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,080
you get to see the new crop of

443
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:41,129
information security personnel and

444
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,309
you're going to see how they work and

445
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:46,230
that gives you first dibs so that's how

446
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:51,139
I sold it and the lab thing wasn't bad

447
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,140
either my questions

448
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:15,480
that would make my job way easier yeah I

449
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:16,859
totally I boarded that the the as long

450
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,259
as they achieved the goal which was

451
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,460
testing the control so if they if they

452
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:21,720
use another tool instead of we're at

453
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,730
windows credential interns that I made

454
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,730
me cats fine great that test the control

455
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:39,899
yeah that was the purple teaming part of

456
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:42,658
it when I originally drafted it I I kind

457
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:46,408
of set it on a red team and just let him

458
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:49,320
go and then and then just let him do

459
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:52,049
their thing I found it was way more

460
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,960
beneficial for me and for the company to

461
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:57,299
actually sit with them and not

462
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,429
necessarily walk them through the steps

463
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:01,859
on how to use the tools let them do

464
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:03,899
their thing let them learn give them

465
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:06,899
give them tools that are not difficult

466
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:08,340
to master and then I get to watch them

467
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:09,809
on the defensive side and when they have

468
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,230
questions I'm there to answer them I'm

469
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:14,489
here to fix problems I'm there to at one

470
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,600
point in time they got away with

471
00:22:14,489 --> 00:22:18,659
something they weren't supposed to and I

472
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,189
was there to stop them so I think I

473
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,799
think sitting down with them and doing

474
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,309
the actual purple teaming is worth your

475
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,809
your personnel time because they get to

476
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:30,590
learn the environment way in ways that

477
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:30,590
they didn't know it before

478
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:49,900
I did not but I work for a security

479
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:51,670
organization so I'm cheating the the the

480
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,470
thing that why this was such a perfect

481
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:57,100
report because it did show that the

482
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,600
controls were working in most cases but

483
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,429
there were gaps that were unforeseen

484
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,560
which is why it was the perfect report

485
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:05,650
because it shows that I was doing my job

486
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,419
that I did good that are our defenses

487
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,730
for domain administrator actually pretty

488
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,680
good but I still have a little more ways

489
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,450
to go I have more projects to do I have

490
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,010
more things in the pipeline to go so

491
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,030
those are the exact kind of reports the

492
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,580
ones that show me that I'm doing

493
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,139
everything right I'm suspect it's like

494
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,580
it's like well my doctor says my blood

495
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:34,990
pressure is fine I'm like I don't think

496
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:36,699
you know how many fries I experience

497
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:40,030
because they're not jaded and set in

498
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,620
their ways their brains work in lateral

499
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:45,210
ways that mine don't anymore because

500
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,209
I've lost that elasticity so

501
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,760
yeah cuz I still think that that's

502
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,470
adversarial your your white team doesn't

503
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,700
know what's going on they have to detect

504
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:30,110
it right yeah so purple teaming the they

505
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,940
know exactly what's going on they know

506
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,080
what time servers were compromised they

507
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,640
know exactly what servers are

508
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,990
compromised they know how they were

509
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,760
compromised that means they can go

510
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,990
through all of the data to see if

511
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,840
there's anything there to build a new

512
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:46,730
control with yeah yes

513
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,320
business in fact I recommend taking a

514
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,210
blue person and sticking him on the red

515
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,428
team teaching them had a red team and

516
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:55,850
then while they're doing that also doing

517
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:58,120
their blue team activities I think who's

518
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:00,469
got the time cuz I think my time's up

519
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:04,280
no they're supposed to be someone who's

520
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:06,410
got my light nobody has the light all

521
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:10,250
right well 11:30 that's my time's up

522
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:19,550
everybody I got four minutes all right

523
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:21,140
any more questions we write the report

524
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,240
and as they were writing the report I

525
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,650
was editing the report saying hey you're

526
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,570
talking to these types of people you

527
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,770
need to include this information you're

528
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,240
talking to these types of people you

529
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,429
need to move this this type of

530
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,380
information because executives don't

531
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:35,840
need all the details and some people do

532
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,160
need all the details I help them write

533
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,840
the presentation to make sure they

534
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,160
delivered the right information to my

535
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,520
executive when they give their

536
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,990
presentation yeah that was I was

537
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,580
actually trying they and they did the

538
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,890
whole report the right out of the report

539
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,080
and the presentation in one week how

540
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,850
many red team organizations have you

541
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,090
ever dealt with has done a report in a

542
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,090
week

543
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:12,720
yeah probably if I had them that's great

544
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:16,029
I just didn't I just don't have him yet

545
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,559
yeah and and he accidentally breaks all

546
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:19,990
the things no using internal poisons is

547
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:22,320
great if they're interested in and the I

548
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,610
I really enjoyed using interns because

549
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,529
one thing I learned when I was in until

550
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,330
I went down to Costa Rica and went and

551
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:31,600
taught a class down in Costa Rica to the

552
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:34,750
sock down there and sock personnel if

553
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,928
you how many people are in a sock you

554
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:40,630
job sucks doesn't it it sucks it's it's

555
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,909
it's a very stressful job and it's it is

556
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,100
repetitive and not necessarily rewarding

557
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:48,220
and when I went down there and teach the

558
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,600
sock people some apt hunting stuff they

559
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,250
were so excited about it they were just

560
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,678
wanted to learn they just wanted to be

561
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,179
there and learn everything that they

562
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,029
could because their career depended on

563
00:26:55,179 --> 00:27:01,179
it to get him out of the sock and that's

564
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:02,620
what that's what the interns were like

565
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:04,440
they just wanted to learn they just

566
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:09,610
wanted to be there they just wanted to

567
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:16,440
play around and show me things that I

568
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:16,439
hadn't seen before so great sure

569
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:57,150
it's the ultimate blue-collar job yes

570
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,560
and no but you can also make them hungry

571
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,880
ones if you can learn how to talk to

572
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:11,909
them in the way that they want to

573
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:13,290
understand it yeah so one of the things

574
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:17,130
that one of the things is super

575
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:19,050
impressive was two weeks before they got

576
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,990
there a harm jury released it goes back

577
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:25,710
and goes pack doesn't come in a binary

578
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:27,030
format it's he only gives you the source

579
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,130
code and compile it and while the

580
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,690
interns took it home and compiled it and

581
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,500
brought it in because I didn't I didn't

582
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:36,600
do it I just and we tested it and it was

583
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,220
awesome but then because our tool

584
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,750
detected it I'm like well we should try

585
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,080
to obfuscate this so he taught himself

586
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:45,690
had to obfuscate what was it

587
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,460
c-sharp c-sharp code I brought it back

588
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:50,090
in and we tested the Optus kata versions

589
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,090
of it so yeah

590
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:01,540
way too early this is we just started

591
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,070
this program and they're just now

592
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,420
starting college

593
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,309
one of them's going to my alma mater

594
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:10,690
which I feel for him because it's in

595
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:13,330
Klamath Falls I said I'm sorry I'm

596
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,440
Austin we lost that guy forever alright

597
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,939
there's supposed to be something

598
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,010
speaking right now That's not me

599
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,490
I'm sorry I didn't mean to take your

600
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,490
time I tried

601
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,369
[Applause]

602
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,980
