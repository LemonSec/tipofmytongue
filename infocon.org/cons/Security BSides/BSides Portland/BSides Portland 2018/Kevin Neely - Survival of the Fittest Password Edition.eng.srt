1
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:24,250
thank you Scott so who likes changing

2
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:27,939
passwords okay there's a couple of you

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,470
this move maybe I'll have let's see what

4
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:30,610
kind of people we are who likes forcing

5
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,040
other people to change their passwords

6
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,350
there's a few more of you okay okay well

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,839
I hope I'm not trying to change your

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,220
mind about that just a little bit so a

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,160
little bit about me Scott gave a great

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,800
intro I have done a few things in my

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,679
life I started out sysadmin

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,140
I worked as an attorney practice law for

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,850
a couple years decided that wasn't for

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,480
me and it came back to tech and security

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:58,170
and now I run the security program at

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,550
Pierce storage down in the Bay Area so

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,839
you know I'm not gonna go I'm not going

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,640
to bore you with some really deep

19
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:05,199
technical details I'm probably a lot of

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,090
you have tried cracking passwords before

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,310
I am however going to give you all of

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,980
the kind of tools you need to do that

23
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,770
because my goal here is to set you up

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,870
with a methodology and some of the tools

25
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:20,259
that you need to implement what we've

26
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:22,690
done at pure storage at your own place

27
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:26,350
of work so I'm gonna review our approach

28
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,940
and and then I've got here the slot us

29
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,229
but the slides there may be slightly

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,630
different I made a couple of hits last

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,550
night but the slides and some some

32
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,839
scripts and some how to walkthroughs all

33
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,080
in the github and that will also be at

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,030
the end so why so you might have heard

35
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,789
that NIST released this guidance kind of

36
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,380
surprising many that something we all

37
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,910
kind of knew is that path changing

38
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,880
passwords on a regular basis is actually

39
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,590
bad practice so it results in people

40
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,949
either using basically the same password

41
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,870
every time by changing a character or or

42
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,160
writing it down if they have to do that

43
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,930
if it's long and they have to change it

44
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,360
a lot so it results in all this kind of

45
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,940
bad activity and then also I don't know

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,130
how many of you were this but I've been

47
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,068
a Blue team almost all my life so you

48
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,690
know we kind of are often in

49
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,339
firefighting mode we're responding to

50
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,750
things we're triaging events and whatnot

51
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,129
and we don't get to do some of the fun

52
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,180
cool things that everybody in the

53
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:17,829
conference's talked about cuz

54
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,780
conferences are mostly filled with red

55
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,570
teamers talking about what they do so

56
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,650
this allows the team to kind of get in

57
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,230
there and do this

58
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,239
kind of cool thing of cracking passwords

59
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,470
and seeing what they get and also you

60
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
get to learn some interesting thing

61
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,989
about your coworkers

62
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,620
so some people choose some very

63
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:38,230
interesting passwords and also it's

64
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,049
proven to be pretty effective so what

65
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,608
you see here is the number of passwords

66
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:44,019
we've we've been doing this for about

67
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:46,810
three years and you see here the number

68
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,310
of passwords we cracked as well as the

69
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,840
percentage of employees that was so you

70
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,670
see that in the first couple quarters

71
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,019
while people were still learning we were

72
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,260
cracking more but we were a fairly

73
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,310
rapidly growing company so

74
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,858
quarter-over-quarter we actually see a

75
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,840
steady decline and then a little bit

76
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:03,879
more precipitous decline of the

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,489
percentage of employees that we crack

78
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,470
and I don't have this data on this slide

79
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:13,090
but it is a little bit disproportionate

80
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,889
to new hires so and this is kind of why

81
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,200
so the common password policies that

82
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:19,720
we're all accustomed to basically say

83
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,220
that the first example here is not OK

84
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,500
while the second one is perfectly

85
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,870
acceptable for you to put in your kind

86
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,709
of put in your password to meet the

87
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,329
policy that they want right so so what

88
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,949
happens in reality and I think as most

89
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:34,510
of us probably know is that those are

90
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:36,660
just as easy to crack because these

91
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,250
substitutions are so common and so

92
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,069
regularly used by people that we just

93
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,109
check in and so you know kind of

94
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:45,608
information security twitter agrees so

95
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:47,079
there's a lot of people that talk about

96
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:48,669
this talked about the you know make fun

97
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,840
of the password policies that they see

98
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:51,909
when they're signing up for their bank

99
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,319
like why are you making me do this why

100
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:56,379
won't you let me do this but you let me

101
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:58,780
do this so this is fairly common so we

102
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:01,030
wanted to take this approach but where

103
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,250
the difficult part is is that we have

104
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,310
customers who put security requirements

105
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,959
upon us or or ask us to meet certain

106
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,359
security provisions they will say here's

107
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,769
our 80 page security policy before we

108
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:13,720
can buy from you you need to meet that

109
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,819
we're a business-to-business corporation

110
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,798
so they can do these kinds of things or

111
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,570
we've got auditors and you might be in a

112
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:21,010
regulated company you might have a shock

113
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,199
sarbanes-oxley that you've got to worry

114
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:26,050
about you might be working for stock to

115
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,729
certification ISO 27001 any of those and

116
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,229
you'll have auditors that come in and

117
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:31,830
they've been doing this for years and

118
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:33,300
they've got a checklist and this is you

119
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,530
one of those easy things for them to

120
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,360
check off right they're gonna just say

121
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,309
what's your password policy when they

122
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,540
say that they're what they really mean

123
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,850
is what are your settings in Active

124
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,030
Directory you have to do this fairly

125
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,040
long amount of time to train them that

126
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,650
is not a policy that your policy is

127
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,150
something that is in our case is you

128
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,590
must have a strong password and if it's

129
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,060
strong you get to keep it and if you

130
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,650
have a weak password we're gonna make

131
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,070
you change it and we test that every

132
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,969
quarter so you have to do this kind of

133
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,349
retraining of your auditors and

134
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,000
compliance personnel to let them know

135
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,620
that's what you mean and that those

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,230
settings in Active Directory are just a

137
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,990
mechanism to assist your users to do

138
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,790
that so so how do we do this so I'm not

139
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,380
gonna go super technical but I do want

140
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,080
to you know kind of give you an overview

141
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,150
of what we do and so the first thing you

142
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,840
need is you need some sort of equipment

143
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:24,060
right so you need either use of the

144
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,650
cloud services such as AWS or Azure or

145
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,380
build your own kind of password cracking

146
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,700
rig which is also kind of a fun activity

147
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,219
good good reason to spend a little bit

148
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,050
of money and and then you need to come

149
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,180
up with some words and something that's

150
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,490
really good for for coming up with

151
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,620
dictionaries and word lists is really

152
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,210
knowing your users so or knowing your

153
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,830
target if you're kind of red teaming but

154
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,979
in our case it's knowing our company and

155
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,620
so knowing our culture knowing you know

156
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,450
knowing the geographic locations and

157
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,730
knowing the language that they speak and

158
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,229
then knowing kind of this goes along

159
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,090
with culture the jar again the internal

160
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,310
jargon that we use and then you've got

161
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,500
to choose some kind of tool and so we've

162
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,260
actually landed on hash cap but hash can

163
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,330
John the Ripper are both really good

164
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,480
examples of tools that are both free to

165
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,680
use and get totally get the job done

166
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,800
we started with hash cat it's

167
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,390
historically a little bit more his

168
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,290
relied upon GPUs which gives you a

169
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:21,900
higher crack rate or hash rate but in

170
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,580
both cases those work I don't know how

171
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,870
long some of you've been around but back

172
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,180
in the day when we were all in the same

173
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,530
collision domain Cain and Abel was a

174
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,350
real fun one to run because they would

175
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:33,450
listen on the network pick the pick up

176
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,980
the the hashes that are flying the LM

177
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,420
hashes usually they're flying across the

178
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,000
network and just started cracking away

179
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,560
and then what we do is I mention we do

180
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,600
this a recorder and we take about seven

181
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,100
days to do it and and I'm actually

182
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,890
new information here we're in the middle

183
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,840
of this process right now we there's

184
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,940
four of us and so we each take turns at

185
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,989
a quarter and we started this past

186
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:58,530
Thursday and decided to use the newest

187
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,210
set of GPUs in Amazon and our we usually

188
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,770
took two days to do brute force and

189
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,599
that's just an easy way to check those

190
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,940
those low characters in case in the

191
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,740
administrators kind of behind the scenes

192
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,240
changed someone's password to a to a

193
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,250
seven character password or whatnot

194
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,260
which is below the minimum that we've

195
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,490
set in Active Directory that used to

196
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,630
take us two days and that was actually

197
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,250
kind of nice because what we would do is

198
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,880
take any research that's been released

199
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,770
over the past quarter any dumps that are

200
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,120
like listed on Krebs on security comm or

201
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,609
something like that take that take those

202
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,950
and incorporate them into our word lists

203
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,200
unfortunately he told me that it only

204
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,789
took them nine hours so he didn't get as

205
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,640
much of a time frame but now he can

206
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:37,200
spend more time on building rules to go

207
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,960
the word lists to do some mask

208
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,640
processing and then on the seventh day

209
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,840
we then all of the people that we've

210
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,219
cracked we then start sending out the

211
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,510
notifications give them two weeks and

212
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,790
then they have to change it everybody

213
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,960
else is cool so the brute force is

214
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,930
straightforward right that just means

215
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,909
crack it as you know try every single

216
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,190
combination for X number of characters

217
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,470
so that's that's super straightforward

218
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:01,170
and then we start doing the word lists

219
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,220
and that is basically some of the stuff

220
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,270
that I was talking about like if you

221
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,010
know your culture you know the

222
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,090
geographic region there are some tools

223
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:11,219
out there where you can where you can

224
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:14,099
essentially creates maybe geographically

225
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,200
specific words so you will go out there

226
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,480
and you specify the Bay Area for example

227
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,000
and it will pull things like warriors

228
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,500
and Stanford and street names and things

229
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,650
like that things that people tend to use

230
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,540
with their with their to make to

231
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,520
construct their passwords and another

232
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,440
really good source of information here

233
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,150
is if you just mind your internal wiki

234
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,010
or your internal knowledgebase whatever

235
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,490
you use to to support that because

236
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:40,140
that'll get in any kind of especially

237
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,860
any kind of code names that people we

238
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,750
use all original company names if you're

239
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,820
fairly young and you had a different

240
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,730
name when you're a stealth startup those

241
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,890
are interesting so then we move on to

242
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,510
kind of the rules and this is how you

243
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,280
take those word lists which which are

244
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,040
going to have

245
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,449
an okay but fairly low hit rate and

246
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,459
turned them into that example at the

247
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,470
beginning where you substitute the a for

248
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,060
an @ symbol the S is for dollar signs

249
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,940
are fives and things of that nature

250
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,040
and it's it's got a number of rules that

251
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,130
are that are built in or you can develop

252
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,260
your own that then apply to the word

253
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:19,010
list that you've fed into the tool and

254
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:22,189
then lastly one that I actually find a

255
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:25,160
lot of benefit from or a lot of really

256
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,980
high hit rate is using masks and masks

257
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,350
are basically a targeted brute force so

258
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:33,470
in the example I've got up here the this

259
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:36,410
is this is hash cat kind of language I

260
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,240
guess and so the you know you do a

261
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,280
question mark a and it means any

262
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,110
character and L is the lowercase ones

263
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,150
the use uppercase and once you learn

264
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,710
your your user behavior or just people

265
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,290
behavior in general you can just pull

266
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,700
down a word list just take a glance at

267
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,380
how people construct their passwords now

268
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,900
a very common format is to do uppercase

269
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,550
a bunch of lowercase and then tack on a

270
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,140
couple numbers to meet that that

271
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,609
password policy that they're they're

272
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,260
trying to meet right which they don't

273
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,240
really want to do so you do that and

274
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:06,410
you're now able to check a lot more of

275
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,360
likely key space whereas if you're

276
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:11,000
trying to brute-force 10 characters it's

277
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,100
gonna take you a few years you take just

278
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,960
check the 10 characters for upper those

279
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,120
lowers a couple digits and it takes you

280
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,480
like 30 minutes so that allows you to

281
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,040
really get done and so in here I've put

282
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,500
a couple of examples of exactly the kind

283
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,390
of the the command line that you would

284
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,110
use but that's boring to look at right

285
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,130
so I thought I'd show a couple so I'm

286
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:36,020
gonna have to don't have this on my

287
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:40,339
screen so what we've got here is is

288
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:42,589
straight up just hash cat running with

289
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:45,020
the parameters mean a three the attack

290
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:47,030
mode is a brute-force mode it's a it's

291
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,339
an NT database or extracted from an NT

292
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,319
Active Directory database it's got the

293
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:53,089
user names in there I'm specifying where

294
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,460
the where the results go and then I'm

295
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:57,080
just trying everything and I think

296
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:00,530
that's actually 9 characters and it

297
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,730
doesn't look like I've got any but we'll

298
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,900
check the status and I'm just running

299
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,220
this on a Mac Book here this is not what

300
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,290
we do but you'll see that it's gonna

301
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,360
take a really long time right so let's

302
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:13,189
maybe kill that one

303
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,810
and check one where I'm talking about

304
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,950
where I've gone a little bit more

305
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,018
specific

306
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,640
with my mask and you'll see I start to

307
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:21,260
get hits immediately even though it's on

308
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,209
a pretty low powered system and what

309
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,769
I've done is I've just done uppercase or

310
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:26,479
any character and then some lowercase

311
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:28,250
and then a bunch of any any any this is

312
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,110
actually our database from back in 2015

313
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,440
so all these have been changed but

314
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:36,110
they're they're pretty common and then

315
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,670
and again so let's see didn't say yes so

316
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,870
that was going to take 115 days and like

317
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,740
I said it's gonna take like 20 minutes

318
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:43,670
on the stuff that we run but then we can

319
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,510
do something a little bit more

320
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,310
interesting such as using a specific

321
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,620
word list that I've downloaded there's a

322
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,420
place on github that's got probable word

323
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,950
list so it's kind of a constructed

324
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:59,660
likely set of passwords I think this

325
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:01,370
one's a few hundred thousand and we're

326
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,140
doing that and then we're also doing

327
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,089
what's called a hybrid mask attack so

328
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,250
we're taking those words and then at the

329
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:08,510
end of it we're tacking on any four

330
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,370
character so we're gonna brute force

331
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,410
just the four characters tacked on to

332
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,180
the word so if password was in the

333
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:19,279
probable word list then we would try

334
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:22,609
password 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 ABCD and so

335
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,740
on and so forth so we run that and we'll

336
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,980
see that we very quickly get a lot of

337
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,570
passwords even even on a MacBook Air so

338
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:34,100
so you you run through them very quickly

339
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:39,649
and it works pretty well in questions

340
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:41,390
about those ok I'm gonna move on so now

341
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:43,640
now that you've kind of seen how we do

342
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,959
this and again I just want to say that

343
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,360
you know that just kind of giving you

344
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,339
the the surface of the actual technical

345
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,880
piece of this and that all of its very

346
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:54,860
fairly well documented on github with

347
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,779
the ability to extract the data from

348
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,220
Active Directory which which is easy but

349
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:59,480
it takes a while then you forget how you

350
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,370
do it every quarter and you have to do

351
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,890
it again so eventually we documented it

352
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,390
and then what we also do kind of for the

353
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,189
auditors although I've never been asked

354
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,899
for this but for the honors we actually

355
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,279
store all of that in our internal github

356
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,670
and a private repository just for my

357
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,380
team

358
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,959
so we'll we'll upload the original

359
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,339
hashes the results all of the rules that

360
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,959
we use all the masks that we chose to

361
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:19,880
use that quarter so then it's all a

362
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:21,199
fairly reproducible and we can we can

363
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,850
very clearly explain

364
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,140
to the otters now they have asked they

365
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,700
said do you document and do you have

366
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,140
this evidence and I say yes would you

367
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,000
like to see it I've never been taken up

368
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,060
on that offer I think I think that's

369
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,260
that's where they stop so what we found

370
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,270
you know I've just got some kind of

371
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,770
interesting results and and stuff that

372
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,260
we found over the course of doing this

373
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,660
for three years and this is a little bit

374
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,400
not exactly how we do it cuz I told you

375
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,770
that we brute force upfront but if I

376
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,170
were to rearrange the ways that I I do

377
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,449
the testing and just like I did with the

378
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,490
testing that last one was much more

379
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,320
efficacious than the first one right so

380
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,760
if I put them in that order what we find

381
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,290
is that really in the first four to

382
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,360
eight hours we're gonna get the bulk of

383
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:02,630
the passwords were going to get and then

384
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,860
it's it's a real low tale afterwards but

385
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,870
because we kind of do it that way to

386
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,370
give us some time to set up this this is

387
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,900
not what our graph looks like unless we

388
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,700
choose to do it that way but that's what

389
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,240
you can find so if you're really either

390
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,800
crunched for time or crunched for money

391
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,530
because renting this Eneida as or as

392
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,270
yours pretty expensive then you can

393
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,970
rearrange them like that and and just

394
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,710
and just kind of maybe trust that

395
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,210
everybody's meeting that a character or

396
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,200
nine character or ten character minimum

397
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,780
that you've set in your password

398
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,260
settings and then the composition can be

399
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:35,660
interesting so unsurprisingly we see the

400
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,770
bulk of nine because that's the bare

401
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,600
minimum that people are allowed to have

402
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:41,180
we did we have caught some with the

403
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,950
sevens and the eights like I said but

404
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,229
then we also catch a fair number in the

405
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,330
in the 12s and the 14s and the 16s and

406
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,830
even higher I think the thing that was

407
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,080
most interesting to me is that the most

408
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,940
that the majority of people that we

409
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,170
found of course this is all just what we

410
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,540
found out the people that we don't find

411
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,829
is that they actually were using all

412
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,839
four characters I was really expecting

413
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,220
the bulk of people did he use more of a

414
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,280
minimum and just use three characters

415
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,840
and so then we also found you know

416
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,520
you've aggregated it and you see what's

417
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,690
common over time and some of these could

418
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,490
be service accounts but what's most

419
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,470
interesting for us at a company called

420
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,560
pure storage is that pure is the base

421
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:19,070
word and four of the top ten passwords

422
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,900
and this link should be in there so you

423
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,750
can do some of this analysis once you've

424
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:26,240
got the the raw lists of passwords that

425
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,370
you've cracked there's a couple projects

426
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,750
I think the one I use is called PI pal

427
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,060
so pipl

428
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,740
it's in github and the link should be in

429
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,030
the notes

430
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,220
you'll just run through it and make

431
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,079
these kind of cool ascii graphs but also

432
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,820
give you some just summarize the data

433
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,410
and tell you where you are so that's

434
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,210
that's how I've done these then I turn

435
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,060
them into Google sheets and to make a

436
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,220
pretty graph so you know we were doing

437
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,290
it for a couple years and what we found

438
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,270
is that you know just by kind of

439
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,949
eyeballing the results and what now we

440
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,360
started to notice certain ones that

441
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,220
would come over and over again as one

442
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,060
person in particular he had Starcraft 1

443
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,790
then Starcraft 2 and Starcraft 1 - and

444
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,510
so we decided to take I mean seriously

445
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:10,069
it's it but so what we decided to do is

446
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,410
we started to give them a separate set

447
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:15,290
of notifications right so we wrote

448
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,790
there's a just took a Python module that

449
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,880
takes simulator you have one string to

450
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,680
another we decided on 70% so if if if

451
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,230
you were caught both times in a row and

452
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,060
you're a current one is 70% similar to

453
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,670
your previous one what we do is you get

454
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,760
a special email that says hey we noticed

455
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,680
that your password this time is X

456
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,860
percent similar it's just a mail merge

457
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,959
of your last week last month's password

458
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,180
or less quarters password of this and we

459
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,710
put that in the email and I think most

460
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,000
people or many of the people don't even

461
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,200
realize that's not the current one it's

462
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,610
the previous one because it looks almost

463
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,950
the same and so we'll get some

464
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,440
interesting reactions there people will

465
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,210
say how can you send me my password in

466
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,060
email it's totally unsecured and I'll

467
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,170
say well like I mean there's some

468
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,140
interesting research out there that

469
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:03,229
shows that given given knowledge of your

470
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:05,900
current password they have a 20 percent

471
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,040
chance of guessing your net 20 percent

472
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,840
chance of guessing your next password

473
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,790
within five tries and so what's

474
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,829
interesting about that is that probably

475
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,659
gets under the radar of any of our

476
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,460
password lockout policies because I

477
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,930
think ours the six no ours is five but

478
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,780
that would be get within five you're

479
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,520
gonna miss it right so that's a fairly

480
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,050
scary bit of research given that

481
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,670
knowledge and given how many passwords

482
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,450
are out there so this is just kind of an

483
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:31,930
example of one of those repeat offender

484
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:35,420
tries we're in August of 2017 we found

485
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,620
805 people followed by only 490 the

486
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:42,830
following quarter which is pretty great

487
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:44,959
but of those 493 and 334 were of the

488
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,350
same what we're failing both times and

489
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,880
of

490
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:52,399
thirty-eight failed bow times and they

491
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,980
got this special email so kind of

492
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:57,768
wrapping up just just some lessons

493
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,970
learned so I I'm in the piece on get lab

494
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:02,659
and I think that's really important

495
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,580
because our hardest challenge our

496
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:06,019
biggest roadblock was the compliance and

497
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,059
honors piece it was not the technical

498
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:09,919
aspect it was not convincing people we

499
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:11,210
got a lot of complaints like we still

500
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,950
get people that think that we store

501
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,630
their passwords in plain text and then

502
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,730
we've got to explain to them no they're

503
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,460
all fully hash to the one-way hash but

504
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:22,370
it's so easy to guess that we got yours

505
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,409
so so we the get Habs interesting the

506
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,239
github or get lab is interesting that

507
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:29,480
was a combination of git live lab and

508
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,460
github the the fact that we rotate it

509
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,049
through the team is pretty great it

510
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,809
gives a lot of people interesting things

511
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:37,070
to do when their day job is maybe for

512
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:38,960
the rest of the years kind of triaging

513
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,320
alerts from the Sam or something like

514
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,090
that

515
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,730
and so the other thing that's been

516
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,949
interesting is that because this doesn't

517
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,720
follow the standard change procedure at

518
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,919
most companies where everybody's

519
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,080
changing their password every 90 days

520
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,190
but it's completely dispersed across the

521
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,769
company right not everybody's doing it

522
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,419
at once our helpdesk continues to get

523
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:58,100
really nervous about this even though at

524
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:01,190
this point we're only sending about 230

525
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,049
or 350 notifications and they get really

526
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,159
nervous like they act like it's the the

527
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,379
first time we've done it every time

528
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,120
we've done it for three years but the

529
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,379
reality is that most people are gonna

530
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,279
even though they've got the two weeks

531
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:10,908
they're gonna wait to the last couple

532
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:12,649
days to do it

533
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:13,940
most of them are gonna do it and a few

534
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:16,639
people are gonna be locked out but it's

535
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,990
not really gonna be any more than lock

536
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:19,158
themselves out during the course of

537
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,159
business women' we're not forcing the

538
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:25,100
change passwords so that's pretty much

539
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:27,940
it I'm open for questions if you guys

540
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,939
got questions okay

541
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,730
I guess I'm not familiar so so it

542
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:47,679
actually gives you a password kinda like

543
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:49,840
a password manager it gives you I am not

544
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,520
so so the big thing here is and it's

545
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,260
what we try to teach people we've we've

546
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,610
got a companion document that helps them

547
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,520
craft strong passwords because people

548
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,439
say people are so accustomed to putting

549
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,600
in meeting those criteria and it being

550
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,130
called a strong password and so we've

551
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,480
put this thing and that really tries to

552
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,220
drive home and this is a hard concept

553
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,659
for people to understand but tries to

554
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,480
drive home the entropy is the important

555
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:13,419
part and so it really depends upon the

556
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,780
Safari settings and whether or not it

557
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:19,059
generates high entropic work strings for

558
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,918
your password because if so it's very

559
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:22,809
hard for us because remember one things

560
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,610
that we do is we actually we actually

561
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:26,320
test for lower entropy by using those

562
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,610
masks right instead of testing

563
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,559
everything through the key space which

564
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,780
is computationally too expensive

565
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:33,399
well test for those those patterns that

566
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,918
we see people using time and time again

567
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,460
so if the settings are good is probably

568
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,460
a good tool

569
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:56,549
right so luckily I'm not I don't have to

570
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:59,160
answer the DoD so I it is certainly

571
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:01,020
helpful that I came into a company that

572
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,789
was a start-up that had absolutely no

573
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,650
password policy when I came into it and

574
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:06,270
that this is the direction we went and I

575
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:11,910
didn't have to steer a ship into a

576
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:13,650
different direction so still the

577
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,179
conversations with the auditors and

578
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:18,480
again customers because they give us a

579
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:20,130
little bit of a hard time too it's you

580
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,330
just end up showing them the results

581
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,789
it's kind of what we've done so I think

582
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,860
I was lucky because I came into you like

583
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:28,500
a new company that was kind of fresh and

584
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:30,360
so I got to do it from off the bat but I

585
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,730
think you would have to do is do this

586
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:36,330
alongside your regular change regime and

587
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:38,429
then and then show the data and

588
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,470
hopefully it works because what I'm able

589
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:42,570
to show now is that we we were getting

590
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,220
not only kind of better security but

591
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,610
better security awareness because of the

592
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,190
downward trend of the people's choosing

593
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:52,979
weaker passwords if they straight up say

594
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:55,470
cracking is is verboten or something

595
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,850
along those lines perhaps you can come

596
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,130
up with a way where you can really

597
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,629
isolate that I mean we we do use it in a

598
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:04,559
double yes but there's no reason that

599
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:06,929
you couldn't extract the full like NTDs

600
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,280
did out of Active Directory put that on

601
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:09,659
on something and put it on an isolated

602
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,250
system that doesn't connect to the

603
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:12,600
internet right none of this is really

604
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,370
once you have the software really

605
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,439
requires being connected the internet so

606
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:19,320
I think that that might be might yeah

607
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,770
might be a way to hopefully address

608
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,770
those concerns

609
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,680
into their master so it so we've kind of

610
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,410
thought about that and we've thought

611
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,610
about a couple ways so it's in it we

612
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,740
don't have a plan for it but I think

613
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,629
it's it's interesting we do encourage it

614
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,640
right we do encourage the use of it

615
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,410
unfortunately there's no say group Paula

616
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,150
tyno of group policy or Jam for

617
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,500
configuration where I can choose their

618
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,520
settings for them like as we were

619
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,840
talking about the Safari ones because

620
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,570
that would be really cool like if I

621
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,669
could just set the settings that that

622
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,129
chooses their random password would be

623
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,420
great well what we are looking at though

624
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,160
is we've done it in the cloud because

625
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,020
that's been easier we haven't haven't

626
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,530
had since we only do it for a week it's

627
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:19,960
been about cost effective for us also it

628
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:22,149
gets completely buried in the ad aw

629
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,390
spend from like the service right so

630
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,650
nobody notices but you know we've been

631
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,450
looking for a reason to build something

632
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,190
on our own and all I'm looking for is

633
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,780
the reason to be running it kind of all

634
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,070
the time and if we were grabbing that

635
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,889
because I was also thinking about just

636
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:39,040
the the key chain manager and Mac we're

637
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,390
about 85 percent Mac so that might be

638
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,129
interesting as well because it's also it

639
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,450
stores those passwords so I haven't

640
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,740
thought about yet but it's it's kind of

641
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,950
on the horizon I think that'd be a good

642
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,950
approach

643
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:06,120
yet su mo okay yeah so most of the

644
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,500
methods that I talked about cuz cuz

645
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,639
because at the point where you're

646
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,740
talking out I get to hand it off to this

647
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,570
assignments no this stuff that I talked

648
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,460
about is mostly manual and we've written

649
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,470
it there's some of the analysis once

650
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,870
we've got the data we've script script

651
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,690
if I'd and then I mentioned that the we

652
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,590
mail merge out the the kind of repeat

653
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,390
offenders

654
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,040
the sis admins have done a great job of

655
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:29,040
basically writing that in PowerShell and

656
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,740
so they they do it they said oh no - at

657
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,760
least we send out the notifications

658
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,800
that's that's actually just a cron job

659
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:39,600
on a Linux server and it's it's really

660
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:41,159
ugly but it just uses mail X and in the

661
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,899
reason for doing that it was I did all

662
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,340
this date math and bash because I kept

663
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,500
getting the dates wrong I'm not good at

664
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,790
dates so I'll just do it in bash but

665
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,620
they they've done all that and so they

666
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,720
just they just at the at the end of the

667
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,070
time they just clicked the the you must

668
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,780
change password at next log and flag

669
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,399
using PowerShell and they just kind of

670
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:00,110
do it so it's pretty low touch for them

671
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,110
so it's pretty good and then

672
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,500
yet so what we do is we we do this on a

673
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,990
90 day basis and we force people to

674
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:23,490
change their password if it's week so so

675
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:24,960
we haven't correct which is always a

676
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,060
moving target so that's why in the

677
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,740
policy we define it as strong and strong

678
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:35,730
means we can't crack it and wheat means

679
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:37,260
we can and I think you could totally do

680
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,900
that you could totally put the age of

681
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,879
one year and then do this on a quarterly

682
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,470
basis making others change it at 90 days

683
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,790
and I think that would be fair and we've

684
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,890
talked about it at the time we were

685
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,030
fairly young and nobody had long you

686
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,290
know now we've got people that might not

687
00:25:48,030 --> 00:26:00,870
have changed it for five years so maybe

688
00:25:49,290 --> 00:26:06,720
we should start thinking about that it

689
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:08,340
won't be no I think I mean it's it's

690
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,010
just it's just hard to swallow right so

691
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:14,699
we have a fairly heavily engineering

692
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:16,830
culture and so I mean 16 might not work

693
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,180
but 10 might work because because I'll

694
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,949
get a lot of arguments about when I

695
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,110
talked about entropy with with you

696
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,240
I'll get arguments about like a high

697
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:26,129
highly entropic 10 character password

698
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,530
would be still very difficult for you to

699
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,720
the code and I'm sorry I'm I'm out of

700
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,350
time but I'll go outside and be happy to

701
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,510
talk to anyone

702
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:35,570
thank you

703
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,570
you

704
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,110
you
