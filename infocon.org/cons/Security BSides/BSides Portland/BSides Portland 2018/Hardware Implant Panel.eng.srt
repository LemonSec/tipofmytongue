1
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,370
[Joe F.:] We've got this Bloomberg article that just dropped. So if you haven't

2
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,739
read it, there is this article about "the big hack". And both Joe and I are quoted

3
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,140
in that article and our quotes are used to talk about the possibility

4
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,120
that there's this itty-bitty tiny chip that the Chinese government has implanted on

5
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,780
a bunch of super micro motherboards and it has infiltrated 30 companies in the

6
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:59,290
United States. Which is all a very
interesting and entertaining story, but

7
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,599
many of us are hardware people or technical people who get

8
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,100
really excited about the capability and what's possible. And I myself am very

9
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,190
excited when I hear descriptions of these things like, wow, we could do

10
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,340
this, we could do this, we could do this, we could do this and now we have a proof

11
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:22,090
of concept and very frequently encounter people who take the words that I say

12
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,750
about a proof of concept and think that this is the next attack and

13
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,600
it's actually happening. Sometimes there are more conspiracy

14
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,408
theorists than others, but this is just a really interesting thing because it

15
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:37,570
ended up in a mainstream media news article that had some pretty significant

16
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,610
impacts on the industry. So Joe and I decided that the best way we could

17
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,170
respond to this is to turn this keynote slot into a panel. We have a couple

18
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,610
people from Portland and beyond that are knowledgeable about the stuff that

19
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,689
happens. So we kind of lured all together. And then we thought well we need someone

20
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:58,508
to moderate the panel and we both thought that there really is no one

21
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,850
better than Kim Zetter to come and moderate the panel if we could just

22
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:07,770
convince her to get up here to do it. So thank you very very much Kim Zetter
[ Applause ]

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,159
I've had the privilege of getting to know her meeting several times at

24
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,019
conferences all over the place. We've talked several times. She has been

25
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:28,430
working on technical journalism for 15 years? Quite a while. And election

26
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,450
security for over ten years. She had an excellent- was it the New York

27
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,738
Times magazine cover story? or was it- Yeah, so on election security earlier

28
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:42,530
this month. And she's kind of a person we thought would be best to do this and she

29
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,609
said yes, so she's here. 
[Joe G.:] I think it's it's safe to say too that Kim is one of the

30
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:53,180
few journalists that we actually trust
[ Audience Laughter ]
and that's saying a lot given, as you'll see,

31
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,319
when we talk about this article. She's
been around and you know, yeah, thank you for coming.

32
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,160
[Kim:] Joe just has to say that because he spent last week bashing all journalists.

33
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:10,579
[ Audience Laughter ] 
And I got pissed off at him about it, so. 
[Joe F.:] So without further ado- I was gonna say one more thing I can't

34
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:14,060
remember what it was, but maybe I'll just interrupt- Oh, lightning bolts are still

35
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:22,129
here. So, Kim here you go. 
[Kim:] Did you want to introduce the panel? 
[Joe:] Okay, shall we start with Jason and

36
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:24,768
come back this way and just tell us about yourself and what your experience

37
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:30,229
with Hardware implants and hardware might be. 
[Kim:] Yeah, so the format here is we're

38
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:33,290
just going to go down the panel. I have them introduce themselves describe a

39
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,168
little bit about the hardware hacking they do and then we'll jump into the

40
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:40,879
article. And we don't want to spend a lot of time bashing the article, just

41
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,120
examining sort of what are the fallacies and what are the possibilities and then

42
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,780
broaden that to all of the hardware hacking.

43
00:03:50,780 --> 00:04:02,620
[Jason:] Hi, my name is Jason Meltzer I

44
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,120
guess this is always the biggest
existential question when you get shoved

45
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,340
in front of a group of people
"How am I going to describe myself today?"

46
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,918
So, for the last two years I've been
working with NCC groups hardware and

47
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:24,219
embedded security practice. We look at a lot

48
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:30,360
of, whether it's from
mobile devices to server hardware, for

49
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,840
a lot of companies, a lot of
embedded security stuff that goes

50
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,770
into even servers. One project that I can
talk about that we just recently

51
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,810
actually published a public report on
was the encrypted backup feature

52
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,730
that's in Android P. There's a feature that

53
00:04:52,730 --> 00:05:00,180
that allows Google to have the backup encryption keys

54
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,919
tied to your lock screen lock knowledge factor that Google

55
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,000
never has access to any of this data. They brought us in and we looked at

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,710
all of all of the hardware that underpins this. This includes the

57
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,409
what Google calls publicly as the Titan chip. So this is the kind of

58
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,800
stuff that I've been in for the last few years. Previous to that I was a security

59
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,720
researcher at Intel doing CPU core or internal security stuff, microcode stuff

60
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,300
and then before that lots of other system security stuff. But that's sort of

61
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,720
where I come from.

62
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:48,960
[Mike L.:] Hi, I'm r00tkillah, or Mike, and I started in embedded hardware and software and

63
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,669
built little embedded things and then I drifted around in development and into

64
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:57,719
software security et cetera. I kept running into people who would

65
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,850
say that hardware adversaries are out of scope like when they hook

66
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:08,250
up hardware it's game over and that kind of pissed me off. For lulz I just

67
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,240
make hardware implants to show that we're thinking about the hardware

68
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:21,390
security threat model wrong. I work on the Intel Red Team and we

69
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:29,940
do adversary modeling and it's fun. 
[Mickey:] My name is Mickey. I work for a small

70
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,729
company that does hardware and firmware security called Eclipsium. I

71
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:42,719
had a lot of experience looking at motherboards and working with Mike.

72
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:51,360
Recently I've looked at a lot of super
micro boards and it's a very, very fun topic.

73
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,780
[Kim:] Found anything interesting on any of
those?

74
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,599
[Mickey:] Maybe I'll tell you about it later.

75
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,809
[Mike G.:] I'm Mike Grover, _mg_ on Twitter.

76
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:06,669
Recently I've been playing around with usb-based

77
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:12,818
implants, like implants that go inside these cables. Kind of a focus on doing it

78
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:17,289
with really common and really cheap implant hardware, just a fun constraint.

79
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:27,780
[Joe F.:] I'm Joe FitzPatrick- 
[Kim:] Hold on a second, can you expand on that a little bit more?

80
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,169
[Mike G.:] Yeah, totally. Yeah, so I made the implant in this cable, for

81
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:36,639
instance. The demo has been HID attacks
were it pretends to be a keyboard and types

82
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,289
really fast on your computer. So, yeah,
you'll plug in this to your laptop, it'll

83
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:45,310
charge your phone and it'll also type on
your computer for you. I've got a few

84
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,849
other ones that are USB based. Whether, you
know, kind of emulating networked things like that, so

85
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:55,748
[Joe G.:] What about your exploding one? 
[Mike G.:] And an exploding one too just for fun. Yeah, if you could find a

86
00:07:55,749 --> 00:08:02,979
thumb drive that explodes I may have created that. 
[Joe F.:] So I'm Joe FitzPatrick. I

87
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:07,719
did hardware security previously at Intel, but in the past several years I've

88
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:12,430
worked a lot reproducing things from the ANT catalog which I found to be really

89
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,169
fascinating. All these Hardware implants
and what was the big learning key

90
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:21,938
element from the ANT catalog was that
these Hardware implants are used to give

91
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:24,819
software access and then it becomes a
software problem

92
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:28,089
my experience at hardware is like oh I'm
a hardware person I have Hardware

93
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:30,370
background I can do everything in
hardware but no we do stuff in software

94
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,948
I've built JTAG implants, I've built PCI
Express implants, I have applied these

95
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:42,399
implants to industrial control systems,
to embedded devices to PCs, all as demos

96
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,740
and proofs of concept. I've never seen a
real implant aside from like

97
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:53,020
counterfeit bypass devices. No one's ever
shown me one. So, Joe, have you ever seen one?

98
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,510
[Joe G.:] I have also never seen one but I've
seen a lot of your examples and the ANT

99
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,510
catalog is actually interesting because
what you guys have done with the NSA

100
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,170
Playset is sort of like using
off-the-shelf consumer stuff you haven't

101
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:11,020
had to create you know ridiculously tiny
complex systems. My name is Joe Grand, I

102
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:16,090
have, I make- I feel really old.
I've been hacking on things since 1982

103
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,900
I'm a professional electrical engineer
so I have production manufacturing

104
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,290
experience, but I've been in the hacker
world for that whole time since I was a

105
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:29,140
little kid. I just love designing
things I love breaking things and just

106
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,670
sort of a I don't know always kind of a
curmudgeon and kind of skeptic when it

107
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:39,310
comes to a lot of things. For this particular article Joe and I

108
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,160
are both quoted but I do I should
mention since I'm wearing a hat, which

109
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,480
most people never see me in a hat.
I had quoted about this implant as being

110
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,860
so- actually wasn't even about this
implant the quote was this general quote

111
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,450
about how hard it is to actually find if
there even is one that exists a real

112
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,180
good state-sponsored hardware implant
that's a secret,

113
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,000
you know secret thing that's actually
physically done on the board if it's

114
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,190
that good then it would be like seeing a
unicorn jump over a rainbow hence my hat,

115
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,820
if you can see it in the back. I had this
made at the county fair a few years ago

116
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,570
before I gave the quote. It's not
exactly the unicorn jumping over the

117
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:19,030
rainbow but it's as good as the guy
could do. So I figured I'd wear it today. But yeah, so hardware

118
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,709
hacker and engineer.

119
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:34,829
[Kim:] So, the Bloomberg article. So the
Bloomberg article is actually very lengthy, if

120
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:39,180
all of you have read it, but there's only
one line in it that actually describes

121
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,120
in any kind of technical term of what's
happening here. There are actually

122
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,050
two articles. There was a first
article that talks about the hardware

123
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,219
implant on the board and then the second
article that came out like the day after

124
00:10:50,220 --> 00:11:01,259
a week after. Here's the one
technical line in the article sorry okay

125
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:04,769
so officials familiar with the
investigation say the primary role of

126
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:11,324
implant such as these is to open doors
that other attackers can go through. 
"Hardware attacks are about access"

127
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:17,790
one former official puts it. "In simplified terms, the implants on Supermicro hardware manipulated

128
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:24,719
the core operating instructions that tell
the server what to do as data moves

129
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,769
across the motherboard", two people familiar with the chips say. This happened at a

130
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:32,579
crucial moment as small bits of the
operating system were being stored in

131
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:37,109
the board's temporary memory enroute
to the server's central processor, the CPU.

132
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,279
the implant was placed on the board in a
way that allowed it to effectively edit

133
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,629
this information cue injecting its own
code or altering the order of the

134
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:50,160
instructions the CPU was meant to follow.
Deviously small changes could create

135
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:57,180
disastrous effects. So, I just I want to
throw it out to the panel you know the

136
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:04,469
the the article has received a lot of
ridicule. But you've all sort of said

137
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:10,860
in one way or another that the
capabilities are not implausible.

138
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,730
I want you to reconcile those two issues, that the article itself

139
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:23,269
is implausible but the capabilities are plausible.

140
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:30,130
[Joe F.:] That is an interesting technical
description, because any of us who are

141
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,430
familiar with like the inner workings of
things those aren't words that we use to

142
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,430
describe how it works. Those are words
that a journalist would use to describe

143
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,959
something to a mainstream audience. So we can't interpret that sentence literally.

144
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,510
We have to interpret it through a filter
designed for a mainstream audience. That

145
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,590
said, what its describing is modifying
instructions, changing the sequence of

146
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,920
instructions. It reminds me a little bit of the wording in the Wassenaar arrangement

147
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,983
about the expected path of execution.

148
00:12:56,983 --> 00:13:04,750
Basically what I hear is this is how exploitation happens, right? We do something

149
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,430
external to modify how things execute. It's hard to extract any technical

150
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,880
detail about what's going on. When we get
over to the more low level hardware

151
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,120
side where we talk about hooking things
into the system and wiring them up and

152
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,720
the overall capabilities. Like can we
have something that goes and modifies

153
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,750
memory in a system? Yes, we have technical ways to do that. We can use PCI Express

154
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,280
DMA attacks. We can use debuggers to do that. When we talk about interrupting the CPU,

155
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,459
do we have it? Yes, built into every CPU
is debug features that let you halt

156
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,000
execution and change what it does. And
these are things that are documented or

157
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,720
not documented and if you're a state
spectrum actor you have access to that

158
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,050
documentation. None of the technical
details are implausible, but what really

159
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:51,310
gets me is the combination of all of
them in a strange way. Anyone else want to add to that?

160
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,810
[Joe G.:] I guess a little bit of backstory too, so this article came out less than a month

161
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,650
ago, a few weeks ago. Joe and I
had both been contacted by the

162
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,550
journalists nearly two years ago. So this
article is not something that just came

163
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,120
out like you know this new investigation
they've been working on it for a long

164
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,100
time. What we came to realize is the
journalists were independently

165
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:30,160
contacting us basically asking sort of
these somewhat technical sentences that

166
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,610
didn't exactly make sense like, "What
could you do with something the size of

167
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,150
a grain of rice on a motherboard?" or this,
or that. Very vague sort of

168
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:41,890
things and neither of us ever actually
knew the whole story of what was going

169
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,160
on, but we didn't realize this until
after the fact. That they were bouncing

170
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,600
our responses off of each other to find
something that seemed to make sense. So I

171
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,690
think the article, and I haven't talked
to the reporter since and I won't,

172
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:00,130
because I spent enough time trying to
educate them in the first place, but it

173
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:05,200
just, it seems like he had maybe been fed
something and then started down this

174
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,589
path. This sort of domino effect of like
well Joe said this, Joe said this, some

175
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:11,740
other guy said this. Trying  to piece together

176
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,480
something. So it doesn't technically make
sense as like a technical person would

177
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,420
read it. But somebody from the outside
and this is sort of where the danger is

178
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:26,260
is that somebody who isn't technical is
gonna read that and go "oh my dog, we're

179
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,430
gonna blame China, we're gonna blame all
these bad things" and the whole thing

180
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,010
with hardware implants and what this
article is really focusing on is the

181
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:37,120
danger of offshore manufacturing and
untrusted facilities in

182
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,290
hostile territories but hardware
implants can be done anywhere along the

183
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,250
lifecycle at any any manufacturing
facility it doesn't have to be offshore

184
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,310
it can be in the United States it could
be down the street because there's a

185
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,660
million ways to do it along the way. So
it's just, I think the article was very

186
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,069
unfair and especially to the to the
public sort of very misleading in a way

187
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,900
that now we have to deal with the
ramifications of that. 
[Kim:] But why is it

188
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,020
misleading if you're saying that the
capabilities are there, that everything

189
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:11,079
it's describing doing is possible and
it's raising awareness for looking for

190
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,940
hardware implants, it's raising the issue
of hardware implants. What's the problem, exactly?

191
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,570
[Joe G.:] I think raising awareness is great so being able to say here's a potential

192
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,270
problem. Here's an attack
vector people haven't looked at before

193
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:27,130
and raising that to the mainstream is
good. If there are no hard facts it's

194
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,550
misleading. So speculation is different if the

195
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,599
article was like "we think this happened.
This could happen. We think maybe this

196
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,330
happened." but they're basically
presenting it as here's you know even

197
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,900
the picture. Who's wearing the
shirt? So this shirt. Oh it's on the

198
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,709
screen. Yeah, so, that picture
with the pencil and that little thing on

199
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:49,420
top was in the article without a description of saying this is what we

200
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,099
think an implant would look like.
There's no mention. People thought that

201
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,120
picture which was in the article was the
actual implant discovered. But it

202
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,120
wasn't. The pictures they show of
where the implant could be on the

203
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,779
motherboard, where it zooms in, that
wasn't real either.

204
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:09,199
It's a lot of- from a high level it's good. 
[Kim:] But they do have sources saying, um not on

205
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,799
the record, I mean they're anonymous sources, we, they do have sources saying that

206
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,109
they've seen the implant. They've seen
reports of people who found the implants.

207
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:23,409
I'm still not convinced by you guys. What wrong with this article?

208
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,790
[Joe G.:] Oh, I will also say Joe and I were

209
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,450
contacted to speculate on where in the image that they could show

210
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,380
in there was the actual thing because
they're 17 anonymous sources didn't show

211
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:43,669
them an actual picture. 
[Mike G.:] It would be interesting to dive into the

212
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:52,220
implausibility of this, because while there's
potential in doing it the way it was

213
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,299
presented, but the practicality.
There's so many other approaches and it

214
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:01,580
might be worth distinguishing the different ways in which is plausible

215
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,350
whether it's hardware attacks versus
software firmware cetera and I think

216
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:12,559
those become more practical. 
[Kim:] Anyone else on the panel? 
[Joe F.:] Mickey, Mikey, Jason do you

217
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,590
have any ideas of how you would do it
that wouldn't involve nearly as much

218
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:24,070
hardware? 
[Mickey:] How much money you got?
[Audience Member:] Nation States.

219
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:32,000
[Mickey:] nation-states. So if we think
nation-states. Ok, so it's really

220
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,530
hard to talk about this topic without
going super technical, but if we consider

221
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:45,918
nation-state that has like a budget look
at the ANT catalog. What was the the cost for-

222
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,760
[Kim:] Just to make sure, does everyone in the room know what the ant catalog is?

223
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,700
Is there anyone who doesn't? The ant
catalog was leaked to Der Spiegel back

224
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:01,260
in 2013 or 2014. It was basically a catalog of the NSA's

225
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:08,820
implants spyware toolkit. It was, as I
recall, technology from 2008, but it

226
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,470
wasn't leaked until around 2014. So the
state of the art we presumably were a

227
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,820
decade on from that but it was quite sophisticated, the catalog.

228
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,110
[Mickey:] Yeah, keeping that in mind, a decade old technology in a catalog that has

229
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:28,409
implants on it that the cost of each
goes I think at least fifty thousand

230
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:34,380
dollars per unit and you can buy them in
packs. So if you have like 1.2 million

231
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,130
dollars you get a set of 50 or something like that. 
[Kim:] This was an actual catalog it

232
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,730
was a sales ordering catalog for spies.
[Mickey:] There are cheaper options, right? But

233
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:50,040
if we're thinking about that and
then moving our minds 10 years in the

234
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,300
future with the technology we have today
and thinking about, for example the

235
00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:00,030
nanometers then when manufacturing
versus nanometers now you can do a lot

236
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,740
of things in a really small package if
you have a lot of money. Now, let's say

237
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,320
you have the capability and the money.
You have an implant. You still have to

238
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,290
find the place on the board to put that
implant that gives you capabilities. Now

239
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:22,340
it's really hard to find a place on the
board to give you multiple capabilities

240
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:28,560
and that's why everything is possible,
but you'd have to adjust a few things in

241
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,710
the way. If you're a nation state and you
have spies and you've infiltrated the

242
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,630
supply chain there's so many ways you
can do this I don't even know where to

243
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:42,690
start. But let's say you just have an implant. 
[Joe F.:] So there's lots of ways to do it,

244
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,320
[Mickey:] Yeah. 
[Joe F.:] But do any of the ways you would do it involve making a custom chip, putting

245
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,899
it on a board in a place that doesn't
make sense in a package that you would

246
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:55,940
never find on a motherboard? 
[Mickey:] When you say it like that.
[ Audience Laughter ]

247
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,440
No, it's just a red flag. Yeah, I would totally do a fake package.

248
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:05,300
[Kim:] And why would you do it at the manufacturing plant? Why not do interdiction?

249
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:10,740
[Mickey:] I wouldn't do it in a manufacturing plant, but that's a different discussion. You don't want to know how I would do it.

250
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,000
[Kim:] We do actually, we do.

251
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,960
[Joe G.:] A lot of the discussion online and like this question is, well maybe the article is not right because they're doing it as a hardware

252
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,110
implant and not a software or firmware
one, but I'm not sure that's the right

253
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,560
way to go because it could possibly be a
hardware one. I don't know why they would

254
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,490
do it, right? But maybe there's a reason if they're doing, maybe

255
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,400
they're maybe they already have checks
in place during manufacturing to check

256
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,000
the state of firmware so they have to do
it after firmware to be manufactured

257
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,080
before you know as it's loaded to the
BMC in in powerup but not during

258
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,050
manufacturing, or something like that.
There might be a reason.

259
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,440
It seems completely ridiculous to any of us,
but we also don't know the whole story

260
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,820
if it was hardware and if so there are

261
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,790
plenty of ways to hide it, right? It's
just like if it was done right, it

262
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,280
wouldn't have been discovered and since
we haven't seen pictures we don't know

263
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,190
if it's been discovered, so, there might be a reason to do it but we

264
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,220
just don't. We haven't seen anything.
There's no proof at all. No proof, no

265
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:10,460
packet captures, no nothing. 
[Mickey:] Also, there's so many usual suspects in this chain.

266
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,920
In a motherboard you can name a lot of
companies that are involved in

267
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,760
manufacturing components to any
motherboard from any manufacturer. So

268
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,170
it's all based on trust. So if you trust the OEM that gives you

269
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:29,690
the component, that's good. But if someone infiltrated that one you can't tell.

270
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:35,990
[Kim:] So, have any of you ever found
suspicious malicious, let's say, implant

271
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:45,320
on a motherboard?
[Mickey:] No, I've never seen anything- 
I've seen dumb designs, but I've

272
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:53,870
not seen maliciously, a malicious implant.
Except what Mike did.
[Joe F.:] I've seen counterfeit bypass

273
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,850
devices. So you have, let's say a router
that's an 8 port router but its the

274
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,810
same board as the 16 port router.
And you go and you solder on

275
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:06,710
eight extra ports and you put this
bypass circuitry on there that

276
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,850
bypasses the DRM the manufacturer
puts on them. So you sell this. You buy a

277
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,510
$1,000 8 port switch, you solder
some components on and you sell it as a

278
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:19,220
$3,000 16 port switch, right? So it's
malicious. It's someone doing this to

279
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,900
swindle, to make money, but it's not a spy implant

280
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,800
It's the same, it would be the same hardware, right?

281
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,409
it would look exactly the same and if
you didn't know what you were doing you

282
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,100
saw this? That's what people- there
was a post on reddit a few years ago

283
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,389
someone who found an eBay purchase it
had one of these things on it and it was

284
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,710
pretty certain that it was a bypass, a
counterfeit bypass switch not an implant,

285
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:46,730
a spy implant. 
[Joe G.:] Yeah, that was on reddit, was that the Cisco router?

286
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,400
Someone bought one they and it looked
a little bit physically

287
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,280
different than the other one that they
bought and they open it up and there was

288
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,960
this hardware implant on there. It was like
an inch an inch square with no

289
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,430
silkscreen markings on it just this horrible
soldering job down onto the board, but a

290
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,030
huge discussion. You should search for Cisco implant reddit.

291
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,770
Tons of people trying to figure out
what it was and what we what we think it

292
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,100
is because there's only two connections
plus power and ground and I had actually

293
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,189
talked to a few people that had slightly
more insight than we do about what it

294
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,940
might be and they were thinking it was
bypassing, but basically a feature

295
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,910
upgrade, so during powerup and I don't know if

296
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:26,150
this is true for real, but during powerup
the system's gonna check a serial number

297
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,480
the state of something so this implant
is gonna modify that to basically give

298
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,810
it a different serial number or a
different key or whatever needs to be to

299
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,970
unlock the features that are already
existing on the board.

300
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,270
I think another good thing to think
about sort of Hardware implants in the

301
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,530
real world would be like mod chips on
game consoles right those are like

302
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,860
intentional hardware implants where
we're putting them there or somebody's

303
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,909
putting them there to, again, maybe be
malicious because they're bypassing some

304
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,750
security mechanism they probably aren't
spying. But it's that's like a real-world

305
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,870
hardware implant that I think everybody
has seen. As far as like malicious

306
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,370
intentional ones on boards I've never
seen it in my entire life of tearing

307
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,399
stuff apart and talking to people and I
would love to I'm just dying to see

308
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,940
something. You know, credit card skimmers are another implant and I've seen those

309
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,210
right those exist we know those exist,
but other stuff I'm just dying for

310
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,870
somebody to send us pictures or
something because we really want to see

311
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,620
one. Otherwise we can only speculate or kind of share what we would

312
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,989
do, but not know what the adversary is
really doing.

313
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,669
[Kim:] At the end of the table there, we haven't heard from you guys.
[Mike L:] So I think it's kind

314
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:31,520
of interesting to think about mod chips.
Where in the the console market the

315
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,070
adversary that's implanting hardware is
definitely in scope into their threat

316
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,279
model. This is exactly what they're
afraid of.

317
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,010
It's a cat-and-mouse game.
Whereas in the server motherboard

318
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:45,360
business, this seems to be something that
we don't talk about and is generally

319
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,549
thought of as outside of the threat model. 
[Mickey:] I just want to add something. I don't think we'll ever

320
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:59,010
see an implant like the one suggested.
Alright, with the gaming and modding

321
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:03,629
communities, the user can sense to know
that there is something on it. He accepts

322
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,240
the fact there's something there, I
wanted there because I want to play all

323
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,789
my games. When a malicious actor
tries to add a component, a malicious

324
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:16,080
component, to a board the user should not
know. So you shouldn't you should be able

325
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,340
to detect it unless the malicious user knows how to. 
[Kim:] Well the interesting

326
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,580
thing and the way that they
described that it was detected was the

327
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:29,809
traffic going out to the server. 
[Mickey:] That's another discussion

328
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:41,250
Are we going to talk about that point?
[Kim:] Yes I'm asking you about it. 
[Mickey:] I'll let Joe start.

329
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,220
[ Audience Laughter ]
[Kim:] So, I guess we're getting into the issue of like how do

330
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:50,419
you detect, unless anyone else wants to continue on-
[Mike G.:] I'd like to add one more point to the practicality.

331
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:56,190
with, for instance this little thing,
right? In terms of practicality here this

332
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:00,990
is mobile. It's not the system itself. It
comes with the human aspect.

333
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:05,460
Therefore it kind of makes sense. Doing a
hardware implant on the physical system

334
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,029
itself, there's a lot more complications
and, look, we don't know the whole

335
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:13,620
complexity the intent and the
constraints they had here we're just

336
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,209
talking generally as a general approach.
But it's it's a lot easier to go at the

337
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:22,260
firmware or the software level even even
this it immediately hands off the

338
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,510
software it's like okay it's infected
now it's in the system then it's done.

339
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:31,080
That is where it's much easier, it's much
more flexible, you're in the user space

340
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,590
when you you're at the hardware level
there's some so many more constraints

341
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,419
and anytime something changes on that

342
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,800
hardware, a flash update, your hardware implant may therefore

343
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,419
break and potentially catastrophically, to
the point where somebody notices that it

344
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,150
is implanted. And you don't want that,
especially when it's at a large scale

345
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:53,850
when it's coming from the source. And you
have a lot less control of where it ends up.

346
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:59,219
[Kim:] Before we get into the the detection, there was a second story

347
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,880
that came out from Bloomberg afterwards
and it seemed to be a follow up to the

348
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,470
first story, but then it was talking
about something different. This one was

349
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:12,810
by a guy from Sepio Systems Yossi
Appelbaum, who said that he found this on

350
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:17,659
a telecom, didn't identify the telecom.
And the way that they discovered it was

351
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,980
unusual communications from a Supermicro server and a subsequent physical

352
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,600
inspection revealed an implant built
into the server's Ethernet connector. So

353
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,100
in the first story they were talking
about this implant on the motherboard

354
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:38,580
that then communicates. It calls home to
this malicious server and apparently all

355
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,409
of the implants were calling out to the
same server because supposedly some

356
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:48,570
Intel source then got access to this
server and they were seeing what systems

357
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,300
were communicating with it and that's
how they were able to determine that

358
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:57,120
about 30 companies were affected by this.
So, let's throw that to the panel and

359
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,310
talk about that method of discovery and
other methods let's say the plausibility

360
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:07,500
of that first and then in general how
you might discover an implant. 
[Mickey:] Okay, I'll

361
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,420
start. If I take your description
literally and I think about it for a

362
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:18,270
second that sounds like a BMC. So that
that's, if you don't know, BMC stands

363
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:25,100
for baseboard management controller.
It's a separate subsystem that is

364
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:32,459
located on most servers. Allows companies to manage their fleet of servers.

365
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,350
reset them, install operating systems,
it's a completely separate stack of

366
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:43,350
operating system on a motherboard. Some of them share a network port with

367
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:48,870
the motherboard. It's described like the BMC

368
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,760
was contacting somewhere and that
sounds like a firmware or software kind

369
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,220
of exploit than the hardware one to me.

370
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,960
[Joe G.:] I just want to add a little backstory to that particular article and

371
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,800
then someone can talk more technically
about it. So yes a

372
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,070
modified ethernet connector
sounds like a totally different

373
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:15,149
description of the implant than the
first one. This particular company, this

374
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,990
second article, we don't know if that
article was was meant to be a you know

375
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,750
was in the works at the same time as the
first one and this sort of brings into

376
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:27,200
into fact the whole questionable ethics I think around this this article

377
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,440
when the first article dropped that
weekend I got an email from a company

378
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,090
somebody at a company named Sepio and they said hey Joe I saw you in the Bloomberg

379
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:40,350
article I'd like to show you how we're
securing hardware. And I got a million

380
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,830
emails that day or that weekend so I
just blew it off and then when

381
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,510
the second article came out, Sepio Systems was featured in the article. I

382
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:53,280
was like, huh? Did they reach out to
Bloomberg after the first article to say

383
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,490
they have a solution to this problem and
this is a great way that they can now

384
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:00,090
also convince the journalists you know
to write about it? So the second article

385
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:04,559
to me seemed like not an intentional
follow-up, but a follow up to maybe try

386
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,520
to bolster their first article and come
out with something of saying look

387
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,030
implants are real, so you should trust
our first article. Here's a company that

388
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:16,920
specializes in securing or detecting
implants so it must be real, So the whole

389
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,490
thing was just sort of shady and the fact they were providing a service

390
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:24,300
and the fact that they just cold-call
reached out to me. It didn't sit

391
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,600
right, but again you know from a
functional perspective hacking an

392
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,870
ethernet connector and implanting that's
a great place to hide because it's huge,

393
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,500
right, and you could do something in
there and add add stuff with within the

394
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,290
connector itself, but there was some
technical inefficiencies I guess would

395
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,530
be a word of that article too where
they're saying that you know the this

396
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:47,760
particular physical Ethernet connector
that was detected was was plastic

397
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,840
instead of metal or no metal instead of
plastic so the metal you know it act as

398
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,559
a better heat sink for any of the
processing power implanted inside of it

399
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:02,309
additionally. Which must be why it's implanted

400
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:06,989
and oh and the end the way it was
detected was not just ethernet traffic

401
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:10,979
it was the current power consumption
measured based on I don't even know I'm

402
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:13,489
not even a try to make sense-
[Kim:] It said unusual communications and that's all it said.

403
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:19,499
[Joe F.:] Sepio Systems sells a service where they can detect your maliciously

404
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:23,729
implanted ethernet ports. They
claim to have found these ports, but they

405
00:32:23,729 --> 00:32:27,599
can't tell you any details about how.
They claim they do this by doing analog

406
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,619
signatures and stuff like that sounds
like side channel analysis. Side

407
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:37,529
channel analysis is complicated. These journalists are translating and so

408
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:42,059
that description is a translation of
some detection mechanism they use to

409
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:45,450
detect anomalies using side channel analysis. 
[Kim:]This is how the journalist

410
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:51,599
translated it. They talk about the Sepio
software detected the implant "One

411
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,479
of the few ways to identify suspicious
hardware is by looking at the lowest

412
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:58,889
levels of network traffic. Those include
not only normal network transmissions

413
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:03,059
but also analog signals, such as power
consumption, that can indicate the

414
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,969
presence of a covert piece of hardware."
So they're not saying that the power

415
00:33:05,969 --> 00:33:09,299
consumption was one of the ways that
this particular telecom implant was

416
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:13,200
found, but they're talking about Sepio's
capabilities and how they might find an

417
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,361
implant. 
[Joe F.:] Yeah, so great great marketing piece.
[ Audience Laughter ]

418
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:26,399
[Kim:] Can I just add one other technical detail about this particular ethernet connector? "The tampered Supermicro

419
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,839
server actually appeared on the network
as two devices in one. The legitimate

420
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,950
server was communicating one way, and the implant another, but all the traffic

421
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,349
appeared to be coming from the same
trusted server which allowed it to

422
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:45,210
bypass security filters." 
[Jason:] What joe said earlier about

423
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:50,879
these things being presented in a language that is

424
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:53,580
fairly generic super high level that you have to

425
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:57,178
look at these things through that lens of

426
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,599
interpreting. Okay, well this is sort of
what they meant. This is sort

427
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:06,178
of in in the realm of very high
extremely abstracted possibility. I think

428
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:11,069
that that's partly where we start to get
into like, "for whose benefit is this

429
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:15,570
article?" and then the follow-up article
which definitely kind of reeks of

430
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:21,120
opportunism. If that wasn't already in
the works, there's

431
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,880
no actual evidence that's been presented.
There's sort of like a somewhat pseudo-plausible

432
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,920
technical mechanism, which we all here have

433
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,460
experience with and that I don't think
is in any dispute whatsoever. We can all

434
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:40,070
sit down and think of hundreds and
thousands of different ways of

435
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:44,640
back dooring stuff either
whether it's intentional implants

436
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,739
or we haven't even talked about bug
doors, which make actually adding

437
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:57,660
something kind of irrelevant, but that we
have to ask like well who's

438
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,690
benefiting from this article and what does this article

439
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:05,130
actually- what information and what are people supposed to do

440
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,150
with it? I mean almost nobody deals with

441
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,440
server hardware anyway. They have no idea how to interpret

442
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,690
this and what to do with the information.
So they've presented

443
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:22,530
no real hard evidence that

444
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:28,170
anybody who's willing to stand up and
actually put their credibility on the

445
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:34,740
line that they're not that isn't selling
something. So, you guys want to

446
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:41,189
talk about for who's benefit?
[Joe F.:] One question. Mickey, Jason, you guys know BMCs

447
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:46,290
better than than I do. How difficult is
it to make servers show up as to network

448
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,190
devices that were a single port. Is that
like a core feature of some of these

449
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,820
BMCs maybe?
[ Audience Laughter ]

450
00:35:53,610 --> 00:36:15,220
[Mickey:] That's exactly how it works. 
[Joe F.:] So there's a question "is there anybody who's done

451
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,000
research on BMCs and knows details
about how things like this can work?" And

452
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,420
yes there are, and yes they have. 
[Mickey:] We have one in the audience. 
[Joe F.:] Do you want us to

453
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,260
say your name or do you want us to not say your name? Say hi to Jesse. Come talk to him later.

454
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,260
[Mickey:] That's Jesse. 
[Joe F.:] Sign up for a volunteer

455
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:38,020
position while you're talking to him. [ Audience Laughter ] 
[Mike L.:] I think like we need to

456
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,950
think about when we talk about
this detected network traffic and

457
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:46,660
it's it's sort of hinted that this is an
implanted hardware that is making

458
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:51,759
network traffic and some kind of side
channel, which is not necessary at all.

459
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,520
You can, through the BMC, you can
make network traffic through the

460
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,600
implanted hardware talking on the same
buses is the BMC. You can also make

461
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:07,230
network traffic and like there would be
no network detectable side channel

462
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:12,220
signature of that that would be
indistinguishable because it's sent by

463
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:19,930
the same ethernet controller so like
that didn't really those two details

464
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:23,549
don't really go together. They don't make
really make a whole lot of sense to me.

465
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,460
[Joe G.:] Well here's a question related to
detection not being a network or

466
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,130
software person but a lot of the
discussion is you know there's a

467
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,830
detected of the hardware implant because there has to be some

468
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:36,850
command and control or something. Yes you can generate traffic, but from the

469
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,970
people I've heard in the network world
that are looking for these things now

470
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:45,959
and spending a lot of time doing it
they seem pretty confident that any

471
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,080
irregular or malicious sort of network
traffic they would be able to detect

472
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,069
because intrusion detection in all of
that world of detecting network stuff is

473
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,150
so good and I don't know if you agree
with that I only know that I've read you

474
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,560
know stories of hacks I remember what
what exfiltration it was of like Sony or

475
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,710
some company where there was like some
huge amount of gigabytes of data being

476
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,330
exfiltrated straight over the network
and no

477
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:11,560
one detected it. It seems unlikely you
know sometimes companies might not even

478
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,980
detect a few bytes being sent but what I
mean do you think even if it's a

479
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,910
hardware implant could it be detected
properly in a software approach in

480
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,790
networker is there just too much ways to hide? 
[Mickey:] I want to answer that with a

481
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:29,100
question to you. Would you do a hardware
implant that talks over the network?

482
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,799
[Joe G.:] Probably not. 
[Mickey.:] Exactly.

483
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,850
[Joe G.:] I would do one that would exfiltrate data in a different

484
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:37,000
way not over the network so it wouldn't
be detected and then we get into covert

485
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,660
channels through you know 
EM or RF or optical or whatever.

486
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,700
[Joe F.:] You bring up the example is Sony getting gigabytes of data exfiltrated but we're not talking

487
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,569
about Sony we're talking about Amazon
and Apple. Their jobs are

488
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:53,200
maintaining farms of servers they are
really good at this they're probably the

489
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,710
best in the world and the other 30
companies on it list are probably up

490
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:01,210
there. When you have a cloud service you have a bunch of

491
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:04,540
systems that are running other people's
code and you're very careful about what

492
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,910
you do. When you're building your
network when you're building a server

493
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,899
you have a box around everything right
and if you're not trusting the software

494
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,820
on the system or the operating system-
[Audience:] Are you asserting that they are really careful about their-

495
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,060
[Joe F.:] Thank you for catching me on that

496
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:38,740
maybe my wording was optimistic so when
you are threat modeling a data center

497
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,669
you have a box around each server. You
are already suspicious of strange

498
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,460
traffic coming out of it. You're
suspicious of strange traffic coming out

499
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,600
of the BMC. Whether or not they do a good
job of detecting that or not is in

500
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,940
question, but this is the job they're supposed to be doing. So I

501
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,170
assume without information that
companies who are doing this on huge

502
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:02,860
scales are doing a better job than
smaller companies even Sony is a much

503
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,940
smaller company who just has their own
little like 30-some gigabyte

504
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:12,430
exfiltration problem. 
[Mike G.] I just want to add
so in the scenario where there is an

505
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,060
additional network interface popping up. That's the

506
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,660
equivalent of having a whole new machine
just suddenly pop up in your network

507
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,460
that is the loudest way from a network
analysis standpoint to approach this

508
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:31,240
so, even just basic IDS stuff is going to
catch a whole machine suddenly showing

509
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:36,359
up in your network.
[Audience:] No it won't.
[Joe G.:] Everyone's saying no.

510
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:46,379
[Audience:] So the counterpoint that, if you're infrastructure is all VMs you're creating and destroying VMs constantly.

511
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:50,490
[Joe G.:] So the comment was if you have

512
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:57,729
virtual infrastructure with a bunch of VMs you're creating and destroying VMs all the time so if one pops up in there you may not see it, but

513
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,030
what about even from a lower level like
again I don't I don't delve into any

514
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,630
network stuff but it seems like with
exfiltrating data from a hardware

515
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,260
perspective there's so many ways. Aren't
there ways within network traffic to

516
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,590
just change some bits of a flag or
something that would go undetected and

517
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,830
someone could still do for command and
control? It's not infeasible

518
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,630
that network traffic could get through
whatever detection mechanisms. It's

519
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,980
just is that maybe just maybe unlikely?

520
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:33,069
Yeah, once you know once you know where
to look. That's what the article is saying

521
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:39,779
they've detected it. we should have PCAP,  yes. 
[Joe F.:] My mistake is...

522
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:54,520
my error is speaking beyond my expertise

523
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,990
which is the hardware side of things and
my thought is once we get to the

524
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,020
network level there's no difference
between a hardware implant and software

525
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:06,250
and then they already have these
mechanisms in a software world they may

526
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,420
not be perfect, but they're gonna find
things in cases. When we detect

527
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,349
something and we detect it and isolate
it there's no reason we can't come up

528
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:19,690
with a PCAP, an Indicator of Compromise of what this thing does. If we detect

529
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:24,069
it, if we find it, if it exists. We don't
have that. We have nothing to

530
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:26,380
look for right now so when you get down
to the question of like what do we do

531
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,849
about it which is kind of where you try
to direct the conversation like we don't

532
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:35,079
know what to do in response to this
article because we don't know what the

533
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:39,010
attack was that we can detect. 
[Kim:] So maybe you don't know specifically this one, but

534
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:41,770
what would be the advice then to people

535
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:48,160
in data centers and CISOs and CTOs in
general about this issue of implants. I

536
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,359
mean, okay, not this one specifically
maybe, but- 
[Joe G.:] I feel like we have to be

537
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:57,609
careful I mean I feel like this
is not a not a new attack vector for us

538
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:00,640
but potentially a new attack vector for
other people and I think we have to sort

539
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,190
of we don't want to go out there and
scare everybody with this.

540
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:09,849
We need to be kind of a voice
of reason like we try to do with every

541
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:14,890
other attack that comes out but I think and Joe and I and

542
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:17,680
probably some of the other guys too, and
probably a lot of people in

543
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,848
here have gotten questions about what do
we do in relation to this and you don't

544
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,000
want to totally discount it because it
is a real threat but it's also like we

545
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,180
talked about there are lots of other
ways to do it. What I've been spending

546
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,720
time doing with CISOs and things is not
scaring them but saying it's a

547
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,279
possibility. You're relying on commercial
you know off-the-shelf hardware you're

548
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,400
dealing with manufacturers all over the
world you're trusting all these

549
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,490
different things along the way yes
things could happen. Is it likely? Not as

550
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,910
likely as somebody compromising firmware or phishing your employees or something.

551
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,680
So I think it's mostly what I've just
bringing it to light and saying yes it

552
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,669
exists. Is it likely? No. And then they
have to deal with you know they have

553
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:58,910
they understand their business to
understand like what what do they

554
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:03,440
actually- do they need to go deeper in
that way or can they just you know now

555
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,559
be aware of it but maybe not spend a lot of time on it. 
[Joe F.:] I think Matt King I quoted

556
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:16,280
him he he said to me like if you're not,
sorry, if you don't have hardware attacks

557
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,940
in your threat model but watching the
wording if you don't have hardware

558
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,819
attacks already in your threat model
this is the wake-up call to do it and

559
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:26,150
that's what you need to do. You need to
worry about the next generation. You need to

560
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:29,750
worry about talking to your suppliers
about supply chain security tearing

561
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,869
apart a few motherboards looking for
little white chips is not gonna help you.

562
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:36,500
It's a waste of time. It's a waste of
money. But having that conversation with

563
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,520
your suppliers if you've never had it
before? This is why you need to have that

564
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,079
conversation. 
[Mike L.:] And I think that it's also the same sort of detective

565
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:48,799
control things that we've been talking
about for a long time. You need to

566
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:52,190
think about the possibility of a
compromise BMC and what that BMC

567
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:59,420
can reach. If you have a flat BMC Network,
one BMC can reach all BMCs, that might be something to look at again.

568
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:05,630
[ Audience Laughter ]
[Kim:] Does anyone want to add to that because I want to open

569
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:10,609
up to questions from the audience if
there's nothing else to add. Okay, does

570
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:13,130
does anyone have any questions? Let's take from here first and

571
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:16,680
I guess I'll have to repeat the question
so everyone can hear.

572
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:22,759
[Audience:] Going back to what Jason said about "who's benefitting from this?" It's all well and good for us

573
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:28,380
to talk about it and make fun of the Bloomberg article and so forth, but we're not the audience for this article.

574
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:37,820
The audience for this article is the general public, who has already been trolled and swayed on a lot of stupid things.

575
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:44,160
In Facebook and so forth. They've upped their game now to Bloomberg, but it may just be, to what extent

576
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,180
do you think we're just doing this to sow more FUD in the system?

577
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:57,420
[Joe G.:] There was an article that came out. So the question in a nutshell

578
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:02,790
is basically who's whose benefit is this
article for and there's been so much FUD,

579
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:07,710
fear, uncertainty and doubt, in the media.
What's the point that we're not the

580
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:10,920
main audience it's the the rest of the
world is the main audience and what are

581
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,609
the real reasons? We don't we
don't fully know but there was an

582
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:19,080
article that came out about Bloomberg
reporting a few years ago and I don't

583
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,170
know if this is still true that
apparently Bloomberg journalists get

584
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:25,890
bonuses based on how they move the
markets so how the markets are

585
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:33,359
influenced based on their articles. The
stock of Supermicro dropped 40-something

586
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,569
percent when the article came out and
it's been coming back up so a great time

587
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,780
to buy, maybe. Yeah so they're sort of that theory

588
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,580
maybe you know maybe it's just unethical
reporting people have said well you know

589
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,549
with the whole Trump China tariff thing
the article came out it's just the right

590
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:50,520
time another China bashing thing and
that's why I mentioned it doesn't have

591
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,440
to be China
you know implants could happen anywhere

592
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,670
but yeah maybe it's used for political
ammunition. The fact that the article has

593
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:01,470
been in the works for so long is sort of
like well maybe maybe not but yeah you

594
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:05,129
just don't you don't really know the
motivations and but when I read an

595
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:10,349
article that uh that Dan Gere had sent
me from Michael Crichton from 2002 I

596
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:13,440
think he was giving a talk and I don't
exactly I remember where it was but he

597
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,980
was basically saying, you know from a
technical perspective if you're a

598
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,130
technical person and you read a
technical article you go oh there's all

599
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,530
these problems with it this journalist
doesn't know what they're talking about

600
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:25,859
but then you go read the rest of the
paper and just assume all the other

601
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:30,330
journalists about things you don't know
about our correct, but it just puts this

602
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:34,529
weird lens on things of once you realize
that something you read from your world

603
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:37,530
is wrong it makes you question
everything else too

604
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,710
so I don't know I don't know the
motivations I from one hand though I do

605
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:44,940
you know to maybe not to Bloomberg's
credit but the emails. It seemed like the

606
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:49,110
journalists were actually like generally
interested and excited about this like

607
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:52,740
they found something and I think maybe
there was some piece of technical

608
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:57,450
incompetence and being fed information
in a way that they thought they were

609
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:01,169
doing this amazing service when in
reality it just confused the hell out of

610
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:05,310
everybody. 
[Kim:] I do want to just add from a
journalist perspective that this story

611
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:08,279
is sort of at the Nexus of two of the
most difficult things for a journalist

612
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,910
to cover, and that is national security,
classified information. Because you got

613
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:14,580
sources that aren't necessarily going to
be able to give you the whole picture

614
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:17,759
but they'll give you pieces of it and
you may have different sources in

615
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,640
different areas will give a piece here,
a piece here, a piece here and

616
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,589
your job then is try and pull this all
together in a viable way and a plausible

617
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:29,610
way. Attach that, the technical issue
where you've got two reporters who don't

618
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,640
necessarily have a background in
technology don't have a good track

619
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,569
record in covering technology and so you
have two possible problems here with

620
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:41,520
where you're going to run into issues.
Anyway, open it back up to the to the

621
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:51,000
audience and take one from over here? Yeah.
[Audience:] Aside from the BMC, are there other areas on the motherboard that would make a tiny bit more sense

622
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,900
to take advantage of to perform malicious activities?

623
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:07,310
[Joe F.:] So are there other places you would build

624
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,460
something in? Other places that would
be easier and more effective to do this?

625
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:15,620
When I read the article and I see
the details and put them together with

626
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,190
full information what this tells me
is I²C. I²C is a two-wire

627
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:22,250
interface. It connects a lot of
low-level sensors and things on a

628
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:26,330
motherboard and it's very easy to
build a little four chip thing that

629
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,900
speaks I²C and talks to all
these devices. It's simple. its

630
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,520
low-power, it's very well understood and
it connects very important things in the

631
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,870
chip. I've seen systems that have I²C routed in ways that let you

632
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:43,730
have debug capability of chips on the
board over I²C. I've seen

633
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,070
systems where you know you can write
software that will be able to

634
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:49,880
communicate over I²C and tell
devices to turn on and off features on

635
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,720
the board. Power ranges on the board.
Clocks on the board. So we do have a lot

636
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,939
of potential for things like this but
again that's not what the article was

637
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:11,840
telling us about. Maybe you guys want to add to that?
[Jason:] Little things, I mean, TPMs are a great

638
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:17,720
one. I actually don't work for NCC group anymore I resigned

639
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,100
on Wednesday, but so I'm not shilling for my former employer, but

640
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:27,110
on of my colleagues, we did a gig on some server

641
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:30,260
hardware that a company was deploying
and remote data centers and one of the

642
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,640
things that we started poking at was
there was like the TPMs on a lot of

643
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,509
servers are on some sort of expander card
or daughter card that's just entirely

644
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:42,440
removable it's this little extra card
you have no idea what's on what's what's

645
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,940
on this little daughter card like all
things like that we found a whole bunch

646
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:50,600
of bugs in all of the in all of the
software that speaks with the TPM both

647
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:57,259
in UEFI and in things like tboot for doing measured in the

648
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,870
tested boot as I'll look at the
chipsec people and stuff like that what

649
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:07,509
I want when I say this because those guys helped me fix those bugs, but

650
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:11,230
that's where like, as joe says, there's
all all sorts of

651
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:15,340
different kinds of peripherals that
speak on different kinds of busses,

652
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:20,830
especially the I²C stuff. I²C- 
[Jason:] Wait, hold on so you're

653
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:25,270
saying, so Jason, you're saying TPM
trusted platform module I'm being

654
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:29,560
sarcastic a part that's supposed to be providing

655
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:35,200
hardware security for a motherboard can
be man in the middle then tampered with?

656
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,040
so basically the attempt of the
motherboard world to try to have

657
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,490
something secure can be tampered with
because it's over I squared C or over

658
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:46,779
something else right?  
[Jason:] Maybe I'll take this opportunity to make a bold claim and say that basically a

659
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,500
physical attacker wasn't really in the
threat model for TPMs at all.

660
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,640
[Joe G.:] But they should be. 
[Jason:] Well, yeah. it very much should have

661
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,680
been. So this is changing and this is things that the TCG or the

662
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,509
Trusted Computing Group that manages all
the standards that that go into things

663
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:08,109
like TPMs and stuff like that define what they are. I mean, they are

664
00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:13,420
aware of this and they are today are trying to fix it. 
[Joe F.:] it used to be that

665
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,570
physical access like the actual
ability to touch the system and

666
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:20,740
manipulate it and attack it that's only
in the threat model for game consoles

667
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:25,990
and then we've added phones to that
it's the most part. We don't have that

668
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:30,669
threat model built into the past 60
years of building computers right. We

669
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,220
have cases where suddenly we realize it
is in the threat model where we have

670
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:36,490
the flipped laptop over and reprogram the BIOS because you stole

671
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,399
someone's laptop and you want to bypass
their login password stuff like that

672
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,180
evil maid attacks. Evil maid attacks
or this like hey we need to consider

673
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:47,350
physical attacks on laptops and now this
is hey we need to consider physical

674
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:50,950
attacks on server. So we need to look at
our threat models we look at our

675
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:55,089
planning process in our design process
and realize hey is physical access

676
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:58,780
something we need to be concerned about
or is it more realistic for us to build

677
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,920
more secure software and have this
constraint and say hey this server must

678
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,010
not get physical access by anyone
including anyone in the supply chain

679
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:09,880
[Joe G.:] That's actually that's an
interesting point because even most

680
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,310
chips that are out there if you've
worked with with designing a low-level

681
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:17,259
Hardware there including the TPM any
interface on the board there's very few

682
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,859
cases where there's actually protection
of data in transit

683
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:23,680
or any encryption or any authentication.
The chips themselves don't support it

684
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,200
because going back to physical access
was never a threat. The problem is, even

685
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:33,038
though physical access is now a threat,
there still aren't solutions for that

686
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,970
and there won't be for a while. Until the chips themselves have enough

687
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:41,169
security built in where doing Hardware
interdiction or Hardware implant is

688
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:44,859
gonna make it way harder you know
engineers aren't gonna implement

689
00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:47,470
security on their own it's just not
going to happen. So everything's in the

690
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:53,649
clear including TPM including I²C including SPI the LPC bus the the POST

691
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:56,980
bus like all this stuff is totally open
and any of those could be implantable

692
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:01,390
whether it's gonna have the same result
as the Super Micro which presumably was

693
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:04,210
about the BMC we don't know but there's
lots of places to implant because things

694
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,450
are just everyone's talking in the clear
on the boards. 
[Mike L.:] Well I think it's kind of

695
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:11,319
interesting to look at D TPM
because like the hardware threat model of

696
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:15,880
the D TPM is like well we have the
secure element which is you know all all

697
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:20,289
fipsy and it keeps your secret,
but it's not within the threat

698
00:54:20,289 --> 00:54:24,039
model to say like oh I could make an
evil TPM that has different properties

699
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:28,089
or does something else. It's all
about does this thing have the security

700
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:31,150
does this little element have the security properties

701
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,359
that you assume it has. 
[Joe F.:] Mike can you tell me a little more about people's

702
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:37,989
assumptions of hardware security items
and whether they should trust them or

703
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:47,950
not implicitly? Like YubiKeys? Are they good? I think

704
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:52,390
they're an improvement. 
[Mike L.] You know we we don't trust software because we can

705
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:58,299
inspect it we know it's made of crap. So
what we need is we need something

706
00:54:58,299 --> 00:55:02,319
immutable, something perfect
and wonderful like hardware

707
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:06,308
and we don't want it to be crap so
we want to make it so we can't inspect

708
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:10,420
it. So it must not be crap
because we can't inspect it and

709
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:14,019
therefore everything is good.
Unfortunately the world we live in now

710
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:20,109
is that we have people who wanted to
make hardware who didn't learn how to

711
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:24,098
write software that now write software that makes hardware.

712
00:55:24,099 --> 00:55:30,910
[Joe G.:] don't you have some of those pieces in your little pouch?

713
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,520
[Mike L.:] I do have some Doobie keys. It's just like a

714
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:38,270
YubiKey except for it has the opposite
security properties of a YubiKey. Instead

715
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:46,490
of keeping your secret deep
inside and being unwilling to have it

716
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:50,120
extracted even by an advanced adversary,
every time you plug it in it just sprays

717
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:55,160
it to everybody. 
[Joe F.:] Luckily it doesn't look
that much like a Yubikey.

718
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:00,920
[Kim:] Let's take a question over here.

719
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:09,480
[Audience:] So, Jason or Mike said something i think that is pretty- The future is we're all not using hardware.

720
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:20,220
Businesses, right? Nike's shifting over to the cloud. Like their entire infrastructure, right? So no one's having a conversation with their hardware manufacturers.

721
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:24,580
It's Apple and Amazon that are having discussions with their hardware manufacturers.We're down stream from that.

722
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:30,620
[Kim:] Did everyone hear the question?
[Joe G.:] Yeah the cloud is just other people's

723
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:34,279
computers, right? The big companies aren't manufacturing their own,

724
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,540
they're just using somebody else's
service and you're just now trusting

725
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:42,350
that the provider of that service is
talking to the manufacturers and doing

726
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:45,470
things properly and yeah you're there
there's risk along the way. There's

727
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:48,709
Turtles all the way down, or something.
I don't know if that's the right saying, but it sounds good.

728
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:50,420
[Joe F.:] The question was about

729
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,450
when everybody's going cloud what power do we have

730
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:56,569
we just have software we don't trust the
hardware. If we look at phones

731
00:56:56,570 --> 00:57:00,380
right the iPhone you've got one model
that is like every single iPhone it's

732
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:03,260
the same they build the security
qualities in and it's identical for

733
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:06,470
every one. When we have a situation where
every single company is having their own

734
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,779
hardware server and they're buying from
a different manufacturer and all this

735
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:12,650
stuff. There's a huge realm of
what's possible and what's breakable and

736
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:18,380
it's just the effort for security goes
into one model of one server and it is

737
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,010
less efficient. When we go to the model
where we have these cloud providers

738
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:26,690
right. Apple, Amazon, Google. They're gonna put the effort into unifying their

739
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:29,900
architecture instead of putting all this
effort into securing one model that's

740
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,230
you know they sell a million servers
they put all the you know 10 times the

741
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:36,530
effort because they're selling 10
million servers so there is benefit

742
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:40,880
there to having this homogeneous ation
and having this you know offload this

743
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,420
like you know people don't know how to
handle Hardware issues they're having

744
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:48,710
trouble with software she's why we're
going to cloud so I think there's a

745
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:52,190
potential that these companies are gonna
have a better grasp of this and after

746
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:55,970
some news maybe they will put more
effort into supply chain security I

747
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:59,450
think we're headed in the right
direction but we're not there yet that's for sure.

748
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:11,000
[Kim: ] Yeah, go ahead.
[Audience:] I'm really interested in the journalism aspect of this story. I'm interested in your opinion about was this article

749
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,860
appropriate to have ever been published to begin with given they rely solely on anonymous sources?

750
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:27,180
What would you advise to people communicating with journalists about technical stories? Would it make sense to have published the second story that had far more technical details

751
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:33,379
so that we wouldn't spend a whole bunch of time just talking about what- reading the tea leaves in the article? That kind of stuff.

752
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:40,280
[Kim:] Did everyone hear the question? Okay, so just quickly he's wondering like

753
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:42,480
should the article have been published
at all or how should have been done

754
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,580
differently should have been followed up
with a more technical article? I don't

755
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:50,430
think that they could do a more
technical article, because I don't think

756
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:55,770
that they had the capabilities in
staff for someone to do it. I think that

757
00:58:55,770 --> 00:59:02,970
the, so, it's tough. They're citing 17
and not anonymous sources that's a lot

758
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:07,080
of anonymous sources but we don't know
the quality of those sources and they're

759
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:11,009
saying top-level intelligence officials. We have to trust what

760
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:14,160
that means. When you're a journalist and
you're trying to give someone anonymity

761
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,910
you're trying to give them distance from
their knowledge of something because you

762
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:20,970
don't want to say top official in the
White House because that's too narrow,

763
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:26,370
right? So you want to broaden it and make
it as broad a description of this expert

764
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:30,390
as you can so someone can't really
identify them. So top Intel official can

765
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:35,850
be multitudes of many things, right?
they're saying that the investigation is

766
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:40,200
done by counter-intel of FBI, so that maybe
could narrow it. These were maybe top FBI

767
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:44,640
counter-intel officials, we don't know. That
you know it's a problem for other

768
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,120
journalists I there was a really great
quote in The Washington Post done by

769
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,390
their media writer who said good
journalism should be able to be reverse

770
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:55,560
engineered other journalists should be
able to follow up the story I mean we

771
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,620
often see that right? You get a story
let's say the New York Times breaks

772
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:03,600
a story about warrantless wiretapping,
from the Bush administration, in 2006 and

773
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,690
it's immediately followed up with other
stories from the Washington Post and

774
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:09,990
from other outlets who then go to their
sources and they're able to confirm this.

775
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:13,410
No one else is able to confirm this in
part because there aren't a lot of

776
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:18,569
details that you can pick up on, but even
the detail of a manufacturing

777
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:22,400
plant in China a chip found in
Supermicro there are enough really

778
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,740
specific details in here that every
journalist should be able to go back to

779
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:30,299
their own intel sources and say what's
up and we all got blank stares. We don't

780
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:36,780
know. So I don't want to dismiss the article entirely. The

781
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:42,210
plausibility is there, of implants. I
agree with Joe that maybe there were

782
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:44,260
wire crossed and they got information from

783
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:47,619
here that they combined with information
here combined with information over here

784
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:54,940
and it's sort of a conglomeration of mud
in the end. With some concern still.

785
01:00:54,940 --> 01:01:01,000
[Audience:] How do you protect yourself in journalism from sources who are pushing-

786
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,879
[Kim:] Who have an agenda. Every source has an agenda. Joe has an agenda. Everyone on

787
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,450
this panel when they speak to a
journalist has an agenda. You can decide

788
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:16,899
whether or not their agenda is is benign
helpful to the reader or malicious or

789
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:20,890
political or whatever, but every source
has an agenda.

790
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:25,089
That doesn't make them a bad source. You
just as a journalist, your job is to know

791
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:28,869
what the agenda is and the work around
it. Is the agenda that they're trying to

792
01:01:28,869 --> 01:01:31,930
pull one over on you? Well you don't
rely on one source right you want to get

793
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:37,210
multiple sources and weigh
information against each other. But yeah,

794
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:40,480
everyone has an agenda and so you have
to figure out- and even a whistle blower

795
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,710
right? Everyone always says whistle
blowers are disgruntled workers. That

796
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:49,420
doesn't disqualify what they have to
blow the whistle about. So it doesn't

797
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:55,690
matter if someone's agenda is a negative
if it's a revenge payback whatever. What

798
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:58,839
you want to focus on is the journalist
is the information is it is it viable

799
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:02,950
information? Can you confirm it? That's what it comes down to. 
[Joe G.:] I think to go

800
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:07,629
along to answer Jared's question in
relation to that is every source might

801
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:11,470
have an agenda, but every journalist has
an agenda. Alright, so that's the thing

802
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:14,950
to be careful of is- these journalists
might have already had an agenda of what

803
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:20,529
they want to do using us and using
anonymous sources as a way

804
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:23,799
to get there, but to answer Jared's
question about how how can we talk to

805
01:02:23,799 --> 01:02:27,400
journalists which is a totally you know
we could have an entire session on how

806
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,880
to talk to the media, but I remember
something as a kid being told no matter

807
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,200
what a journalist asks, you can
always answer with what you want to say.

808
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,799
so they could ask a completely separate
question and it's like if you're pushing

809
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,430
you know futel or whatever it is you can always answer regardless.

810
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:46,118
I believe in this and say it. It
doesn't mean they're gonna take it. If

811
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:49,180
it's on film it's more likely maybe
they'll use it if you keep repeating

812
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:53,529
that or they just won't use you at all.
But if it's if it's in written you just

813
01:02:53,529 --> 01:02:56,170
you just try to do your best to push
again

814
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:58,900
your agenda the way that you're trying
to educate them but just remember that

815
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,210
they can always use that in different
ways and we've had that experience

816
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:04,809
through the L0pht with- MTV really screwed
us one time of, we thought we were

817
01:03:04,809 --> 01:03:07,510
feeding them the right information and
then they took it and pushed their agenda

818
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:10,880
and so sometimes you don't know, but you
just have to be careful of what you say.

819
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,420
[Kim:] Does this panel go to 10:30?Because we're now at 10:30. Ok, we have some more time.

820
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:27,160
Let me take a question over here and then come back to the middle of the room. Is there anyone over here? OK, back to the middle.

821
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:33,899
[Audience:] Why didn't Supermicro come up with a circuit diagram and say this is the chip it's nothing offensive or bad on it?

822
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:41,200
It wouldn't have had their stock price crash so bad. 
[Kim:] But you're assuming the chip exists.

823
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,500
[Joe G.:] Or the location of where where it was or something I don't know I mean let's

824
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,490
assume in do you release your schematics
to prove a point? Depends on how

825
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:51,129
you know, I don't think they're
open-source hardware so they might be a

826
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:54,579
little tentative and in doing that or
maybe it's gonna try to show if they're

827
01:03:54,579 --> 01:03:57,790
defending it that much maybe they appear
guilty or something. 
[Mickey:] Yeah you release

828
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:03,369
your IP it's just you lose money. It's thousands of hours goes into

829
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:06,640
developing these schematics per product line and you don't just go

830
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,339
here you go look at all my secret stuff.
[Joe F.:] And if you-

831
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:16,900
[Audience:] And a follow up would be, would it be possible to buy a Supermicro board off of ebay and see what the heck chip is?

832
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:22,720
[Kim:] I think everyone in the country has been looking at their Supermicro boards so, you don't have to go to ebay to get one.

833
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:30,980
[Jason:] You keep assuming that that chip exists. It's a fictional example.

834
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:38,920
[Joe F.:] It's like the golden ticket on the chocolate bar. 
[ Audience Laughter ]
Except there are no golden tickets.

835
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,440
[Joe G.:] But supposedly there's golden tickets in every single one.

836
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,060
[Joe F.:] Yeah, so let's buy them all.
[Kim:] Let's get another question, yeah.

837
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:56,340
[Dean:] So back to the journalistic integrity kind of stuff. 
[Kim:] I didn't realize that I was going to be on the show.
[ Audience Laughter ]

838
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:04,500
[Dean:] I do kind of feel like there at least is some, like a little bit, of value the lower technical poorly sourced articles because

839
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:12,480
we have had situations where there's anonymous sources saying this stuff and then you have NSA officials dismissing it,

840
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,700
which then inspire people like Mark Klein  to then dump documents, who then inspires Manning, who then inspires Snowden.

841
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:23,020
[Kim:] Sure, yeah so you're talking about something entirely different here. You're talking about,

842
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:27,680
It's often good to have an unofficial anonymous source hang themselves.

843
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:31,078
to actually take a quote from someone,
get it out there in the public so that

844
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:33,809
the real people who know the real
information can come back and counter

845
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:38,250
them we had that with Clapper, right? So
Clapper goes in to testify towards the

846
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:42,960
Congress and says that, and the question
to him is does anyone does the NSA

847
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:48,119
connect to dossiers collect information
on any Americans and he goes on record

848
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:51,059
and says absolutely not and what do we
get in response we get Snowden dumping

849
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:55,109
documents saying oops so we actually are.  So there is value

850
01:05:55,109 --> 01:05:59,369
in journalists reporting anonymous sources that maybe are getting

851
01:05:59,369 --> 01:06:04,079
information wrong or are misrepresenting
it and that does open the way from it

852
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,140
for people who sources who ordinarily
wouldn't go to a journalist they

853
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:09,569
absolutely would never talk to a
journalist and they see something like

854
01:06:09,569 --> 01:06:12,538
that like Snowden never would have gone
to a journalist they see something like

855
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:17,009
that and that's the motivation to set the record straight. Question

856
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:28,000
in the back? Yep. 
[Audience:] I realize a lot of this is speculation so maybe answer as you're able and you may not even be able to speak into it as I think its maybe more of a supply chain question.

857
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:39,280
In speculation, if this chip existed, where in the supply chain would you be able to put that onto the board would it be at any point in the supply chain?

858
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:47,960
I have a little more though. Specifically asking, would you be able to ensure it's delivery to the source that you're targeting, because

859
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:54,520
working with the military, I've never worked with hardware, but I've worked with software. I know that there are several things we have to do to verify

860
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:08,380
before we put something into the wire. It's to control where it's going to go. Because the last thing you want is a chip like this getting into places you don't want and with consumers and sources you don't want to happen.

861
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:17,440
And so, where in the line would they have to be able to identify and guarantee where this is going to do something like that?

862
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:26,440
[Joe G.:] From a hardware perspective talking about the story they

863
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:30,109
say that it that this implant was
seated on to the board meaning that it

864
01:07:30,109 --> 01:07:34,640
was implanted not as an extra add-on
module but as an extra chip or within a

865
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,690
existing chip on the board so that would
have had to be done by the manufacturer

866
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:41,750
which is actually they say was a
subcontractor first Super Micro so one

867
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:46,670
of many contract manufacturers building
stuff. That would have been in the part

868
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:51,349
you know parts acquisition stage and we
know even within the military there's

869
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:55,099
like I think I'm not gonna quote the
number because I can't remember it but

870
01:07:55,099 --> 01:07:59,540
some huge percentage of parts are
counterfeit or bad in some way because

871
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:03,859
the government requirements anyway you
have to buy components that aren't

872
01:08:03,859 --> 01:08:06,619
manufactured anymore so you have to go
through these parts distributors that

873
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:11,720
are harvesting parts from old things. So
you have questionable supply chain

874
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:16,729
even before parts get to the factory. The
article itself had said that that some

875
01:08:16,729 --> 01:08:21,139
Chinese official had pressured somebody
within the factory to implant the part

876
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:25,699
but yeah you could you could get the
parts beforehand, but when they're

877
01:08:25,698 --> 01:08:31,698
implanted on the board I would I mean
the way that I would do this is you know

878
01:08:31,698 --> 01:08:34,519
the engineers who are designing the
system even if there's a hundred of them

879
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,489
working on the motherboard when it's
when it's going through the actual

880
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:41,059
initial pre-production stage sort of
prototyping in pre-production stage

881
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:44,000
people have their eyes on everything
right they're looking at everything

882
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,819
they're testing everything so an implant
at that stage would be detected fairly

883
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:53,660
easily by the engineers or by the test
engineers or manufacturers but once the

884
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:57,500
system goes into production I know
personally and anybody who's designed

885
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,960
hardware can probably attest to this is
once something's in production you don't

886
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,870
you don't really look at it again, right? You maybe do a spot check once

887
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:06,290
in a while to make sure your quality is
still good but the engineers who

888
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:09,560
designed it aren't looking at it anymore.
Then it's just manufacturing. So I would

889
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:14,150
say after pre-production once the system
goes into production is when it when a

890
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:17,479
rev could be made maybe they just call
it an engineering change order of a

891
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:22,639
vendor change and then slap that in and
the and then maybe there's no the test

892
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,000
procedures are not written to look for
it because they're written for the for

893
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,779
the version before that so I think there
is a way to get it in but again it's all

894
01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:33,260
you know why?
[Joe F.:] The article specifically says I think

895
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:37,370
the wording is Supermicro excelled in
the industry because they provide

896
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:40,189
unmatched customization or something like that

897
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:44,089
so basically if you're buying ten
million servers and ten million boards and

898
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:47,630
you tell them exactly what you want and
then they go and they make those 10

899
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:50,330
million boards all at the same time and
like Joe said there'll be some

900
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:53,180
qualification testing and everything but
then when it's time to make 10 million

901
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:54,740
boards they're just knew them all at
once

902
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:58,969
right and that's its assembly you're
already getting a machine to put all

903
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:02,480
these components on the board you know
what's really easy is swapping a reel

904
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:07,969
out right you swap a reel out of 2,000
resistors with 2,000 implants and that's

905
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:11,960
where you do it right and it's swapping
a reel and if it looks the same you're

906
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,200
not gonna pick it up visually if it
functions the same you're not gonna pick

907
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,980
it up. So speculating, this is all
speculation, right, that's where you do it

908
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:22,790
that's how you do it and that's how it
happens and that's how it doesn't get

909
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:27,380
detected. So it's not it's not like
magic that they know that like oh well

910
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:30,680
I'm gonna do this board and roll the
dice and there's an odds that I'll go to

911
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:34,400
the United States and maybe it'll go get
sell to Apple it's like okay there's an

912
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,099
order for 10 million boards or ten
thousand boards I don't know the numbers

913
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:40,610
and it all goes down and all the way at
the factory they know exactly where this

914
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:47,599
this lot is going on the way out. 
[Mike L.:] But this also points to the difficulty in

915
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,520
making something like that. You need
to be able to provide an implant that

916
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:58,070
does not measurably impact the
reliability or the performance of the

917
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:01,849
item and you need to be really sure of
that because that is the way your

918
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:06,260
operation is going to get burned is when
things start going into RMA at unusual

919
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:14,000
rates and that's when people start
investigating. Return, when

920
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,060
the people start returning em they start
investigating why is this happening? The

921
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,940
people who designed the board are the
people who start investigating.

922
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:23,269
[Mickey:] Even if you, let's assume you have a perfect implant and undetectable no RMAs, it's

923
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:28,970
amazing. You still have a target and the
farther back you go in the production to

924
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:33,800
implant your chip, it's a shotgun, right?
The closer you are to the barrel the

925
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,130
more precise you are and the barrel
being the the source of the implant. If

926
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:42,230
you put it in the reel, like Joe suggests,
you're gonna hit everyone who gets the

927
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:47,209
board if you want to be more
you need to involve more humans in the

928
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:52,730
process and exposing more people in an
op gets more risky from getting

929
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:58,190
discovered. 
[Joe G.:] Could this be why the
ANT catalog is showing physical things

930
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:00,710
that you can add on after the device has
been manufactured because you're

931
01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:04,730
targeting one person instead of selling
chip level things that could be

932
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:09,400
implanted during supply chain?
[Mike L.:] Or maybe interdicting packages?
[Joe G.:] Yeah, that's right.

933
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:20,980
[Kim:] Yeah, question, yeah. You.
[Audience:] So I'm listening to this and I know that there's an application issue and security issues with the Internet of Things,

934
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:32,139
and I have looked into that a lot, but all of a sudden people are going to be carrying things around that maybe have wireless access and they may be able to scan things

935
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:43,920
and how does that impact and how do you speak to a public where this is also the situation?

936
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:51,520
[Mickey:] I'm gonna say something before Joe says something. So quickly, all those IOT

937
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:56,350
devices they talk to we're looking into
the future, near future of 5G everyone's

938
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:59,320
gonna have something to talks to
something, but all of those fan out to a

939
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:06,370
server somewhere. So if you want to look
at the threat model for specific devices

940
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:10,330
it's it's more individual person
personal targets more individual

941
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:15,040
specifically, but when we talk about
implants you don't go into this effort

942
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,570
and investing millions of dollars for
something like this. You go into I want

943
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:24,099
everything. I want everyone's data. 
[Joe G.:] But what about for the stuff that MG is

944
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:28,810
working on right? So consumer
level 199 things you can buy on

945
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:34,180
dealextreme that are a cable, or what you
think is a plug that has a GSM you know

946
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:38,020
audio receiver spy thing that's not a
hardware implant like a network style

947
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:41,890
thing but it's the practicality is there
and people anytime you buy something

948
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:45,130
from an untrusted even on Amazon now an
untrusted source because if it's not

949
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:48,820
sold and delivered by Amazon even if it
is you don't know, right? Everything's

950
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:51,549
coming and could be modified and what do
you have picked you have pictures you

951
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:55,390
want to talk about that? 
[Mike G.:] I just wanted to add that on that exact topic there are

952
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:59,680
things for like ten bucks on Amazon GPS
tracking cables and stuff like that hot

953
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:04,630
mics that you can just light up remotely. So
yes, there are malicious individuals that

954
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:09,220
can leverage the type of power that
we're talking about here and that's

955
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:13,060
certainly worth talking about certainly
a very different topic that we could go into.

956
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:18,520
[Mickey:] That's on your attack model 
[Mike G.:] Yeah.
[Kim:] So we only have time for one more question and you've already

957
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:31,040
asked a question so I can't take you
[Audience:] So as we add hardware attacks to our threat model what are the mitigating security controls? Is it software, hardware or some combination of the two?

958
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:35,540
[Kim:] Repeat the question before you answer it.

959
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:40,090
[Joe G.:] No one wants to answer cuz that's a really hard one. So the question was

960
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:44,390
assuming we build in hardware attacks into our threat model,

961
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:50,840
what are mitigating factors we can take.
[Mickey:] It's all about detection I think my

962
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:54,560
opinion is if you if you have if you
have a hardware implant, mitigating it

963
01:14:54,560 --> 01:15:02,300
would be a pain, but detecting a hardware
implant from software will, it's a tough

964
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:07,730
question like Joe said it demands a lot of creativity. Let's call

965
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:12,559
it like that. That's it depends on each
case each Hardware each scenario and

966
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:17,960
what controls does the software have and
how much trust can the software put in

967
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:24,440
those controls. 
[Joe F.:] There's a lot of talk in the software world of people want to

968
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:29,269
build perfect security and we realize
it's not possible. So what we look at is

969
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:33,710
the cost of attacking versus the assets
you're defending and when we talk about

970
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:37,040
things in the hardware world was the
same thing we have you know things that

971
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,820
you can do make sure your keys are on a
chip but then it's not resistant to chip

972
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:45,110
level invasive attacks and side-channel attacks. These things

973
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:48,889
get more expensive very quickly. They go
from things that you can attack one

974
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:52,280
device and break all of them to attack
just one device and you only break that

975
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:56,990
device and it's destructive in the
process. So looking at what mitigations

976
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:59,900
you can put into place whether they're
chip level whether silicon level whether

977
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:04,879
the board level and what the cost of an
attacker is gonna be over time that's

978
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,900
that's really the way to balance it, that I know is possible. 
[Mike L.:] And I think it

979
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:14,240
goes back to like our trust model and
our threat model. You have

980
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:17,960
to have a trust anchor somewhere
and if you know really where that trust

981
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:22,040
anchor is then you can build mitigations.
The problem is that we have where we

982
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:25,070
think the trust anchor is and then all
these other things that we're implicitly

983
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:29,570
trusting that we don't really think that
we're trusting. 
[Kim:] And with that I think

984
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:32,780
we'll have to wrap up thank you all for
coming and join me in thanking the

985
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:35,950
panelists for this great discussion.

986
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:43,380
[Joe F.] Thanks very much Kim for coming all the way up here to join us for this panel.
