thank you everyone for staying here I

2
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,000
know it's been a

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,900
that's a couple of days at least for me

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,120
there's been a lot of really good

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,409
knowledge dropped and also huge things

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,300
to Joe and all the other organizers

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,800
really appreciate them putting in all

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,619
the hard work it takes to to run an

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,060
event like this also appreciate them

10
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:34,420
locking the doors so that none of you

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,760
can leave you're here now it's one way

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,160
out only so I hope you enjoy it

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,150
so as joe said i'm gonna be talking

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,669
about the verizon data breach

15
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,540
investigation report real quick

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,250
disclaimer

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,110
that's a verizon building in New York

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,489
where I live if you know anything about

19
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,260
that building or I'd like to talk about

20
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:52,540
it later I'd be more than happy and

21
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,610
interested to talk with you but I do not

22
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,420
work for Verizon this is not a Verizon

23
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,370
Talk

24
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,470
this isn't even a vendor talk I work for

25
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:03,430
RSA but not today

26
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:07,990
today I'm on vacation I was hoping it

27
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:10,210
would be kind of like this but it's more

28
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,380
like that and so I have lived on the

29
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,779
west coast for a long time I'm quite

30
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,399
used to this nine-month reign season and

31
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,110
so I was very excited to come here to

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,500
see friends not necessarily to see the

33
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,090
city the agenda for today first we're

34
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,189
gonna be talking about what the Verizon

35
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,600
Dade data breach investigation report is

36
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:27,908
as you can tell already

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,788
I often trip over that word so I'll be

38
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,740
calling it the V DB IR the report

39
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:33,850
basically all the facts in the top

40
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,890
portion of the talk that we talked about

41
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,839
are going to be directly from the date

42
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,960
of erisa data breach investigation

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,579
report covering the top trends the hot

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,048
industries that have been mentioned in

45
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:45,609
the report that I'm going to shed a

46
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:48,250
little bit light on defensive techniques

47
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:50,559
and I hope we have discussion this can

48
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,329
be as casual of a talk as you guys would

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,560
like it to be I encourage people to

50
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,029
interrupt if something isn't making

51
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,250
sense if you want to call FUD on

52
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,979
something please do so I also brought

53
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:02,829
some little trinkets in case there isn't

54
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:05,200
much discussion we in InfoSec often have

55
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:07,809
very big opinions behind our keyboards

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,840
but I know myself and very bashful in

57
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:14,590
person and so tried to incentivize you

58
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,180
with some little prizes so what is the

59
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,130
Verizon data breach investigation report

60
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,440
I believe that's the flag of Portland

61
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,670
but someone correct me if I'm wrong it

62
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,010
was kind of difficult to figure that out

63
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,140
yeah I'm getting a head nod so I guess I

64
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,970
did it right so when we talked about the

65
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,540
Verizon data breach investigation report

66
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,689
as joe said this is a yearly report

67
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,040
20:18 they focused on 2017 s data and

68
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,200
this was the 11th year of the report

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,390
when I talk about the report I talk

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,700
about it as a pseudo-random at a threat

71
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,048
intelligence report not only to poke a

72
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,670
little bit of fun at it but I think that

73
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,560
also gives a good overview of war

74
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,750
talking about when we talk about

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,180
pseudo-random talking about where does

76
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:54,239
the data come from in this report there

77
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,430
were 67 individual contributors that fed

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,560
data into the report coming from 65

79
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:02,519
different countries so a pretty broad

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,319
reaching sample of our industry of those

81
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,379
67 investigators they fall into three

82
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,530
main buckets the first one is external

83
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:12,328
investigators or well third-party

84
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,109
investigators to the company being

85
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:15,060
investigated

86
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,220
so Verizon is very clear that these are

87
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,590
not Verizon data breaches they don't

88
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,480
have you know 50,000 did reaches in

89
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,939
Verizon internally every year there's

90
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,200
Verizon Enterprise Services I our team I

91
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,590
have a couple of friends that work there

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,138
previously really solid people really

93
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,209
good services everyone in our industry

94
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,030
has an IR team these days but the data

95
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,590
mostly comes from their investigations

96
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,389
they use the various framework for

97
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,060
reporting I did not know about various

98
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:43,560
previous to this report I haven't really

99
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,019
seen it being used outside of the report

100
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,329
I think it's very strong specifically

101
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,180
various stands for the vocabulary for

102
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,669
event reporting an incident sharing and

103
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,199
I think it's very useful for us as a

104
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:57,449
community to come together and share

105
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,769
what we see going on in the field as the

106
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:01,379
previous speaker talked about we're

107
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:04,470
often very reticent to do that whether

108
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,298
it's for privacy reasons or intellectual

109
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,250
property or you know showing the hand of

110
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,840
your corporation I think we need to get

111
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,120
a little bit beyond that whether it's

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,439
reducing the data and redacting it or

113
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,019
just talking about big trends like they

114
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,690
do here so I talked about that first

115
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,190
bucket Verizon employees paid

116
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,639
investigators that are brought in by

117
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,659
third-party corporations to respond to

118
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,639
threats that they may have their

119
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:29,580
environment to other buckets are

120
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,470
third-party to Verizon themselves so the

121
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,240
first is investigators that are doing

122
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,340
Incident Response using the verus

123
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,539
framework it's very easy for horizon to

124
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,900
feed that into their report

125
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:41,580
third is investigators that Verizon has

126
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,919
had a longtime relationship with that do

127
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,270
not use Varys but Verizon takes their

128
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,099
data

129
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,789
translates it into varus for this report

130
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,700
and thus it's then usable speaking to

131
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,770
the meta portion of this we're not

132
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,900
talking about specific tactics and

133
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,960
techniques in an individual incident

134
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,200
we're talking about broader meta trends

135
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,479
across the entire industry in across

136
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,030
specific industries and incidents within

137
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,010
those industries from the year so there

138
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,840
are fifty thousand incidents around

139
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,760
fifty three thousand incidents that are

140
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,219
included in this year's report and an

141
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,170
incident is defined by Verizon as a

142
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,580
compromising of the CIA triad

143
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,770
so confidentiality integrity

144
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,979
availability I think it's a relatively

145
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,870
well accepted definition of an incident

146
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,700
breach there were 2,000 breaches or so

147
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,980
that were summarized in this report and

148
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,710
a breach as far as I'm concerned is data

149
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,500
walking up the door Verizon has a more

150
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,750
eloquent definition of it about data

151
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,540
getting compromised and ending up in the

152
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,940
hands of unauthorized third parties

153
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,200
stated walking out the door threat

154
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,160
intelligence it's a pretty

155
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,770
straightforward when it comes from the

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,540
report the report is brought to you by

157
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,219
Verizon in the hopes that you can take

158
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,140
some tips and tactics from the report

159
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,880
from a defensive standpoint and apply

160
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,260
that to your own environment so that you

161
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,590
don't have the same types of incidents

162
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,760
cropping up year after year finally why

163
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,080
does the Verizon data breach

164
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,650
investigation report matter

165
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,200
well marketing material it's quoted like

166
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:11,090
everywhere that's kind of a joke but

167
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,860
it's also not because this report is a

168
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,539
very good way to translate some of the

169
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,820
things that we're seeing in the field to

170
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,620
non subject matter experts so I'm sure a

171
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,780
lot of you folks live and breathe

172
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,980
information security much like me but

173
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,719
when you go to the boardroom when you

174
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,670
talk to managers and executives you

175
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,570
can't talk about you know the latest

176
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,450
TTP's

177
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:31,849
you show them the miters attack matrix

178
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,460
which is amazing but does not translate

179
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,890
up above that well something like this

180
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,719
does so you can distill it you can use

181
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,610
you know some of the slides and the data

182
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,560
that i've pulled out as a way to talk to

183
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,140
your management about what you're seeing

184
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,740
in the field and and why that matters to

185
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:52,550
your defense posture legitimately though

186
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,440
it also is an incredibly unique report

187
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,470
in the sense that i think it's one of

188
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,330
the only broad candid

189
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,530
reports of a standardized taxonomy that

190
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,500
we have in our field

191
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,880
mandiant has their m trends varying

192
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,230
quality from year to year it was

193
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,120
incredibly good when mandiant was

194
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,790
mandiant but now mandiant as a fireEye

195
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,890
company I think they've marketized it a

196
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,330
little bit too much out of value I think

197
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,930
it's worth noting that Verizon doesn't

198
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:20,270
really have you know much product in our

199
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:23,300
space they have their services they

200
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:26,419
don't sell us in they don't sell EDR VP

201
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:31,190
so it's a little bit more valuable from

202
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:32,720
that perspective at least to me so let's

203
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,140
talk about some of the top trends from

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,910
the 2018 report these are going to be

205
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,620
social engineering ransomware

206
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,230
we'll talk a little bit of outsider

207
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,080
versus insider threats speak about dwell

208
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,640
time and then cryptocurrency mining

209
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,770
we'll talk about in detail it was

210
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,690
somewhat suspiciously absent from this

211
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:56,120
year's report and I'll talk a little bit

212
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:58,340
why I think so social engineering so as

213
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,460
I'm sure we can all you know agree on

214
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,500
Verizon found that email was the most

215
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,510
likely Avenue for social engineering to

216
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,120
take place but what I found was

217
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,130
particularly interesting was that 4% of

218
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,950
any users will click on any link that's

219
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:16,040
presented with them so even if it's like

220
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:18,289
danger this will do bad things please

221
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:22,250
click on me someone will still click and

222
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:23,930
while 4% seems pretty low if you kind of

223
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,729
standardized that to an organization it

224
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,410
means that all you need is 25 people in

225
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:30,650
an organization for someone to click on

226
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,510
absolutely any link Verizon also found

227
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,760
that repeat offenders are a big thing

228
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,620
once you click on links once your

229
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,468
behavior is that to click on links

230
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,960
you're going to do that more often it's

231
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,810
kind of shown that that happens even in

232
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,520
the face of training and awareness

233
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,290
pretty depressing

234
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,210
speaking of training awareness only 17%

235
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:54,050
of phishing campaigns were found to be

236
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,010
reported inside an organization so say

237
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,780
what you will about training and

238
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,730
awareness I think we can all agree that

239
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,380
when only 17% of people are reporting

240
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,530
phishing campaigns we still need some

241
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,390
more work on that front also kind of

242
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:08,360
ancillary to social engineering using

243
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,610
stolen credentials was the top cause of

244
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,100
data breaches

245
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,839
and so when we work in an industry where

246
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,490
it's much easier to hack humans as

247
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,410
opposed to hacking machines to get

248
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,490
someone's password it's definitely

249
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,870
something that needs to be taken into

250
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:26,010
consideration talking about ransomware

251
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,660
now that is the now-infamous photo of

252
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:31,180
wanna cry if you guys are not familiar

253
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,370
with Rana cry you can talk to any one of

254
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,079
these many organizations and many more

255
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,430
I think Boeing is just up the road a

256
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:37,630
little bit you can go and knock on their

257
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,729
door I'm sure they'd be more than happy

258
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,480
to open their books and talk about what

259
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,880
happened but ransomware topped the list

260
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,610
this year in the number as the number

261
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,250
one malware related attack vector our

262
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,649
attack technique moved up from fourth

263
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,470
place in last year's report and moved up

264
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:59,440
from 22nd place in 2014 so it's

265
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,029
definitely on the rise I think I do

266
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,010
Incident Response and forensics in the

267
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:04,630
field and I've definitely seen it as

268
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,730
pretty much the number one thing that's

269
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,649
been affecting our customers there's

270
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,089
some debate as to whether that's just

271
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,130
because it's so noisy I mean when you

272
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:14,140
have a page like that splashed up on

273
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,730
your screen it's very obvious that

274
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,649
something's going wrong but I think

275
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,279
nonetheless it is a very common attack

276
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:23,079
vector what I think is most important

277
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,760
within the Verizon data set is that they

278
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:27,160
found that ransomware is increasingly

279
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,439
infecting critical business systems as

280
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,199
opposed to just desktops so that

281
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,970
affected a lot of these people here and

282
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:35,920
it's pretty scary because attackers no

283
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,079
longer need to blast out across your

284
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,969
entire organization they can do some

285
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,800
targeted recognizance discover what your

286
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:43,269
crown jewels are and just hit those

287
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,990
because they pretty much know you have

288
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:49,120
to pay in the case of more commodity

289
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,649
ransomware we see a whole new industry

290
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,079
being developed as ransomware as a

291
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:55,029
service so unlike the targeted attacks

292
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:57,279
these attacks are asking for very small

293
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:59,320
amounts of money but due to the

294
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,730
commodification of it it's very easy and

295
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,589
there's a high availability of that in

296
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,420
the field it's kind of like the new tool

297
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:06,399
of script kitties is to go out and just

298
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,800
launch ransomware as the service

299
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,740
campaigns sometimes you'll see these

300
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,479
being advertised as stressors under less

301
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,649
malicious sounding names but they're all

302
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,670
pretty much the same in practice similar

303
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:21,069
to social engineering

304
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,988
over 90% of ransomware was delivered via

305
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:25,429
email

306
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:27,619
email is definitely a very prevalent

307
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:28,929
vector for tax and I think that's

308
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:32,239
something that needs to stay top of mind

309
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:35,419
we'll talk about industry related data

310
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:37,249
shortly email doesn't discriminate

311
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:41,989
against any industry everyone's facing

312
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:44,809
email attacks so let's talk briefly

313
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:46,699
about insider versus outsider attacks as

314
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:49,459
you can see in this graph outsider

315
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:51,829
attacks are up here inside our way down

316
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,599
here so despite all the marketing

317
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:55,160
material all the noise that you hear

318
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,350
when you go to RSA Conference and

319
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,149
blackhat inside our attacks really

320
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,069
aren't that prevalent they're only about

321
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:03,470
a quarter of the attacks and when they

322
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:05,238
are prevalent it's mostly due to error

323
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,529
carelessness well speak about this a

324
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:09,199
little bit more specifically in

325
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:11,089
healthcare but I think we can kind of

326
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:15,639
agree that there's a industry over

327
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:15,639
emphasis on insider attacks question

328
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,608
it's a very good point they can be more

329
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:23,899
destructive a privileged insider can

330
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:28,189
obviously have access to a lot of

331
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:30,139
systems and controls that could do more

332
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:31,879
damage but I'd posit that it's very easy

333
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,699
for an outsider to quickly become an

334
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,619
insider so to speak through such things

335
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:38,358
as credential reuse and social

336
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:40,279
engineering and so at that point it

337
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:42,439
doesn't really matter who the initial

338
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:45,379
person was it's more about what they now

339
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:47,449
have access to but yes very good point

340
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:49,189
and I think that's kind of why we focus

341
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:50,899
a lot on it there's been certainly a lot

342
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:52,969
of media attention kicking off with

343
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:54,409
Edward Snowden no more so with reality

344
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,659
winner there have been a lot of big

345
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:59,059
media since and sensationalistic stories

346
00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:01,970
about the dangers of insiders it's also

347
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:05,478
kind of sexy like that rogue insider as

348
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,859
we'll see very quickly that guy you

349
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:08,749
don't want him wrecking havoc in your

350
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:11,499
environment you just leave that red

351
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:14,629
stapler alone and all will be fine

352
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:16,909
so to your point also while insiders do

353
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:18,559
have definitely privileged access in our

354
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:20,029
environments when we do see insider

355
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,488
attacks the majority of them are being

356
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:24,350
caused by things like error carelessness

357
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:26,479
so it's not necessarily malice that

358
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,209
rogue system administrator isn't

359
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:30,889
something that's really seen that often

360
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:33,498
again healthcare is the only industry

361
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:36,200
that has more threats by insiders and

362
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:42,020
outsiders again though

363
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:44,360
carelessness so external threats we see

364
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:47,329
that over 75% of them were financially

365
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,980
motivated 50% were conducted by

366
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,200
organized crime syndicates I thought

367
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,790
that was pretty interesting it really

368
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,470
just shows the transition from a

369
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:58,430
criminal criminal logical standpoint

370
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:59,900
it's now easier to attack digital

371
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,640
systems than it is physical

372
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,590
there's that popular meme of someone

373
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,880
holding up a bank and saying dude you

374
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,850
could have done a lot more money through

375
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,400
our website so it is interesting to see

376
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:13,220
the trends kind of follow in the digital

377
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,740
space and when it comes to external

378
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,560
attacks despite our focus on them only

379
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,290
13% were due to espionage similarly

380
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,030
around 12% by nation-state attackers so

381
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,390
I think much like insider attacks there

382
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:29,360
is some sort of overemphasis albeit

383
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:32,900
however smaller big on those kind of a

384
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,020
PT's the Bears the pandas all of all of

385
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:38,810
those good things

386
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,189
dwell time as a defender quickly like

387
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:43,369
you know who's who's a defender in this

388
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:46,430
room hunter blue team yeah so this is

389
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:48,830
really embarrassing for us it's found

390
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:52,729
that 87% of compromises took only

391
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:56,600
minutes or seconds even to execute while

392
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:58,550
we found compromises in only three

393
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,980
percent of the time in that same time

394
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,170
frame in minutes or seconds vast

395
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,950
majority of times it's 2/3 of the

396
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,750
breaches take months or longer to find

397
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:12,680
the three-month benchmark is often

398
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:14,180
quoted on my day job I work in a lot of

399
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,849
customer Sims and packet captures

400
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,349
technologies and it's kind of

401
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,540
interesting that most people have a

402
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,670
retention for three months so when you

403
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,449
find that breach in your environment you

404
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,250
find a compromise

405
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,230
you only have three months of data to

406
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,210
look back on so it's not to say that the

407
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,920
breach or the actors have only been in

408
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,560
your environment for three months it's

409
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,689
just that's all you can see so I'd posit

410
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,189
that attackers are actually in our

411
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,590
environments much longer doing

412
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:43,340
recognizance getting kind of a lei for

413
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,990
the land and then living off of it it's

414
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,570
also pretty embarrassing is that in many

415
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,520
different incidents and breaches across

416
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,760
all different types of industries it's

417
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,650
not

418
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,630
the organization itself that discovers

419
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,569
the breach it's often a third party a

420
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:59,600
partner law enforcement organization

421
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,890
sometimes even your customers I think we

422
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,960
can all agree that it's not an ideal

423
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,210
scenario by the time that the FBI is

424
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,580
knocking at your door it's often far far

425
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:11,800
too late to prevent any sort of critical

426
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:14,390
business damage so cryptocurrency mining

427
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,069
cryptocurrency mining is again

428
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,780
suspiciously absent in this year's

429
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,930
Verizon data breach investigation report

430
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:23,390
until you get around 90% through the

431
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,859
report appendix D is in fact the first

432
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,030
time the cryptocurrency mining attacks

433
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,400
are even mentioned

434
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:31,370
appendix D is Verizon's year-in-review

435
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,930
so it takes all the months in 2017 kind

436
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,480
of gives a brief summary of the

437
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,010
different incidents that affected

438
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,470
companies in those months it's mentioned

439
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:41,450
an 8 out of 12 of the months in 2017 so

440
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,720
it's clear that Verizon knows that this

441
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,520
is going on seemingly something was kind

442
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,320
of misty ER in their report but I do

443
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,840
have one possible explanation I'd love

444
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,390
to hear your folks is is guesses as well

445
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:56,450
my guess is that cryptocurrency mining

446
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,880
attacks rose socks then had to respond

447
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,160
to them finally the industry analysts

448
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,740
such as Verizon needed to funnel them up

449
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,300
into the report so my guess is that next

450
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,040
year's report we're going to see this as

451
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,829
one of the top trends likely right

452
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,389
behind right behind ransomware but that

453
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:21,109
it just takes a little bit of lead time

454
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:22,880
for it to make it into the report that's

455
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:24,260
absolutely true but it should have

456
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,600
showed up in the incidents because it's

457
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,770
absolutely a violation of the CIA triad

458
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,070
whether you're talking about

459
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:33,379
availability or integrity that that is a

460
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,850
very good point that I think sometimes

461
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,240
we overemphasize cryptocurrency mining

462
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:40,490
as a breach type of incident it's often

463
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,920
at you know Adele's SERP that our

464
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,820
corporate overlords it is considered a

465
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:49,490
declared incident but it's not in the

466
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,990
report at all and so even as one of the

467
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,810
top trends I would have expected it to

468
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,310
be they're looking outside of the report

469
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,560
I think it's only logical that these

470
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:59,350
attacks take place and that they may in

471
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,330
fact be on the rise or at least were

472
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,658
it's very easy to conduct them in the

473
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,408
sense

474
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:08,059
that there's a low barrier for entry you

475
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:09,799
also get immediate access to the funds

476
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:11,359
as an attacker and they're relatively

477
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:13,729
non-destructive if you're doing them

478
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:16,070
correctly so if you have a large set of

479
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:17,599
users you can do a very slow roll of

480
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,820
cryptocurrency mining very low

481
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,869
processing can even do them on IOT

482
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,129
devices security cameras routers and

483
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:26,899
monetize that very quickly and not need

484
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:30,678
to wait for someone to pay a ransom in

485
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:32,359
order for you to get results from it it

486
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,729
will also be interesting to see as the

487
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,769
crypto currency markets declined in

488
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:38,749
value themself if that's going to have a

489
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:41,179
corollary dis crease in cryptocurrency

490
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:42,799
mining attacks I think we can all agree

491
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:45,379
that the cryptocurrency mining markets

492
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,759
were insane for a while now they come

493
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:49,248
back to earth a little bit and so I'll

494
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:51,619
be interesting to see if the incidence

495
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:52,999
of these mining attacks decreases well I

496
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:55,220
have not seen that in the field

497
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:59,899
currently they steel still seem to be

498
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:02,539
pretty pretty common but we'll see if

499
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:05,359
the monetization factor forces the hand

500
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:07,399
of them to decrease another potential

501
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,199
topic for discussion is I've had a lot

502
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:11,149
of chocolate co-workers about whether

503
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,220
the ransomware attackers have pivoted to

504
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:14,599
cryptocurrency mining or if it's a new

505
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,149
breed of attackers that's coming out

506
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,189
some debate about amongst that but I'd

507
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:21,168
love to hear anyone have any opinions on

508
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,489
that anyone see any decrease and

509
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:26,749
ransomware in your field as

510
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:31,039
cryptocurrency mining has increased you

511
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:33,499
can get back to that later so now the

512
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,570
hot industries I was very surprised to

513
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:39,379
see that Portland headache port I'm not

514
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:42,080
sure quite how that's possible but it

515
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:44,090
does and that's it it doesn't look

516
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,460
completely that robust but I'm impressed

517
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:51,139
for a landlocked City you guys have a

518
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,609
port so health care is one of the

519
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:54,228
biggest industries in terms of the

520
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:56,899
Verizon data breach investigation report

521
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:59,149
they pay a lot of stock and time in

522
00:19:56,899 --> 00:20:00,678
talking about health care I think mostly

523
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:02,599
because that's where the most valuable

524
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,729
data is these days if you take a look at

525
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:05,989
the darknet credit card financial data

526
00:20:04,729 --> 00:20:07,700
yeah that's kind of like a couple

527
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:09,859
sentence these days but medical records

528
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,889
are at least twenty dollars so there's

529
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:14,908
there's that and healthcare again the

530
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:17,849
only industry were insider attacks out

531
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:19,559
a threats from the outside but as I

532
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,629
mentioned previously the vast majority

533
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,609
of that is due to error carelessness I

534
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:25,678
think we can agree that when we go to

535
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:27,539
the doctor whether it's doctors or

536
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,669
nurses there are a million different

537
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:32,309
systems that they're all using whether

538
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:34,859
it's epic or homebrew home-brewed

539
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,899
systems I see my doctor going into like

540
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,590
eight different terminals having no idea

541
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:39,869
what he's doing

542
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,609
pretty much every time I go there so I

543
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:43,499
think it's only natural that some error

544
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:45,928
is introduced just through the human

545
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:47,669
element these are also not necessarily

546
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:50,099
the most technical savvy folks nor

547
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:51,690
should they necessarily need to be so I

548
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,700
wish we could do something more in that

549
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,919
realm to make it easier to secure our

550
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,479
health records which is at least as far

551
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,409
as I'm concerned is pretty much the most

552
00:20:57,479 --> 00:21:04,710
important data about me the health care

553
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:06,509
vertical when DC incidents there are

554
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,759
seven times as likely due to error

555
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:12,059
carelessness so it's a pretty big deal

556
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:14,249
for the for this folks up to employee

557
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:17,070
abuse of access is the only real

558
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:20,789
malicious insider threat that they see

559
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:23,928
in health care although in about 50% of

560
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:27,179
the time that's due to fun or curiosity

561
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,769
so this is something like if you have if

562
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:31,169
you know a celebrity has recently stayed

563
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:32,700
in one of your hospitals you can go and

564
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:34,529
look at their medical records not

565
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,639
necessarily to sell it to TMZ and

566
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:39,929
monetize it just purely out of curiosity

567
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:41,908
when it comes to external threats

568
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:43,950
ransomware is a huge problem in health

569
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:46,049
care there have been popular media

570
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,460
reports of lots of health care

571
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:50,009
institutions getting hit by ransomware

572
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,889
it's not just the big ones they'll

573
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:54,570
pretty much go after anyone though

574
00:21:52,889 --> 00:21:57,748
speaking of the big ones Merck was a

575
00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:00,450
huge victim from the not petia campaign

576
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,859
well not necessarily ransomware I think

577
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,899
one could argue that not petia is a

578
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:06,299
great example of human error in terms of

579
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:09,840
the execution of that campaign so

580
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:13,049
there's there's that public

581
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,689
administration I kind of poo pooed whole

582
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:18,359
apt nation-state espionage vector

583
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,609
earlier this is where it matters around

584
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,908
50% of the attacks in public

585
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:27,119
administration were due to nation-state

586
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:28,760
advanced sophisticated attacks that's an

587
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:32,330
incredibly anomalous to

588
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:35,150
stick in the report only 13% of the rest

589
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,710
of attacks incidents and breaches in the

590
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,680
report were due to nation-state

591
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:41,570
attackers it's not just state secrets

592
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,270
though it's also the data of civilians

593
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:47,870
and employees in these public

594
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:50,750
administration breaches of citizen and

595
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,969
personal data were double fold compared

596
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,220
to the theft of state secrets I thought

597
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,690
that was pretty interesting because it's

598
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,510
not just kind of the intellectual

599
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:02,270
property of the f-35 that people are

600
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:04,430
coming after it's as the depart or the

601
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:06,320
state of Georgia can attest to pretty

602
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,630
much everything that they have and much

603
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,070
of what they have is data about us so I

604
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,740
think it's in all of our interest to

605
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,810
help defend public administration not

606
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,400
necessarily the whole military complex

607
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,889
but at least the local and state

608
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,310
governments that really are necessary

609
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,630
for day to day life to function it's not

610
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,190
mentioned in a report but I think

611
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,200
critical infrastructure is also going to

612
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:30,260
start coming into play whether its

613
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,820
traditional critical infrastructure like

614
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,550
industrial control systems water

615
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,320
treatment facilities or new age types of

616
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,960
technologies like connected cities

617
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,429
connected cars public administration is

618
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,590
behind all of this for better or worse

619
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:45,970
and so we need to ensure that those

620
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,970
vectors are defended against as well

621
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,350
information technology I know probably a

622
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,930
many of you and from in the room or from

623
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:56,870
this field we have Amazon and Microsoft

624
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:58,850
up north we have Silicon Valley below us

625
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:03,709
Intel is either to the east or the west

626
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:06,110
I'm not entirely sure but distributed

627
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:09,320
denial-of-service Rd doses are rampant

628
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:11,139
in IT it's over 50% of the attacks that

629
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,120
we see are DDoS campaigns an

630
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,380
amplification attacks whether it's DNS

631
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,199
reflection or other types of the

632
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,960
amplification attacks are incredibly

633
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,360
prevalent over 75% of the DDoS campaigns

634
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,710
used amplification which is pretty scary

635
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,780
when you think when you have things like

636
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:30,680
mirai out there that make it very easy

637
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,850
to kind of amplify any sort of normal

638
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,350
DDoS attack you don't need the

639
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,649
traditional infrastructure that you once

640
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:39,080
did in order to conduct these attacks an

641
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:41,210
average attacks produced around 600

642
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,679
megabyte megabits per second of traffic

643
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,210
that kind of surprised

644
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,700
because we're used to hearing the

645
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,950
gigabit per second or terabit per second

646
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,990
tax that hit people like Brian Krebs and

647
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:53,630
din I know that I freaked out when

648
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,400
Twitter went down so that was not cool

649
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:57,820
but even earlier this year github saw

650
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,530
the attack of 1.3 terabits per second

651
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:03,350
shortly thereafter Arbor Networks got

652
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,910
hit by 1.7 terabit per second attack so

653
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,679
they're definitely ramping up and it'll

654
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:09,890
be interesting to see how those trends

655
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,810
continue to rise only saving grace here

656
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,760
is that the attacks usually lasts only a

657
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,639
matter of minutes or seconds but for a

658
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,350
lot of these companies you know if your

659
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,090
web presence has taken down for a couple

660
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,689
of minutes that's millions of dollars

661
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:25,129
that's out the door the most common

662
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,870
attack vector here is probably not

663
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,690
surprising to a lot of us its servers

664
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:32,409
over 90% of the attacks in DDoS

665
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,580
campaigns were targeting servers mostly

666
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,590
database servers and web application

667
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,090
servers not only are these where the

668
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,639
crown jewels are in terms of

669
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:43,399
availability necessities but they're

670
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,410
also very rarely well secured that's for

671
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,900
a number of reasons the talk previous

672
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,120
went into a depth about you know dev net

673
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,640
sack ops the new kind of hybrid term of

674
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,310
overarching you know security and

675
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,750
development unicorn life I think we're

676
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:59,060
spreading our talents a bit too thin

677
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,770
these days and so we need to take you

678
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,820
know a bit more considerate approach in

679
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,530
securing these types of assets

680
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,649
especially when they're so core to our

681
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:08,810
business one good thing is there was a

682
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:12,230
significant decline in breaches in IT in

683
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:15,649
2016 and 2017 so we're not doing a

684
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:17,630
horrible job at least an industry that's

685
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,820
doing a pretty good job is the financial

686
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,770
industry they're the only industry to

687
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,169
have significant declines and decreases

688
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,629
for incidents and breaches pretty much

689
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:29,660
for the past five years the past three

690
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,100
years have a steep steep decline I'm

691
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,050
relatively proud of that I work with a

692
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,899
lot of financial folks out in New York

693
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:38,389
they spend lots of money though and so

694
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:41,060
it's somewhat difficult kind of model to

695
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:43,180
follow because not everyone has the

696
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,470
dispensable income that a bank does

697
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,050
these days the current threats are

698
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:51,440
mainly physical so whether it's ATM

699
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:53,270
skimming card skimming or ATM jackpot

700
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,190
engg I mean we've known about these for

701
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,210
a long time this is from Barnaby Jack's

702
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,450
presentation

703
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:02,270
blackhat 2010 so been out there for a

704
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:04,190
while we have an ATM next door I think

705
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:07,730
it's hilarious at how easy it is to pop

706
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,110
it even just with pics and so there

707
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,550
definitely needs to still be a lot of

708
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,550
work done from a physical perspective

709
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:17,390
education education is a funny one when

710
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,030
it comes to the Verizon data breach

711
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:22,040
investigation report over ten percent of

712
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,680
the attacks had fun as their primary

713
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,500
motive I just think that's great

714
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,850
I know when I was a student I was doing

715
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,890
things I probably shouldn't have not

716
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,330
from a malicious standpoint at all just

717
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,070
because you go to class you hear some

718
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,350
new techniques you go on the forums at

719
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:39,020
night and you need somewhere to test

720
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:41,719
your new skills that's usually your

721
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,520
campuses network so I just want to give

722
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:48,380
a quick shout out to anyone in academia

723
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:51,350
here keep up the good fight also in

724
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,850
education you'll see things like this

725
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,159
Verizon I think does a very good job

726
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:57,760
with their graphics but every once in a

727
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:00,740
while you'll get something like this and

728
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,900
I would love to hear if anyone in the

729
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,080
audience can form any sort of you know

730
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,760
logical trend from this graph the only

731
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,230
trend that I can see and I think it's

732
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,520
actually a valuable thing to note is

733
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,950
that you can't make trends around

734
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,590
everything not everything can have a

735
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,870
baseline an average an anomalous vector

736
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:19,310
you need to kind of take a considered

737
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,899
approach and look at your own

738
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:24,230
environment whether it's your industry

739
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,720
or your specific enterprise and defend

740
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:29,480
accordingly if you're in education and

741
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,830
you're only focusing on crime where 2014

742
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,840
you would have killed it it would've

743
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:36,470
been like 90 percent success rate but

744
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,060
these days you're well below 10% and so

745
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,310
you really need to take a look at what's

746
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:42,940
hitting your specific organization and

747
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:45,620
defend accordingly

748
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,800
that brings us to defensive techniques

749
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,389
I was interested if anyone would boo the

750
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:55,190
Portland Police image but you guys seem

751
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:58,040
to be pretty good corporate citizens so

752
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,480
visibility I think visibility is a huge

753
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,659
deal these times these days and

754
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,010
enterprises in my opinion it's pretty

755
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,710
much the greatest improvement you can

756
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:08,750
make for a pretty low dollar amount I

757
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,680
work for RSA now witness we sell a

758
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,390
visibility project

759
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:15,050
our product it is incredibly expensive

760
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:17,600
but you do not need us you can use snort

761
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:20,200
Zeke I think it's now called which is

762
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,820
that's we're bros Zeke that's odd for me

763
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,680
sir cata there the security onion is an

764
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,659
amazing tool and so if you don't have

765
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,340
the budget to buy a fancy commercial

766
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,470
tool there are tons of things out there

767
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,820
on the market to do that when I talk

768
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:35,270
about visibility I think it's very

769
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,139
important to focus on the fact that you

770
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,120
know many people are saying

771
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,980
defense-in-depth is dead I don't think

772
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,260
it's dead necessarily but I think it's a

773
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,730
starter it's a beginning step you need

774
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,920
your defense in depth defense and depth

775
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,300
is going to protect against a lot of the

776
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,250
low hanging fruit attacks a lot of the

777
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,470
commodity type of attacks but you also

778
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,940
need more than that you need visibility

779
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,500
into not only your logs but your

780
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:58,370
endpoint in your network environment as

781
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:00,260
well peak apps are great you know peak

782
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:02,840
apps are didn't happen type of thing you

783
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,250
really need to have visibility and cross

784
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,679
your environment to understand the full

785
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:11,720
attack campaign of or the full scope of

786
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:13,670
an attack campaign this is also an

787
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,140
incredibly important graph from the

788
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,580
Verizon data breach investigation report

789
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,350
I know it's probably very difficult to

790
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,520
see right now it's available not only in

791
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,169
the full report but also in the

792
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,270
executive summary and I've kind of

793
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,710
zoomed in on the four different areas

794
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,420
that I've talked about today the four

795
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,890
different verticals I think it's

796
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,750
incredibly important that you tailor

797
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:32,180
your defenses to your environment I

798
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,640
spoke about this previously but I'll go

799
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:37,070
into a little bit more detail first I'd

800
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,650
focus on your industry so here you can

801
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:41,090
see there are some pretty you know big

802
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,520
trends that you can determine if you're

803
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,060
an education crime work isn't a big deal

804
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,740
for you

805
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,870
Janell lip service is because your

806
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:51,170
students and faculty need to access your

807
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:53,870
assets on pretty much a daily basis and

808
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,790
so you need to take the kind of self

809
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,620
inventory and ensure that you have the

810
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,270
necessary security controls in place to

811
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,860
defend against the trends that you guys

812
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:03,350
are seeing the most in whatever industry

813
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,060
you work in you then need to take that

814
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:07,760
down to a granular level and take a look

815
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,710
at your own enterprise this requires a

816
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,510
look at the people process technologies

817
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:14,480
that you have available and implemented

818
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:16,070
and so you know it sounds silly but I've

819
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,290
seen a lot of folks try to implement a

820
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:20,990
hunt team with like a single junior

821
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:22,850
level one analyst it's probably not

822
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:25,590
where your efforts are best spent

823
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:27,510
likewise you probably shouldn't know are

824
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,889
you sure probably be hunting for apt in

825
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,560
your environment if you don't even know

826
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,700
what devices are on your network you

827
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,310
also shouldn't be instituting and

828
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,200
purchasing AI machine learning you know

829
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,240
whatever deep dreaming technologies that

830
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,450
are being sold these days without having

831
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,040
a competence in there's a lot of forces

832
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,330
out there from marketing from the

833
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,310
different conferences for your

834
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,990
executives will come back and say you

835
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:52,169
know here's a couple hundred thousand

836
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:54,360
dollars get this AI technology get this

837
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:56,130
automation technology and will save all

838
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,189
of your problems and you really need to

839
00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:01,290
have data points such as this report to

840
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,340
really push back on that and say you

841
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,200
know these are the threats that we're

842
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,699
facing in our environment these are the

843
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,530
tools that I think can help defend

844
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:12,120
against them let's go that way instead a

845
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,410
big thing that I'm a I'm a huge

846
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,989
proponent of for a lot of the customers

847
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:17,670
that I work with is creating a data

848
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:20,040
breach investigation report for your own

849
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:22,800
environment it by known means needs to

850
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,820
be public and as robust as Verizon's but

851
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,340
I think there are two main things that

852
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,689
can accomplish first is that you can get

853
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,949
an amazing baseline from your

854
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,780
environment you take that report

855
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:33,600
year-on-year compared to previous years

856
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:37,110
and see exactly what's trending in your

857
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,790
own ecosystem additionally it's a great

858
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,100
way to get visibility at the executive

859
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,139
level without getting dragged up to the

860
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,540
you know top floor conference room when

861
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,400
something bad is going on I know I've

862
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,409
had a lot of sock experience in my past

863
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,270
and it's very often that you only talk

864
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:54,240
to those important people at the company

865
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:56,220
when you're kind of under attack and and

866
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,230
they're looking to you as like you guys

867
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,780
have failed why didn't you do your job

868
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,820
doing a report like this a yearly report

869
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,470
and briefing your executives on it get

870
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,840
to immense visibility kind of a seat at

871
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:11,790
that table without anything to be pushed

872
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:14,370
on you another big thing is Hardware

873
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:16,110
tokens Hardware tokens I think are an

874
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,760
incredible step that you can make to

875
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:20,159
defend against phishing and other

876
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,750
credential reuse type of attacks here I

877
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,240
had to kind of give an homage the old

878
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:26,460
secure ID tokens of the day but we're

879
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,390
really talking about these days is gee

880
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,310
wikis Google had an amazing case study

881
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:35,070
it was released by Brian Krebs on his

882
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:36,090
blog since they rolled out Hardware

883
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,070
tokens in place

884
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,340
of one-time passwords and other types of

885
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:43,049
authentication methods in early 2017

886
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:45,689
they haven't had a single incidence of

887
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:48,360
phishing amongst their 85,000 plus

888
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:50,940
employees that was really impressive to

889
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:53,668
me I had been using you know Google

890
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,100
Authenticator try not to do SMS whenever

891
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:57,990
I can but I completely switched over to

892
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,480
Yubikey after that with a pretty low

893
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:02,159
growth or a learning curve it's pretty

894
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,289
easy to use these these days they're

895
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,750
relatively cheap they have mobile models

896
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:09,000
desktop models there's really no excuse

897
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:13,980
to have an environment without some sort

898
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,290
of hardware based authentication finally

899
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,760
you really need to focus on the basic

900
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,918
building blocks before you do anything

901
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,679
else you don't need to build that kind

902
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:25,589
of Starship Enterprise Trooper without

903
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,300
focusing on you know the 101's when I

904
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:29,699
talk about the one-on-ones first you can

905
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,399
even start about sysadmin patching and

906
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:34,020
backups backups pretty straightforward I

907
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,540
haven't heard of an organization giving

908
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,460
much pushback on backups mutually it's

909
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,679
just determining the amount of time and

910
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,589
the method that you use patching is a

911
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,820
bit more difficult there are some

912
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:47,730
systems that unfortunately you just

913
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,500
can't patch I know that's a reality so

914
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:51,810
patch for you can and where you can't

915
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,580
segment those systems increase the

916
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:55,379
monitoring on them so that you have as

917
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,960
much visibility as possible to determine

918
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:59,759
if something is going wrong after you

919
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,910
kind of hit off the sysadmin 101

920
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,109
checklist move to the CISSP I know we

921
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,299
all joke about it but there's some

922
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:09,859
valuable information in there whether

923
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:12,740
it's you know keeping need-to-know

924
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:14,910
privileges privileges of least access

925
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,879
you really need to know who in your

926
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:20,069
environment has access to what determine

927
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,440
what the criticality is of those assets

928
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:25,619
and ensure you're doing roving audits of

929
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,240
that Netflix has an amazing program the

930
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:29,450
name escapes me right now but I believe

931
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,399
it's open source where they have a

932
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:35,669
protocol that will kind of do random

933
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,810
reduction of privileges chaos monkey

934
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:40,980
thank you so if someone complains they

935
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,869
say hey I need that it's part of my

936
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,250
daily job you can either automatically

937
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:46,140
reenroll it or you can do a manual

938
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,599
review and ensure that they actually do

939
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,569
need it if no one complains probably

940
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,700
shouldn't have a dad

941
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:53,170
had access to that in first place so I

942
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,080
think systems like that incredibly

943
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:57,700
useful relatively low friction I know

944
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,250
you're Deb's are always fighting against

945
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:03,730
you to have you know pseudo rude and

946
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:05,410
more and and so things like that can be

947
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:11,380
easily implemented in your environment

948
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:13,509
so that is all I had I did not want to

949
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:16,090
spend the 50 minutes kind of distilling

950
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:18,340
every single statistic in the Verizon

951
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,720
data breach investigation report I'll

952
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,220
take some questions now if there are any

953
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,529
and then we can move to a discussion I

954
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,270
do not want to take these pins home so

955
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:30,300
you guys need to participate and get

956
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:30,300
some some goodies any questions first I

957
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:38,980
expected that and I have some topics for

958
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:40,360
you so do the trends that you saw here

959
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,820
match what you guys see in your

960
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:45,220
environments why do you think we as an

961
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:47,280
industry may overemphasize such things

962
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,870
like insider tax nation-state attacks

963
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,420
how can we come more tailored and less

964
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,980
effective in our defenses and what you

965
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,240
guys use what defensive techniques do

966
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,880
you use that you'd like to share with

967
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,220
others I'm a huge advocate of sharing in

968
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,260
our community I think it's great and so

969
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:05,430
you know this is a forum now for you

970
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,430
guys to do so yes

971
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:22,670
yep yep so the comment was focused on

972
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:24,380
end-user training what in your

973
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,180
organization do you guys use have you

974
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,920
seen effective and I know I personally

975
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,980
cringe when I hear about it and user

976
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,769
training but a sneaker yesterday talked

977
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:34,940
about having an escape room method for

978
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:36,979
their user training that seemed to be

979
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,680
incredibly effective it sounded cool to

980
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,480
me I'd like escape rooms if I had to you

981
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,749
do that as part of any user training I'd

982
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,339
be pretty stoked any think anything that

983
00:37:44,749 --> 00:37:54,049
you guys have done in your organization

984
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:55,940
that you have not yeah that's the

985
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:57,259
unfortunate truth of it I agree that

986
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,170
that we need to get a little bit more

987
00:37:57,259 --> 00:38:01,339
agile with our user training and more

988
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:06,739
applicable to the threats that are

989
00:38:01,339 --> 00:38:13,630
facing on a daily basis nice little

990
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:13,630
Trevor forget pin anything else anyone

991
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:40,860
yeah no I appreciate that I did have

992
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:43,649
only one of the customers that I work

993
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,970
with kind of take me up on that and last

994
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,410
year they were able to get two

995
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:48,509
additional head counts as a result of

996
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:52,410
that and this year they were able to get

997
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:56,040
a vast increase in budget so it is you

998
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:57,240
know valuable it's not just it's very

999
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,980
little work as well a lot of times

1000
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,390
you'll have these metrics just kind of

1001
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,770
sitting in your different products it's

1002
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:03,960
just a matter of pulling them making

1003
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:06,390
them pretty dumbing them down perhaps

1004
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:11,300
for executives and and then kind of

1005
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:11,299
getting that seat at the table yes I

1006
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:26,400
would venture to say many but yeah if if

1007
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:28,320
Verizon didn't know that it existed

1008
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,090
there's no way to put a metric behind

1009
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,270
that so I think it's it's really hard to

1010
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,270
say

1011
00:39:41,850 --> 00:40:03,509
I would make sure that they're not able

1012
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,950
to keep it out of the media less they

1013
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:07,950
are one of the most highly regulated

1014
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:09,480
industries I know personally New York

1015
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,970
State just put a new regulation that's

1016
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,730
very kind of gdpr esque in terms of

1017
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:16,500
mandating disclosures of breaches my

1018
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:18,540
guess is that they have been so

1019
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,220
fortified for so long now that they're

1020
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,900
just not the target that attackers are

1021
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,580
going to take there will always be the

1022
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,860
concerted attackers that hit the Swift

1023
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,690
system you know you still hear about

1024
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,480
these things happening but in terms of a

1025
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:44,760
single institution getting breached it's

1026
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:47,840
far and few in between yes aardvark is

1027
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,840
the one that I was thinking about yeah

1028
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:08,870
yeah that is not in the scope of this

1029
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:13,189
report as far as I know but it is a

1030
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:15,859
personal question of mine those numbers

1031
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:18,530
and metrics are incredibly far ranging

1032
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:20,300
it's as low as you know two hundred

1033
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:22,280
thousand dollars for someone like target

1034
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,260
and in my mind I'm like well it that's

1035
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,540
pretty cheap compared to a security tool

1036
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,920
so I hope we don't take the trend of

1037
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,320
just considering these things as like

1038
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,210
shrinkage and shoplifting where it's

1039
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,190
cheaper to get breached than it is to

1040
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,680
you know put the security tools in place

1041
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,630
to detect them but you also hear

1042
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,600
estimates going all the way up to like

1043
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,460
two hundred million dollars adventure

1044
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,690
it's somewhere in between but a lot of

1045
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,640
the more destructive campaigns that

1046
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:49,390
we've seen and the wanna cry and the not

1047
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,310
petty --is of recent there was

1048
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:54,200
definitely significant in major

1049
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,330
disruptions to business

1050
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,069
that must have exceeded even the 200

1051
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,049
million dollar mark just from from

1052
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,400
personal knowledge of those attacks some

1053
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,410
of those those companies were very

1054
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,140
heavily affected

1055
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:17,990
I know Maersk is still you know cleaning

1056
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:20,950
up from that yep yeah it's probably not

1057
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:25,189
good to use a bug bounty as a facade of

1058
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:28,490
paying extortion to a attacker I think

1059
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,820
that was the the BER scenario definitely

1060
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:33,259
not a good look especially when uber has

1061
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:35,600
so much other things going on you think

1062
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,130
they'd behave well when you know

1063
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:41,290
something they're outed an instance like

1064
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,290
that yes

1065
00:42:49,989 --> 00:42:55,849
yeah that that reason is specifically

1066
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,859
why I solely kind of used Verizon I do

1067
00:42:55,849 --> 00:43:00,169
check it especially in preparation for

1068
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:02,179
this talk the trends that they report on

1069
00:43:00,169 --> 00:43:04,729
pretty much match the other ones in

1070
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:07,910
other reports mandiant SEM Trends was a

1071
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:10,629
huge huge thing for me a while back it's

1072
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:12,859
become a little diluted in my my opinion

1073
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,719
but I would love you know other

1074
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:19,339
suggestions if people use other metrics

1075
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:23,689
and other reports Gartner is Gartner and

1076
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:25,489
so not gonna say much more about that

1077
00:43:23,689 --> 00:43:29,149
but there there definitely are a lot of

1078
00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:31,369
reports out there but I think of the

1079
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:35,169
Verizon data breach investigation report

1080
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:35,169
is being kind of the creme de la creme

1081
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:02,630
so that that is something that's been

1082
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:03,710
seen and people try and draw corollaries

1083
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:06,410
between that and the increase in

1084
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:09,530
cryptocurrency mining I'm not confident

1085
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:12,109
that that's an accurate correlation to

1086
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:16,130
make but I think we need a little bit

1087
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:19,220
more time on that ransomware is still

1088
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:22,850
certainly very prevalent and the

1089
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:25,970
reduction in those quarterly time spaces

1090
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:28,759
also curiously matched general reduction

1091
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:31,850
in attacks I'm not quite sure what

1092
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,530
that's about whether people kind of get

1093
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:37,460
lazy at the end of the year they go on

1094
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:39,230
holiday they've reaped all of the you

1095
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,150
know Bitcoin that they need for for the

1096
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:44,660
year and they're good and then they kind

1097
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:46,280
of wake back up in q2 but that is

1098
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,350
definitely a trend throughout all

1099
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,920
industries that see that type of

1100
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:51,529
behavior

1101
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,150
the only kind of out lies are outliers

1102
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:55,790
are that are the commercial industries

1103
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:58,990
to get hit very heavily during you know

1104
00:44:55,790 --> 00:45:01,250
the holiday seasons but most other folks

1105
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:02,810
it's odd because if I plug in an

1106
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,910
attacker hat on I think that most of the

1107
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:06,529
defenders are going on vacation so what

1108
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:09,350
better time to hit them then at the end

1109
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:11,330
of the year but I think there are also a

1110
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:13,430
lot of freezes put into effect where

1111
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:17,120
systems are taking off for maintenance

1112
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:18,710
or whatnot that make it a little bit

1113
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:23,330
more difficult for attackers to execute

1114
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:25,720
on their objectives any other questions

1115
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,720
or comments

1116
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:49,600
it's a very good question Aiki has had

1117
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:53,260
success over the past two years

1118
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:56,920
I think I'm particularly cynical I think

1119
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:59,470
many of us are and so I'd look to the

1120
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,390
internal threat actors and the non

1121
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:03,819
malicious attacks that they take that

1122
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:06,700
they follow as kind of a success of

1123
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:10,000
humanity so to speak in that even when

1124
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,290
people are behind these attacks and have

1125
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,150
very privileged positions in our

1126
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:15,190
environment they're generally not doing

1127
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:18,520
it out of malice it's more human nature

1128
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:22,869
of curiosity the folks in education just

1129
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:25,119
doing it for the lulz it's it's I agree

1130
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:26,470
that we have very pessimistic views of

1131
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,230
kind of the state of our industry

1132
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:32,500
oftentimes this report does not do a

1133
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:34,960
great job of reversing that but I think

1134
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,270
there there are small wins that you can

1135
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,580
take in each of the industries in terms

1136
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:44,009
of the reduction of attack surface and

1137
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:44,009
corollary result of incidents

1138
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:19,640
yeah that that very well be could that

1139
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:21,710
very well could be the case it's not

1140
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,690
necessarily reflected in a report but I

1141
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,190
do believe that it's obviously easier to

1142
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:27,740
patch a desktop machine in most cases

1143
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:29,660
than it is a critical server especially

1144
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:31,759
one Runnings let's say some sort of

1145
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:33,440
operational technology that literally

1146
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:41,059
cannot work if that patch were put into

1147
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:44,359
place exactly that is well though from

1148
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:47,150
that perspective if your servers are

1149
00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:49,460
more important to your business function

1150
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:52,220
the availability should have a higher

1151
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:54,319
priority in the sense that you can patch

1152
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:56,480
it and ensure the availability with

1153
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,279
minimal downtime as opposed to leaving

1154
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,930
it unpatched and having the risk that

1155
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:04,369
someone destroys your availability and

1156
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:05,930
your you know five nines bye-bye you

1157
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:08,000
know facing an attack although

1158
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:09,410
unfortunately we are forced to often be

1159
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,920
reactive in our field as opposed to

1160
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:14,779
proactive and so I hope that reports

1161
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,599
like this and using the statistics to

1162
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:20,119
show the benefits of being proactive can

1163
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,339
give a little bit more fire and more

1164
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:24,049
weight to our pleas to be able to you

1165
00:48:22,339 --> 00:48:26,839
know take a twenty four-hour downtime

1166
00:48:24,049 --> 00:48:29,859
period to potentially reduce an immense

1167
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:29,859
amount of business impact

1168
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,839
no they don't get that granular

1169
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,700
that's true I don't think we've gotten

1170
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:13,460
there now where there's such granularity

1171
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:15,620
amongst the defensive postures within

1172
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,810
certain industries I think it could

1173
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:20,060
potentially be true you know a major

1174
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:21,830
large healthcare provider should at

1175
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:24,440
least have better security than let's

1176
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:26,690
say like a mom-and-pop dentist but that

1177
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:30,190
large healthcare provider would arguably

1178
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:32,600
also have much more valuable data and so

1179
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:35,120
it's hard to make that kind of

1180
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:39,380
distinction as of now I'm also not sure

1181
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:42,350
that Verizon is brought in to incidents

1182
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,240
of much smaller corporations there their

1183
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:46,700
services much like everyone's services

1184
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,259
and are in this field is not cheap and

1185
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:56,509
so it does take a certain barrier of

1186
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:58,700
entry yeah yeah it's it's it's kind of

1187
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:02,360
the it's the the cruel reality of it

1188
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:05,240
right now a lot of folks in the smaller

1189
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,830
small medium business areas don't even

1190
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,990
have the visibility to understand if

1191
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:10,279
something like this is happening and

1192
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:11,569
that's that's where I think we really

1193
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,480
need to get better in terms of enabling

1194
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:17,210
folks building secure by design systems

1195
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,860
so that you don't need to have you know

1196
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:21,020
core security background or even a

1197
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:24,020
security employee on staff to have a

1198
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:26,290
decent chance of surviving some sort of

1199
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,290
attack

1200
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:51,170
I'm not one to necessarily preach

1201
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:55,320
regulation but I do think it has helped

1202
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:57,390
things like the we saw a huge influx in

1203
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,130
chatter amongst our customers when gdpr

1204
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:02,279
was coming out much like the New York

1205
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:04,610
State Frey our financial regulations so

1206
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:07,530
it's definitely moving the ball

1207
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:10,560
unfortunately it's still far too slow in

1208
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:11,910
my opinion I had an interesting

1209
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,880
conversation along this point with a

1210
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:16,560
colleague his estimation was that it's

1211
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,560
really going to take insurance companies

1212
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:24,750
to start offering cyber insurance and

1213
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:28,290
then some sort of valuation of when does

1214
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:30,390
a breach exceed the capabilities of that

1215
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:31,680
insurance provider where it's no longer

1216
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,509
in their interest to provide that

1217
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,770
insurance service and then the

1218
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:36,660
government will really step in and

1219
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:38,040
increase the regulations because private

1220
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,440
sector will no longer be able to do it

1221
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:44,610
for themself but that I think is many

1222
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:47,970
years out and with the advent of IOT and

1223
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:50,100
embedded devices and ICS becoming more

1224
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:52,970
and more connected I think we need it

1225
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,970
much sooner than that

1226
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:06,339
yep yeah that's where we see it the most

1227
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:09,670
that's kind of what spurred my

1228
00:52:06,339 --> 00:52:11,259
conversation another not speaking to

1229
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:13,029
financial but another interesting data

1230
00:52:11,259 --> 00:52:15,579
point as Bruce Schneier has a really

1231
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:17,200
good book out that talks about kind of

1232
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:17,979
like we're all burning the world is

1233
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,828
coming to an end

1234
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:22,960
not the most optimistic of all books but

1235
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:25,029
he speaks as someone who's also not

1236
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,650
traditionally a fan of regulation he

1237
00:52:25,029 --> 00:52:29,200
speaks very candidly about how his

1238
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,549
experiences in the past have led him to

1239
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,468
the point where he really sees

1240
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:33,219
regulation as the only thing that can do

1241
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:36,039
it at this point

1242
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:37,900
so I'd advocate for everyone you know

1243
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:40,749
not only become involved in political

1244
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:42,400
process but make kind of your passion of

1245
00:52:40,749 --> 00:52:44,799
security your day job of security

1246
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,710
whatever it is that that caused you to

1247
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:50,200
be here today a driving force in the

1248
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:52,420
political process as well we've seen

1249
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,788
that before we've seen great strides

1250
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,670
come as a result of political movement

1251
00:52:54,789 --> 00:52:58,960
so if we could do that for our industry

1252
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:01,630
not only would it be great job security

1253
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,999
for us if we don't need that already but

1254
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:05,499
or don't have that already but I think

1255
00:53:03,999 --> 00:53:08,468
it could could make great strides in our

1256
00:53:05,499 --> 00:53:12,129
kind of defensive posture as as a

1257
00:53:08,469 --> 00:53:14,440
society the election and tampering and

1258
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,969
all of that I think I was very

1259
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:19,029
optimistic that that would that would

1260
00:53:15,969 --> 00:53:21,700
help but that that seem has seems to

1261
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:23,999
have done very little if nothing do you

1262
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,999
have another

1263
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:53,060
absolutely absolutely and I'm a huge

1264
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,740
advocate of embedding with the political

1265
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,540
process you know you don't need to

1266
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:59,060
necessarily you know run for office or

1267
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:01,990
whatnot but spending an hour a week an

1268
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:04,160
hour a month and in volunteering with a

1269
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:06,828
political office or a political party or

1270
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,899
whomever you associate with to just

1271
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:10,220
advise them on security posture if

1272
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,900
you're a networked person help them

1273
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:14,029
shore up their network security if

1274
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,890
you're an application person help them

1275
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:17,650
with their apps even just from an

1276
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:20,000
operational security standpoint and

1277
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:22,130
bringing awareness to patching and in

1278
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,440
really basic kind of computer hygiene

1279
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:28,839
type of opportunities I think those are

1280
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,839
rife within public sector right now I

1281
00:54:30,339 --> 00:54:33,890
think that is all of our time but I'm

1282
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,010
more than happy to continue any

1283
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:37,940
conversation off the stage and thank you

1284
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:40,040
all for your attendance and your

1285
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,300
participation you're welcome to come up

1286
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,980
and I think I have three more little

1287
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,190
Trevor pins left so come on up and grab

1288
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,190
them

1289
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,830
[Applause]

1290
00:54:55,369 --> 00:54:57,430
you
