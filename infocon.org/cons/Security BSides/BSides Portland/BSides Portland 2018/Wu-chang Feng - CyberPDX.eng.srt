1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,970
[Applause]

2
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,380
so I'm going to talk about cyber PDX

3
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,299
this is a camp for broadening

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,980
participation in cyber security that we

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,500
run every summer or we're trying to run

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,019
every summer and I start the camp with a

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,149
quote quote from Barack Obama and a

8
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:36,100
cybersecurity summit and it's one of the

9
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:37,930
great paradoxes the technologies that

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,900
empower us can also be used to undermine

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:43,089
us and inflict great harm and to

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:48,100
paraphrase him it's more tech more

13
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:51,550
problems and so how do we begin to solve

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,340
these problems as a society so I'm an

15
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,959
academic I teach so we learn and then we

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,960
try and teach it to the next generation

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,690
and so that's what what we do and so

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,000
this is the point of Gen cyber which is

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,640
a collaboration between NSF and the NSA

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,979
to build the next generation of

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,810
cybersecurity professionals and this is

22
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:13,600
targeting high schools middle schools to

23
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:16,360
try and impart some of this knowledge

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,190
earlier on in the pipeline so that

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,200
people are aware of that as they go and

26
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,658
and pursue perhaps an undergraduate

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,140
degree okay so these are camps to

28
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:29,289
develop this next generation but what

29
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,090
does a cybersecurity person look like my

30
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:33,399
daughter is in eighth grade and the very

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,020
first thing this the science teacher had

32
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,899
her do was draw a picture of what a

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,360
scientist looks like just to expose the

34
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:43,479
kind of stereotyping they might have to

35
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,099
try and sort of like defeat that and so

36
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,080
I thought about what does it look like

37
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:49,869
like if I ask a kid what does a cyber

38
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:54,399
security professional look like they

39
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:56,379
might give me this which is I mean if we

40
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,129
have a diversity problem that's probably

41
00:01:56,379 --> 00:02:03,340
gotta be a large part of this problem

42
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:04,810
and so this really is a bit of an enigma

43
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,179
because I look around this room and

44
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:11,319
nobody here looks like that which is a

45
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:14,080
problem right so what we try and do is

46
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,000
we try to expose them to all the

47
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,510
different roles you could play in this

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,050
discipline so including you could be the

49
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,629
cryptographer so you could be like

50
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,990
goldwasser and Macaulay you could be the

51
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:32,320
politician so Ron Wyden gave the keynote

52
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,069
two years ago here at besides you could

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,810
be at

54
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:37,298
at level influencing cybersecurity

55
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,459
issues you could be the research

56
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:43,599
director so Deborah Frank runs the

57
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:45,700
research programs at PNNL you could be

58
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,649
the journalist Brian Krebs Glenn

59
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,679
Greenwald impacting cybersecurity

60
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,519
through their writing you could be the

61
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,889
bug hunter

62
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,079
so Natalie Solana vich Tavis Ormandy you

63
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:56,769
could be finding those deep

64
00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:00,340
vulnerabilities that nobody else can

65
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:03,639
even see you could be the filmmaker so

66
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,079
Alex Gibney was did the zero-days film

67
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,439
which is a highly influential

68
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:11,139
documentary on the Stuxnet worm our

69
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,638
virus or whatever you malware you could

70
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:15,129
be the systems developer so this is

71
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,109
Jesse Frisell who has worked a lot on

72
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:19,840
docker which is being used in a lot of

73
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:22,060
enterprises today you could be a

74
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,579
television producer how many of you know

75
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,180
that mr. robot is on for another another

76
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,280
season

77
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,480
it's a highly into a fourth season I

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,879
think this is last week you could be the

79
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,760
professor so Laurie Craner professor at

80
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,918
CMU went to the FTC developing all sorts

81
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,578
of interesting ideas on password

82
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:45,129
security or you could be the cartoonist

83
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:48,129
it's Randall Munroe influencing

84
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:49,540
technical ideas using cartoons like this

85
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:51,009
one down here on the bottom right this

86
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,840
is what I teach in my web security class

87
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:54,819
it's like yeah here's here's some

88
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,409
entropy right here yeah and the bottom

89
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:00,189
right just read this cartoon and you'll

90
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:02,560
get what I'm trying to teach you oh yeah

91
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:05,409
there's the heartbleed cartoon that that

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,540
also is an interesting explanation for

93
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:08,918
that you could be a Crypt analyst so

94
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,259
this is a book that just got released

95
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,819
two years ago on the most successful

96
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:17,469
Code Breaker in world war one in World

97
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:19,988
War two Elizabeth Friedman you could be

98
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:21,548
the comedian so we play the job clips

99
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,289
from John Oliver especially when he's

100
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,638
interviewing Edward Snowden you know

101
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:25,990
getting to the heart of the fact that

102
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
yeah maybe some of the things you did

103
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,710
you know helped but maybe some of the

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,940
things you disclosed might not have been

105
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:36,159
appropriate to to disclose you could be

106
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,780
the podcaster and I know Joe is not in

107
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:41,289
the room but he just gave an interview

108
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:44,789
to two weeks ago on on risky business so

109
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:46,880
you could be Patrick gray or Adam wallow

110
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:48,890
you could be the lawyer

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,350
Susan Hennessy who works on all

112
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,539
different kinds of governmental policies

113
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,180
and legal policies dealing with

114
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:59,000
cyberspace you could be the ethical

115
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:02,350
hacker joanna rutkowska of cubes and and

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,020
blue pill you could be sue Nomo

117
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:08,750
shimomura catching hackers like kevin

118
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,700
Mitnick or he could be an author so this

119
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,550
is a picture of Veronica Roth she wrote

120
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,680
this short story on penetration testing

121
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,150
based on the fictional divergent

122
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,430
storyline how many of you know about

123
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,159
divergent if you have a kid they'll know

124
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:25,430
about it and this is what we used for

125
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,010
our one of our threads in this camp

126
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,050
because we thought it was an interesting

127
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:34,520
way of weaving the arts into

128
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:36,500
cybersecurity so with this in mind how

129
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,130
do you offer a camp that speaks to all

130
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:43,640
of these diverse roles right what do you

131
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:46,000
teach and how do you teach it so this is

132
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,740
what I'm going to talk about cyber PDX

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,240
it's a one-week residential camp for

134
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,950
introducing cyber security to high

135
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,360
school students and teachers so it's

136
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,340
really important for us to get at the

137
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,960
teachers because that's where your

138
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,340
leverage point is because they can bring

139
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,590
that curriculum back to their schools

140
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,239
and then and then you get this sort of

141
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,650
this beneficial effect that you can't

142
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,850
get just by teaching students directly

143
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,140
so what's our approach we have a

144
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,930
curriculum that integrates technology

145
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,479
and the liberal arts we think that they

146
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,980
go and hand in hand and if you were at

147
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,950
the keynote you'll understand some of

148
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:22,850
these problems have to involve the

149
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:26,659
liberal arts focus on collaborative

150
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,490
cooperative and peer learning exercises

151
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,320
and not on competition because

152
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:34,370
competition does drive out a lot of

153
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,469
people from this discipline we have

154
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,970
exercises that allow each student to

155
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,770
practice different roles in

156
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,840
cybersecurity so they're role-playing

157
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,609
different aspects of cybersecurity just

158
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,989
to try them out who knows what's going

159
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:51,200
to stick problems we focus on

160
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:53,480
problem-based learning that that we have

161
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,969
exercises that are intrinsically

162
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,210
motivating for them to want to complete

163
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,559
and this is something I talked about two

164
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,209
years ago

165
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:05,899
the design of the crypto threat in fact

166
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:07,819
was based on a bunch of puzzles and who

167
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:10,729
doesn't like to solve puzzles

168
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:13,189
we have multimodal instruction so to

169
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:15,469
engage like the physical learner the

170
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:18,139
visual learner different styles of

171
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:19,998
learning and teaching to engage students

172
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:24,049
wherever they are wherever they're best

173
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:26,239
at at learning scaffolded exercise and

174
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:28,369
the real important thing here is that we

175
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:29,719
want these kids to have to feel like

176
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:32,029
they're both competent and have

177
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:33,919
confidence in anything that they do in

178
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:35,689
the camp the goal is to have every

179
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,599
single camper be able to complete every

180
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:41,809
single exercise in the camp so that's

181
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:46,909
that's where the design is really I

182
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:49,789
think important we inclusively target

183
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:51,229
students from underrepresented who are

184
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:53,628
underrepresented not only in

185
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:55,849
cybersecurity but in college so we're

186
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:57,529
looking at socio-economic deep diversity

187
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:59,419
we're looking at ethnic diversity we're

188
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:00,949
looking at gender diversity and we're

189
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:03,198
telling the teachers who are doing the

190
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:04,969
recruiting for us find the students who

191
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,129
you would never think would go into

192
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,610
cybersecurity or computer science or

193
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:10,159
even better

194
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,089
none of those - or to college those are

195
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:17,119
the people that we want in the camp and

196
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:19,369
then finally we run alongside of this a

197
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:21,409
teacher camp and we have these teachers

198
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:24,079
develop curriculum projects of their own

199
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:26,599
based on the concept that that have been

200
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,099
presented to them at camp and this

201
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:29,509
allows them to own a curriculum that

202
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:32,179
they can then go back to their high

203
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:35,779
schools to actually teach to their

204
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:37,968
students so just to get a little bit of

205
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:39,740
a more detail about what we teach in

206
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:41,659
this camp we have four threads we have a

207
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,490
cryptography and security we have a

208
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,970
programming thread a filmmaking thread

209
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,069
and a cyber policy thread so the

210
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,990
cryptography and security thread we

211
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:53,589
talking about how ciphers work how they

212
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:56,449
can eventually be broken we talk about

213
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:59,470
different security tools that are used

214
00:08:56,449 --> 00:09:01,639
in industry and and how they work and

215
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:05,600
this was something I described a couple

216
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:07,309
years ago at b-sides we base this we

217
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,639
have this divergent theme capture the

218
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:13,219
flag and urban race and basically this

219
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,090
the the content modules there are five

220
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,010
of them

221
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,810
we start with the historical impact so

222
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,880
we're always focusing on motivation why

223
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,560
would you be interested in in

224
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,720
cryptography and security so we do some

225
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,819
history we cover different ciphers in

226
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,070
World War 1 World War 2 and how they

227
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,680
really shifted the course of those two

228
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,060
Wars and then we go into basic encoding

229
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,709
because cryptography is done into

230
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,689
digital domain so we have to teach them

231
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:38,090
what binary is and and these sorts of

232
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,320
things and ASCII and and all the

233
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,750
different ways you can encode digital

234
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,480
information we go to simple ciphers that

235
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,130
can be broken fairly easily and they

236
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,680
sort of analyze these things and reverse

237
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:52,370
engineer their encoding we talk about

238
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,469
modern ciphers and how for example

239
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,990
public key cryptography works and how

240
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,280
that how it can be used to secure

241
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,780
transactions over the Internet and then

242
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,270
we talk about men in the middle attacks

243
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,890
so that even if you do have public key

244
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,930
cryptography if you can't get someone's

245
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,490
public key appropriately and if you're

246
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,530
in the middle so basically the NSA

247
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,820
program by the Flying Pig program we

248
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,860
talk about how that whole thing can be

249
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,830
subverted and in this thread they can

250
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,360
now see from the beginning sort of the

251
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,790
initial sort of forms of cryptography

252
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,380
all the way to modern programs that are

253
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,849
trying to hijack the security of people

254
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,040
so they actually feel like they have a

255
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:28,730
pretty good understanding of these

256
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,819
concepts so this is all built into a

257
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:33,710
scaffolded CTF activity that leads to an

258
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,780
urban race where there the whole thing

259
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:38,870
is role-playing inside of the divergent

260
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:41,120
plot which is from the short story which

261
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,860
is a ripoff of that short story and then

262
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,400
right at the end there dropped into the

263
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,680
plot live their messaging this Twitter

264
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,530
bot that that's basically cyber 4 and

265
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,959
they're trying to help this character

266
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,189
out to save the city so save Portland

267
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,740
because Portland is about to get blown

268
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:00,440
up and then the idea is that every team

269
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:07,670
should be able to save the city and so

270
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:09,290
far every team has most more or less but

271
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,670
they're running all over campus like

272
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,230
some of the things they have to decode

273
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,569
and solve there they're running all over

274
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,460
the Portland State campus and having a

275
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,290
grand old time all that content is

276
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,060
available so this is actually being run

277
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,180
in like Lewis and Clark at Lincoln High

278
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,800
School Village home resources so we

279
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,599
actually have this curriculum the

280
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,529
instructor material is there and people

281
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,779
can just you

282
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,759
and run this anywhere you'd like all the

283
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,999
all all the material that you need to

284
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:37,129
run this curriculum is public the other

285
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:39,290
thread is the programming thread and the

286
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,089
idea here is a lot of them haven't seen

287
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,009
haven't been so a lot of these schools

288
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:44,899
don't have computer science at all so we

289
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:47,749
try and teach them sort of the ideas of

290
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:50,240
programming and what we really want to

291
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:52,910
impart is the the the idea that

292
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,889
computing computer programming is it's

293
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:58,910
fraught with errors right like and you

294
00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:00,769
can't start to rely on code without

295
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,529
understanding that a lot of code doesn't

296
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:05,540
work so that's one of the things we try

297
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:07,399
and talk to them about so we start them

298
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,439
out with blockly and then we go into

299
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,660
Python programming with turtle graphics

300
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:13,879
we talked to them about you know

301
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,379
encapsulation and abstraction and sort

302
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,809
of these software methods for managing

303
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:19,759
complexity and then they do a final

304
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:23,870
project to it with that includes a code

305
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:26,029
walkthrough at a showcase another the

306
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,740
third thread is the film thread so we

307
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:31,850
talked about the influence of movies

308
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:34,040
historically on policy and then and how

309
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:37,399
they how it changes public perception

310
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,559
that leads to things things like laws

311
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,389
changing and then we talk about the

312
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,550
techniques that are used within each of

313
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:45,889
these films to get that emotional impact

314
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,149
because if you develop an impactful film

315
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:49,189
using all these different techniques

316
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:51,500
then that's where your highest lever of

317
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:55,819
change can be as a cyber security

318
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:58,129
professional and so some of the movies

319
00:12:55,819 --> 00:13:01,490
that we have shown we show the imitation

320
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:03,740
game we show wargames just for the

321
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,350
impact that these particular films have

322
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:11,839
had on on perception and then we show

323
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:13,939
hidden figures as well so we also teach

324
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,529
them the film methods right so a lot of

325
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:17,120
them have never done any sort of

326
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,559
filmmaking they're shooting a lot of

327
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,300
videos on their cell phones but they're

328
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,059
not really composing them the way that

329
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,349
you would want to to to influence

330
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:26,959
perception so we talked about camera

331
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,569
angles camera movement camera shot size

332
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,339
and its effects and then they get a

333
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:33,439
daily film assignment that they're

334
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:35,629
forced to incorporate themes of the camp

335
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:38,179
themes of security themes of

336
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:41,059
cryptography perhaps in a film that

337
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:41,540
speaks speaks about those topics they

338
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:43,100
edit

339
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,149
load these things and then we watch them

340
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:49,490
and give them feedback and then the last

341
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:51,199
one is the cyber policy thread so we

342
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,209
talk about social and legal problems

343
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,130
brought about by technology and the

344
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:57,229
importance of having policymakers who

345
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,360
know something about technology I think

346
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,790
we're lucky to have Ron Wyden as our

347
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,589
senator but not everybody is like that

348
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,269
not every senator is like that and

349
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:07,180
they're voting on these things that

350
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:10,639
might actually make things a lot worse

351
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:13,008
so we also focus on collaborative

352
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,709
problem solving to address these policy

353
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:17,899
issues and so this speaks to the soft

354
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:19,339
skills we have to have students in this

355
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,420
next generation to be able to go

356
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:22,670
face-to-face with someone they

357
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,889
completely disagree with and still find

358
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,829
common ground so we completely lost that

359
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:33,680
in you know in today's fragmented filter

360
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:35,120
bubble sort of makeup and so we with the

361
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,839
cyber policy thread we talked about

362
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,910
constitutional law surveillance programs

363
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,569
security versus privacy spearfishing and

364
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:46,189
fake news and how we need policies to

365
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:48,560
manage all of this stuff but we need

366
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:51,860
policies that have all the stakeholders

367
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,810
agree on what that policy is and so what

368
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,000
we do is we give them role dossiers of

369
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,069
all the stakeholders in a debate so for

370
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,230
example controlling fake news well you

371
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:02,810
have like the head of the NSA the lawyer

372
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,819
the ACLU lawyer the journalist you have

373
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,709
all these people with different views

374
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:09,410
and different stakes in this problem and

375
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:12,529
then we have them we have them learn

376
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,240
their won dossier really well and then

377
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:15,709
they network with each other to find all

378
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,449
of the information about all the other

379
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:18,680
dossiers so they have a good

380
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,529
understanding of all the different

381
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,329
stakeholders using this student mixer

382
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:26,540
and then we have this cyber summit which

383
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:29,839
is modeled after Barack Obama's cyber

384
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,849
summit from 2014 where they do nine

385
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,459
rounds of alternating discussions to try

386
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,290
and formulate policy right and so they

387
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:37,910
go back and forth between caucusing with

388
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,250
other students who have their same role

389
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,350
to get more depth for what what they

390
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,149
need to be advocating and then they go

391
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,670
back to the negotiating table and so we

392
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:48,439
have ten tables trying to develop ten

393
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,599
different policies to address a problem

394
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,959
like fake news and then we go through

395
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,340
them after and

396
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:58,260
talk about them this leads to a pivot so

397
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:01,710
this is sort of the climax of the cyber

398
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:04,250
policy / film thread where it's a crisis

399
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:06,570
situation modeled after the cyber 912

400
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,670
competitions which are undergraduate

401
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,430
competitions sort of like the Model UN

402
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,349
is and so they synthesize what they've

403
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,150
learned into a five-minute film that

404
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,670
addresses the crisis that addresses the

405
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:20,819
policy concerns in a video that we end

406
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:23,099
up showing at the final showcase so in

407
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,020
the past when Pokemon go was was the

408
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,360
thing two summers ago or three summers

409
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,010
ago we had the zero day exploit that the

410
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,710
NSA was using to track terrorists and

411
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:35,010
criminal activity and so what is that

412
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,690
good policy or you know what is the sort

413
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,660
of the trade-off between the privacy of

414
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,940
a legitimate user versus trying to you

415
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,880
know fight crime so that was that was

416
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:48,020
one of the pivots last year we did a

417
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,220
nation-state attack on the 2018 election

418
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:54,560
which hopefully isn't gonna be replayed

419
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,790
this election I don't know okay so

420
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,459
evaluation we've been doing this for a

421
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,709
while 2014 and 2015 it was a cyber

422
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,720
discovery camp the last three years it's

423
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:06,030
been a gen cyber camp it's offered to

424
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,530
rising 10th grade students and this is

425
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,329
to give them time to take this content

426
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,490
go back to their high schools and be

427
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:14,159
able to sort of spread that right to

428
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:18,450
those folks these are the ten schools

429
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,300
from last July if you have a freshman in

430
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:23,069
any of these high schools get them these

431
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,950
are likely going to be similar to the

432
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:28,560
high schools will be participating this

433
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:30,600
coming year get them on the cyber PDX

434
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,389
team and we hope to see them in the in

435
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:37,560
the summer if if the end of gen cyber

436
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:41,660
gives us money for it this is this is

437
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:45,149
our results so we have the 2016 and 2017

438
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:48,920
Student Survey results so 60 plus

439
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:51,720
percent female around 40-ish percent

440
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,660
ethnic minorities and then 20 teachers

441
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:58,320
each so about 60 students every year do

442
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:00,870
this if you look at the ratings they're

443
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,360
above 4 in terms of they had fun they

444
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,149
learned a lot they feel the other one

445
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,488
they were glad they attended the camp

446
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:09,949
this is what you want as a first

447
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:12,559
experience in cybersecurity and this is

448
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,080
why the curriculum and the exercises

449
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,918
were done the way they were to get that

450
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:22,369
first positive experience in terms of

451
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,619
comparison to other gen cyber camps one

452
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:26,869
of the things we do is we target

453
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:29,599
underrepresented groups so if you look

454
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:32,269
at that first row you see that for Gen

455
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:35,359
cyber participants the pre camp intent

456
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:37,909
to pursue a career in cyber is lower

457
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,728
than the national average but we do more

458
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:43,009
for the the people then if you look at

459
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:45,469
the change between before camp and after

460
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:56,419
camp it's quite substantially higher

461
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:59,389
than the national average so yes in

462
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:00,919
progress a longitudinal study of

463
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,968
students is currently in progress we

464
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,279
have someone from the School of

465
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:07,309
Education who is going through IRB

466
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:09,529
approval to do some tracking longer term

467
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:12,499
just to say yes this is the approach

468
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:15,259
that that we can say you know first for

469
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:21,769
sure well not for sure but it does seem

470
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:23,570
to work okay so cyber PDX 2019 we're

471
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:25,999
actually looking for sponsors just in

472
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,279
case Gen cyber cuts are cuts the budget

473
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:30,109
we're also looking for volunteers we're

474
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:31,879
trying to do an extra day at camp we're

475
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:33,769
trying to maintain our teacher stipends

476
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:36,709
where where the gen cyber is trying to

477
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:39,559
get us to basically cut them in half the

478
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,570
teacher program is essential for us it's

479
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,279
like we can't wait like it makes no

480
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,718
sense if we're just teaching students

481
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,869
like we have to teach the teachers

482
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:51,399
otherwise the the leverage is gone we

483
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:54,589
are trying to start up a Yubikey module

484
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:56,238
to FA for all so we're trying to raise

485
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:59,089
money to get a whole bunch of you bikies

486
00:19:56,239 --> 00:20:00,830
to us and teach a Yubikey module a

487
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:03,139
two-factor authentication module in camp

488
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,789
that we can then send teachers with this

489
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:06,678
curriculum and a whole bunch of ub keys

490
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:08,809
back to their high schools to get to

491
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:12,559
factor for all and this is something

492
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:15,139
that we're begging for money for so this

493
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,539
is why and I'm begging on behalf of

494
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:18,979
Ellie Harmon who's our camp director she

495
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:20,809
couldn't make it today

496
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,480

they have an after-school program and

533

they want to learn something this would

534
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,049
be a curriculum that we could just drop

535
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:48,889
in place and then have them run over

536
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:52,039
