1
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,090
Thanks

2
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:22,640
so I have a story to tell about how we

3
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,189
were able to use games of a couple of

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,310
different kinds to help raise the level

5
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:31,160
of awareness and with a security within

6
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,628
our organization and also just try to

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,550
give people a chance to brush up on

8
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:38,260
their skills in ways that may not come

9
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:41,629
up and as part of their everyday career

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,968
got the obligatory about me slide my the

11
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:46,250
best qualifications I have our number

12
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:49,130
one I'm a big geek and number two I love

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,780
playing games that's pretty much it of

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,940
course if you're a an old-school

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,110
hardcore geek this will tell you

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,460
everything you need to know about me

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,640
probably more than you want to know

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,710
about me and of course I have to start

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,030
off by saying that these are my thoughts

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,829
my ideas my story my mistakes and anyone

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,719
that I work with or work for may not

22
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:10,639
necessarily agree with endorse or

23
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,750
certainly wouldn't consider me

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,369
representing them up here doing that

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,600
they have they're starting to hell they

26
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,189
can come up here and do this so that's

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,640
kind of how I feel about that so enough

28
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:22,100
of that let's talk about games now if

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,509
you let the historians or the

30
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,520
anthropologist tell the story they'll

31
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:27,350
probably tell you that humans have been

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,109
playing games as long as there's been

33
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,119
humans and it seems like as soon as we

34
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:34,068
figure out what to eat and make sure

35
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,990
nothing else has us on its list of

36
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:37,909
things to eat we want to spend a lot of

37
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,158
the intervening time frittering away

38
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:42,979
playing games and wasting time

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,399
but it's not so much a waste of time I

40
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:47,658
think there's a a method to this madness

41
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,729
when you think about it where do we get

42
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,310
our initial download of operational data

43
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:53,990
for how to be humans we start off

44
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,719
interacting directly with the world

45
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,699
through games through play we learn how

46
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,439
to figure out how to make our bodies do

47
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,450
complex maneuvers without falling over

48
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,880
that's a pretty good one basic life

49
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,049
skills we first encounter and learn

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,240
these things through games through

51
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:10,369
playing now as we go on of course the

52
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,270
games get more sophisticated we learn

53
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:15,640
things about language and the nuances of

54
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,200
communication we learn about strategy

55
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,569
now opponent against you know someone

56
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,179
else is trying to out think us we learn

57
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:25,640
about resource management we learn how

58
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,460
to build a castle on the frontier of a

59
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,600
French Empire as you do and sometimes we

60
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,930
play games that banish

61
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,390
- the weird table at lunch but even in a

62
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,950
situation like this we learn practical

63
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,320
things right what does this game teach

64
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,790
us well we learn that not every

65
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,620
encounter with another person is a

66
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,450
zero-sum game we don't have to make

67
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,060
someone else lose for us to win we learn

68
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:50,359
how to band together as a group as a

69
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,840
team and accomplish a common goal we

70
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,840
learn engineering design we learn

71
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,130
imagination creative writing I think one

72
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,800
of the most important things we learn is

73
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,329
that despite our best intentions and

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,240
careful planning things don't always go

75
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:08,000
right and can you think on your feet to

76
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,600
come up with a plan B when you discover

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,040
something now there's a lot of this

78
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,340
information that we try to still convey

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,929
in more traditional settings someone

80
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,420
will stand in a room in front of you and

81
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,010
tell you facts and that's part of the

82
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,380
learning process - but it really

83
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,720
shouldn't be the only part of it

84
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,540
otherwise you get audiences that look

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,820
like this okay yes but and that leads to

86
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,340
a lot of frustration when you go to

87
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,320
apply things because you know hey look

88
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,170
I've been told I need to implement this

89
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,299
circuit or design or reverse engineer or

90
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,950
debug something and I've tried it three

91
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,780
times already and I'm just not getting

92
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,530
it and this is too hard and I just

93
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,630
wasn't cut out for this I quit

94
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,030
but you put in a game scenario what

95
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,040
happens the 37th time in a row we've

96
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,630
crashed our mario card into a tree or

97
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,670
we've fallen off a level in some game

98
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,820
our reaction is okay I'll get it this

99
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,410
time set it back up again especially if

100
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,579
there's a little bit of competition with

101
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,990
the person sitting next to you with

102
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,570
their controller and you want to just

103
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:11,450
get one more second off your time now

104
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:14,540
the idea of using games as a teaching

105
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,488
vehicle is something that isn't new I'm

106
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,070
not the first person to think of it by

107
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:20,750
far it's been in the news lately it's

108
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,550
also been the subject of a number of

109
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,010
academic papers and conference

110
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,050
presentations and even a master's thesis

111
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,659
here and there so people are talking

112
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,460
about it they're looking at it I didn't

113
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,410
start my journey by looking at the

114
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,010
material or any of the research or

115
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:39,080
reading about in the news I started by

116
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,729
having the leader of our red team work

117
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,479
come to me with a question I never

118
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:48,990
thought I would actually hear at work

119
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:52,020
asked of me but his thought was how we

120
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:55,190
approach this sort of adversarial war

121
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,560
game kind of scenario how do we learn to

122
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:02,580
think like our enemy how do we learn how

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,320
to defend against them says that's a lot

124
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,330
like a game let's make a game out of it

125
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,870
instead of talking theory let's roleplay

126
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:12,359
it let's simulate it and one of his

127
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,610
points was whenever we do it the other

128
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,860
way it's a real pain to get people to

129
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,490
actually show up and participate but you

130
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,870
say we're gonna do a tabletop exercise

131
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,850
D&D for systems and mins or whatever

132
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,590
people show up and they get into it it

133
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,240
gets fun and they still learn the

134
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,460
strategies and work out how to do the

135
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,380
the actual work it helps you get into

136
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,039
the mindset of who you're going up

137
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:38,940
against and to think in terms of not

138
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,520
only theory but scenarios and what

139
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,710
happens next after this event and what

140
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,390
do I do and I respond this way oh and

141
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,109
that was countered by the other player

142
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:52,169
doing something what next my point of

143
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,630
view was not so much the red team effort

144
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:57,450
but just in general thinking about how

145
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,000
to help my colleagues build up their

146
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,349
acumen for different kinds of security

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,550
work and we do a lot of different kinds

148
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,430
of work if you look across our whole

149
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,260
team but using games a lot of the

150
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,580
similar way think in terms of scenarios

151
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,980
what happens next think about

152
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,530
problem-solving and above all make the

153
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,500
whole thing fun enough that people want

154
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,900
to stay engaged and you yeah even here

155
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,180
you can use competition to keep it fun

156
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,950
and keep people motivated and that

157
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,870
actually turned out to be a lot more of

158
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,420
a advantage than I originally would have

159
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,560
thought now one thing that's important

160
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,510
if you're thinking about doing something

161
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,090
like this is to know who you're working

162
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,740
with now the obvious angle of that of

163
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,469
course is that everybody has a different

164
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,960
level of experience you have your your

165
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,210
hardcore red team that can tear apart

166
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,299
hardware and know what's going on you

167
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,979
have people that live in word processors

168
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,100
all day writing policy documents and

169
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,290
everything in between but everybody has

170
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,720
something that they can gain by getting

171
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,340
into this and you can use the mechanics

172
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,130
of the game you set up to

173
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,989
helped overcome that obstacle and also

174
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,490
even leverage leverage it to your

175
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,500
advantage give someone you'd give

176
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,940
everyone another a feeling like they

177
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,660
have a reason to be there and something

178
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:13,650
they can accomplish the other angle of

179
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,510
it is not as obvious and I think of this

180
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,489
as the system indents because there was

181
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,820
one time I was at a conference years ago

182
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,900
I think it was a UNIX Lisa conference

183
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,330
and unfortunately the only thing that I

184
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,070
remember now of that whole conference

185
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,740
was one of the evening activities the

186
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:31,889
organisers had set up a dance in one of

187
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,270
the grand ballrooms of the hotel for

188
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:37,860
systems administrators now I'm not

189
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:40,460
saying sis admins can't dance but all

190
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,780
I'm saying is I was in this ballroom

191
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,909
with a couple hundred of my colleagues

192
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,770
and they were variously standing and

193
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,240
sitting on the dance floor talking about

194
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,330
network topologies and how to set up

195
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,460
file servers while the most confused

196
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,469
band in the world played on wondering

197
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,440
what in the world was going on in this

198
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:01,500
venue it's really important to

199
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,700
understand the expectations of the

200
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,090
people you're working with we made a

201
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:10,349
mistake with this in terms of this talk

202
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:12,060
I'll share that we had a class it was

203
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,500
for intermediate and advanced

204
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,260
application developers it was an

205
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,810
application security class and we taught

206
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,240
them how to look for exploits how to how

207
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,789
to exploit them how to prevent them it

208
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,380
was great we had an in-class lab which

209
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:27,510
gave them the opportunity here's some

210
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,039
intentionally vulnerable apps let's walk

211
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:32,789
through the process of breaking them

212
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,860
works great as things went on we decided

213
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,569
to move it to a self-service online kind

214
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,279
of class nothing wrong with that so the

215
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,620
labs went along we hosted them in their

216
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,838
own little server that's fine somewhere

217
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,830
along the road we came up with a new

218
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:49,529
class that was an introductory level a

219
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:52,350
security awareness class also a great

220
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:57,360
idea somehow we stuck those labs with

221
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:59,640
that class and we've expected we might

222
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:05,450
have some problems with the the ability

223
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:08,699
level so we addressed that we solved it

224
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,080
if you ever played the the old infocomm

225
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,820
games back in the 80s or

226
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,770
90s and bruh how they had the hint book

227
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,780
where you could reveal clues one at a

228
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,730
time the one starts with maybe go over

229
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,110
there and look at things and at the end

230
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,580
you get down to the clue that says go

231
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,800
take the thing put it in the other thing

232
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,360
push the blue button and we did that

233
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,490
with these labs so that they would go

234
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,260
through the experience of doing it even

235
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,970
if they had to be led step-by-step and

236
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,650
it was even things that said right here

237
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:35,700
this text right here that's the that's

238
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:39,120
the thing and people some people

239
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,860
rebelled against this because we were so

240
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,520
mismatched with their expectations not

241
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,350
the ability level but they came into it

242
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,250
saying I don't understand why you're

243
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,410
having me do this

244
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,660
this doesn't compute in what I thought I

245
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,560
was doing by taking this class and there

246
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:59,180
we missed it so just to underscore that

247
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:02,609
that's actually a surprise for us anyway

248
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:04,880
now where I came into this was actually

249
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,530
very casual never intended to start

250
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,080
building any kind of a system or a game

251
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,790
framework I simply said hey you know be

252
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,770
a great idea if we had some kind of

253
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,800
little puzzle some kind of challenges we

254
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,210
could throw out to the security team and

255
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,219
this started off in an email and

256
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,690
sometimes in meetings would say hey for

257
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,770
this week why don't you try solving this

258
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,560
it could be something simple like this

259
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:27,360
cryptogram and then we'll come back next

260
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,400
we can talk about the answer sometimes

261
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,680
the challenge was figuring out what the

262
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,470
question was in the first place and

263
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,910
maybe maybe getting past the point of

264
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,470
wondering if the challenge is whether I

265
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,469
should scan this thing into my phone in

266
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,590
the first place or not fair enough and

267
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:46,320
as time went on we started getting more

268
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:49,380
sophisticated with it and one of the

269
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,870
things I developed that I wanted to try

270
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,480
and do more of was to guide people's

271
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,330
thinking out of the normal avenues they

272
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,920
were used to in their jobs and so it

273
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:02,400
have a challenge this is an example of

274
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:05,189
one of them later on in the game I said

275
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,260
consider a hypothetical padlock digital

276
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,570
padlock has four digits you'd type in on

277
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,610
a keypad and if you get the right digits

278
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,720
it'll open if not a little flash of LED

279
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,150
or something telling you what's wrong

280
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,680
pretty simple concept but in setting

281
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:20,490
this up I wanted to make sure we had

282
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,319
several steps that the first one or two

283
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,529
were really easy for people that haven't

284
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,810
thought about this kind of

285
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:27,819
security before and could still have an

286
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,290
aha moment and then we get deeper from

287
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:32,829
that but I wanted to make sure we get

288
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:35,439
out of the the the initial reaction so

289
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:36,089
the first question is how secure does

290
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:41,110
that sound

291
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:42,790
now we think about it four digits if I

292
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,759
had to brute forces to have to type in

293
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,649
all the digits zero zero zero zero nope

294
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,009
zero zero zero one no that's not it

295
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:50,290
either

296
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:54,279
oh that sounds complicated and when you

297
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:57,248
think about it a mechanical padlock

298
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:59,499
that's really complicated it's got all

299
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,449
the different positions those the

300
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:03,249
different bidding patterns you know I

301
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:04,959
don't know how people pick locks but it

302
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:06,999
sounds magic makes you have to try it

303
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,309
maybe all of the teeth are all the way

304
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:11,709
down maybe one up maybe one up a little

305
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,999
more until you finally get the one that

306
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:14,349
makes the lock open I mean that would

307
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:16,959
take forever I don't know how people can

308
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,370
pick locks and this is electronic and I

309
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,109
don't even begin to understand how

310
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,569
that's approached so it's got to be

311
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,980
secure that's the initial mindset of

312
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,969
someone that doesn't think about secure

313
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,629
years and familiar with the kind of

314
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:31,779
devices and so the first step was I said

315
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:33,370
just quantify it how many times how many

316
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:37,480
different numbers would you have to try

317
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,439
before you had tried them all and get

318
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,029
them to say okay well there's four

319
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:43,449
digits so there's 10,000 possible

320
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:45,399
combinations what I want to get here is

321
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:47,589
four especially the beginners to get out

322
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,990
of the mindset of it's complicated so

323
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:51,790
it's secure okay if you could figure out

324
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,470
well exactly how complicated is it

325
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,870
that's your first step in challenging

326
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,269
your assumptions and this is a phrase I

327
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,889
said so much in the application security

328
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:01,300
classes I had a co-worker wanted me to

329
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:03,279
put on a t-shirt and just wear it around

330
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,109
all the time

331
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,000
but this is probably the biggest thing

332
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,350
that we want to try to accomplish people

333
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,819
is to get them to challenge the

334
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,009
assumption that they make when they

335
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:14,199
first look at a problem and so said okay

336
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:16,689
having done that now the next part of

337
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:19,719
this challenge was a researcher has come

338
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:20,740
to you and she claims that she can use a

339
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,420
technique where she's still

340
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,429
brute-forcing she's trying each

341
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,819
combination till one opens she's not got

342
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:29,649
some way to look inside the lock but she

343
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:34,300
can do it worst case in 40 instead of

344
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:35,980
10,000 whoa so the first question though

345
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,939
is this even credible is it plausible

346
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,420
could

347
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,100
possibly happen and I said she says that

348
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,979
this was caused by a common software

349
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,110
security flaw so what I wanted to do

350
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,200
here is to get them thinking all right

351
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,630
is it possible what is the relationship

352
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,870
between ten thousand and forty is there

353
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:57,490
something there that leads me to what

354
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,950
you might be doing which in this case

355
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,930
would be identifying each individual

356
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,660
number separately and not all in

357
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,040
combination and also the fact that if

358
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,329
you're familiar with common software

359
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,449
design flaws you might are to be

360
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:13,000
thinking about side-channel timing

361
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,920
attack something like that but if not

362
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,560
you have something to Google for and if

363
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,849
you look at the top 15 or 20 security

364
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,130
flaws something that will lead you to

365
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,810
some ideas especially if you figured out

366
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,810
maybe it was trying each digit at a time

367
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:30,730
it's kind of like the whole idea of the

368
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,990
the physical padlock people don't pick

369
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,580
locks by trying every combination

370
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:38,050
together they they exploit the fact that

371
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,850
we don't manufacture things perfectly

372
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,020
every time

373
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,990
well people sometimes forget is software

374
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,490
works the same way so then is that

375
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,110
having done that question three and this

376
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,670
is where I really wanted them to think

377
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,890
beyond oh here here's how we can break

378
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,719
the lock open okay what would you tell

379
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,980
the developers to prevent this from

380
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,900
being a vulnerability in the future

381
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,070
because ultimately we want to make sure

382
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,459
that we not only identified

383
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,450
vulnerabilities but close them and so by

384
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,010
getting them to challenged our

385
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,020
assumptions getting to think step by

386
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,220
step a lot of people came out of this

387
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,449
one saying well I hadn't actually

388
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,180
thought all the way through a problem

389
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:15,610
like that before

390
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:16,660
overall we also had some that were there

391
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,920
they actually had a stand up some

392
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,480
software that they would they would

393
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,099
communicate with so we say okay telnet

394
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,750
to port 1970 tell that or whatever

395
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,440
somehow you connect to the port and it

396
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,820
sends back something like this and we

397
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,730
explained what it was we didn't like

398
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,350
Surprise them with hey here's this thing

399
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:40,000
this turns out if you're also a geek

400
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:41,980
like me use is a game of life board this

401
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,350
is a perennial favorite just shows up in

402
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,300
puzzles and computer challenges all the

403
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,960
time it's in several CTF is probably all

404
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,740
the CTF but the idea is it's a very nice

405
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,350
simple

406
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:56,230
problem that you can then base these

407
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,250
exercises on because it simulates life

408
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,839
in a petri dish

409
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,240
you have very simple rules that

410
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:03,040
determine generation generation where

411
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,880
cells will survive where new ones be

412
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,770
born and where old ins will die and you

413
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,480
can code that pretty simply and then we

414
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:12,520
can do some things around it I'm enough

415
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,160
of the geeky I actually will spend time

416
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,410
in years past in a boring meeting or a

417
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,209
class or something doing it on paper but

418
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,390
that's are you afraid back to slide one

419
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:23,649
I'm a geek I just have to live with that

420
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:26,110
so people connect to the port and it

421
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,120
spits us out and so you go aha it's a

422
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,970
game of life board I know the drill

423
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,170
I look at this I can even in my head go

424
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,390
through in a piece of paper and write

425
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:37,089
down what the next generation after this

426
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,819
would be put it in a file netcat it back

427
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:41,770
to the port I'm done right nope because

428
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,339
when I connect back to it it says ok

429
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:48,730
here's the answer it's generating that

430
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:51,040
randomly every time ok no problem

431
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,880
I'll write the code which is obvious

432
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,469
what I was supposed to do in the first

433
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,560
place write the code that will read the

434
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:58,240
board calculate the next generation send

435
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,029
the answer back and I get my

436
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,410
congratulatory note actually I don't I

437
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:07,089
send that back and it says ok here's

438
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,949
another one I wasn't expecting that ok

439
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,619
no problem though I have all the code

440
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:12,970
I'll just put it in the loop and what

441
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:20,109
I'm trying to get people to do here is

442
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:22,420
to and so they challenge their

443
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:24,309
assumption about knowing when they first

444
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,530
start analyzing the protocol here of

445
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:29,670
what the next step is going to be and

446
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:32,320
you can sit and watch your program solve

447
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,910
one after another and the thing will

448
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,139
just keep going back and forth playing

449
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,960
with your script and all of a sudden it

450
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:43,750
throws one of these at you and then one

451
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:46,140
of those at you now am I just good to to

452
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:50,440
sleep being mean to these poor people

453
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,460
yeah no no because not only been trying

454
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,650
to get them to challenge their

455
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,050
assumptions but this is key to the whole

456
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:58,840
idea behind what ultimately are we going

457
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,760
to do if you're debugging some kind of a

458
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,889
system you're you're reverse engineering

459
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,480
whatever it is you're doing when you

460
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:08,140
first look at the behavior

461
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,790
of the system you're working with it

462
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,910
will occur to you oh I see what's going

463
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:14,770
on and you make some assumptions but

464
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,910
you'll probably be wrong the more you

465
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,639
interact with that these things are

466
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,440
constructed like odors in all kinds of

467
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,120
layers you peel a layer back there's all

468
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,970
the more complexity that gets revealed

469
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,330
the more you go and so if you go into it

470
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,970
expecting that expecting surprises and

471
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:33,580
to be able to respond to them so much

472
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,590
the better so we put together challenges

473
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,418
like these on all kinds of different

474
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,600
topics that are relevant to the kind of

475
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:42,790
work we do in security and the response

476
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,949
to that overall was pretty good people

477
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,540
said hey you know I realized this is

478
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,549
somewhat Sall selecting cuz people that

479
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,980
didn't think it was cool just didn't

480
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:52,900
play but the feedback we got was that

481
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,760
people liked it they said hey you know

482
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,169
it was a fun thing to do something that

483
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,049
I don't normally do in my job and I

484
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:01,150
learned from it but a few bits of

485
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:02,980
feedback that actually made me stop and

486
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,140
think how can we address this first of

487
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,150
all there was the issue of the wide

488
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,690
range of skills whatever we do with this

489
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:12,790
it needs to be approachable no matter

490
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,799
what your background level is the idea

491
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,110
is to to try and increase that for

492
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,809
everybody not just to cut out people who

493
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,649
either have already been there before or

494
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:23,620
aren't up to the level where the

495
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:25,480
challenge is written to other people

496
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,760
said that was fun

497
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,580
and I thought it was at a level it was

498
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,700
okay but I was kind of intimidated by

499
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,530
the idea of coming to the next week's

500
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,270
meeting and not having solved it like

501
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,889
some of the other people did or people

502
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,470
talking about it in the break room later

503
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:44,380
I want a safe place where I can sort of

504
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:46,090
privately work on these on my own and

505
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,730
then when I solved them then I can go

506
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:51,010
hey okay solve the thing and the other

507
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,590
thing was they felt like because it was

508
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:56,470
coming out an email if they weren't

509
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,120
there to start or if they needed some

510
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,530
more time they're like well if I you

511
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,459
know next week I'm gonna hear the answer

512
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,928
and I feel like you know I'm just gonna

513
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,860
not play this because it would have been

514
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:07,510
fun but that got in the way the other

515
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,979
thing that occurred to me is I'm writing

516
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,000
a lot of these challenges and it's fun

517
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,650
and all but that's not what I'm getting

518
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,510
paid for

519
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:16,780
I want to if I'm going to keep this

520
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:18,190
going in a an ongoing self-sustaining

521
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,470
way I need to incur

522
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,669
people to contribute puzzles to the

523
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,200
whole thing and make it more

524
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:24,669
collaborative and I think that's a great

525
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,320
part of the learning process too is to

526
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:28,480
get people to contribute more content to

527
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,658
what you're doing so I thought about it

528
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,059
and it's like well what kind of a game

529
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:36,370
framework would makes sense we've looked

530
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:38,039
at role-playing kinds of scenarios the

531
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,139
red team is doing that's great for them

532
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:43,929
it seemed obvious to me that a

533
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:46,000
capture-the-flag kind of framework made

534
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:47,649
the most sense there's a lot of kinds of

535
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,940
capture-the-flag games in particular I'm

536
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:50,949
talking about the with the so-called

537
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,289
Jeopardy style we have a whole

538
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,850
collection of different kinds of

539
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:57,399
challenges and different point values

540
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,529
for the difficulty levels and the person

541
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:01,479
who wants to play can come in and say I

542
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:03,090
want to do that challenge and they go

543
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,529
off and do it and they get points for it

544
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:08,470
so it's very self driven which was

545
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:11,019
important to what we were doing and this

546
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:14,259
kind of a CTF it's a little different

547
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:16,990
than a more traditional capture the flag

548
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:18,940
event or a contest where everyone comes

549
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,850
somewhere on a Saturday and they play

550
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,710
capture the flag and usually people who

551
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,230
do this a lot they go and see who's the

552
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,700
top gun and yet our team won the flag

553
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,250
and it was great and then you go home at

554
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,320
the end of the day and you're done

555
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,759
that's a very different dynamic than

556
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,200
saying we're gonna set this up and it's

557
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,889
gonna be running for 10 years and people

558
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,559
can come play when they want and I'll be

559
00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:44,559
talking not only about what that was

560
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:46,360
like for us to navigate but also some of

561
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,158
the technical details so we'll talk

562
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,740
about the people stuff and the technical

563
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,529
stuff here but that was definitely

564
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,720
something we had to to look at and along

565
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:58,090
with that people have to be able to play

566
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,789
at their own pace at their own interest

567
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,559
and and to be able to join at any time

568
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:03,429
without that being a disadvantage saying

569
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,899
well you know you guys have been doing

570
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:06,330
this for a year and I'm only starting

571
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:09,039
doesn't matter it's okay

572
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:12,129
we also wanted to address that whole

573
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:15,129
intimidation factor by not making a

574
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:16,689
leaderboard that showed everybody and

575
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:19,000
what their position was and you're being

576
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,460
put up against people that are way more

577
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,850
advanced than you so we went with a a

578
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,690
tiered kind of leaderboard that took

579
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,889
care of that and I'll show you an

580
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,889
example of in a second and

581
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,690
there's even how you set up a game like

582
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,820
this is a little more challenging than

583
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,710
an event where you can come set it up do

584
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,929
it and go home so there's some things

585
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,580
that that make the game continue to be

586
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:43,290
viable that needed to be changed from

587
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,110
what the traditional kind of method was

588
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:48,240
like this is an example of what our

589
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,840
leaderboard looks like our challenge

590
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,160
board look like looks a lot like a kind

591
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,610
of like the game show last night we have

592
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,780
a category in each column and so they

593
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,189
can pick something they want to try want

594
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,910
to try a coding challenge you go in that

595
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:05,010
first column the point values are putted

596
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,930
indication of the difficulty level so

597
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,790
you can kind of pick ones that are our

598
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:10,500
you know you can go down the list and

599
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:13,430
realize that they'll get harder as you

600
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,830
go but there's also a always a 10-point

601
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:18,960
sort of a hello world level challenge in

602
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:21,540
every single category that just confirms

603
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,190
that you are tooled up for the rest and

604
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,110
this is a category you'd probably

605
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,300
successful for it so that quick little

606
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,070
check like for instance in the code

607
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,760
challenge the holo world thing just says

608
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,929
telnet to this particular port and so

609
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,270
you do that you're telling it to the

610
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,920
port and it gives you a greeting tells

611
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,200
you what to do in this case just send

612
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,220
back a string hello server and the opre

613
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,570
but in an inhumanly short length of time

614
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,920
it's not a challenge to see if you can

615
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,960
type it's a challenge to see if you can

616
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,280
code so what we actually want people to

617
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,430
do is write a little script that will

618
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,540
interact with a tcp port a few lines of

619
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,910
code but you're going to need it for the

620
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,250
rest of the category so we have them go

621
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:01,260
through that so we'll run my script it

622
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,910
connects to the port I can see the

623
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,530
conversation going back and forth it

624
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,570
sees the greeting it sends the expected

625
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,250
response and the system says

626
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,929
congratulations that was right and

627
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:12,750
here's a flag which I can then go back

628
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:14,790
to the game and claim for my points and

629
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,310
when I do that I get put on the

630
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:18,870
leaderboard and this is what I was

631
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,419
talking about before where we did we did

632
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,560
two things we made it a tiered

633
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,660
leaderboard so you actually have a

634
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,450
beginner intermediate and advanced level

635
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:30,240
and people are only competing score wise

636
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:32,160
against people in that same category so

637
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,140
you don't have a beginner going I am

638
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,550
three hundredths on the list I'm never

639
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,290
going to get up to where these guys are

640
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,090
now they're just competing against for

641
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:43,120
the top positions for people that are

642
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:46,270
also beginners it's also not only tier

643
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,370
it's a top-5 and so people that feel

644
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:51,160
like they just want that safe space to

645
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,479
practice for a while can do that they

646
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,920
know where they are on the list because

647
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,410
it says at the top you know you are

648
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,940
number whatever but only when they reach

649
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,380
the top five in their category doesn't

650
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,750
show up so they can get some recognition

651
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,430
going hey I made the top five but they

652
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,890
don't have the intimidation of hey I'm

653
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:09,970
way below here and I can see how I'm

654
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:12,370
doing and so can everybody else now as

655
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:14,740
far as how this works inside I'll give

656
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:16,510
you a few a few details of how that

657
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,130
would actually function we have it the

658
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,540
game server setup which has its own

659
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:22,840
database that keeps the game information

660
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:25,659
and it hosts the challenge module so

661
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,030
every challenge is written into its own

662
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,740
separate module so that again we want to

663
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,450
make it so that people can collaborate

664
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,290
with us and say hey I thought I'd have

665
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,370
idea for a puzzle

666
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,639
all right write a little module for it

667
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:39,790
we just plug it in there's also a web

668
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,530
server that handles the the user

669
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,300
experience for everything but the

670
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:45,520
challenges what would typically happen

671
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,889
is you come into web browser go to the

672
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,690
challenge board pick a challenge there's

673
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:53,050
also an authentication step that happens

674
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:56,140
in the background this is as simple as

675
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:57,639
having the game maintain a list of users

676
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,130
and passwords you'd register and then

677
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,390
you could login or in our organization

678
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,610
we tied it into our single sign-on

679
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:05,260
service so that we can just go to the

680
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:09,610
website and says hi Steve let's play a

681
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:11,950
game but once you've done that then you

682
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:14,169
go off and interact with that challenge

683
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,850
module which is usually on its own TCP

684
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:18,850
port like the example I showed with the

685
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,909
game of life port it's like those so for

686
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:23,649
instance to use the life as an example

687
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:25,030
you'd select it on the board it would

688
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,360
give you in a description of what to do

689
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:29,889
and it tells you to start at port 1970

690
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,189
so you go off and do what we just saw

691
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:35,410
and as you do that you're interacting

692
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,510
directly with that challenge module and

693
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,070
it's giving you feedback along the

694
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,920
feedback along the way say nope that's

695
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:44,230
not quite right here's a new twist but

696
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,210
eventually you hit on the answer and it

697
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:49,929
says congratulations you finally got it

698
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:52,780
and here's a flag and you then go back

699
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:57,040
to the website with that flag and you

700
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:59,230
post it and claim it now in a

701
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,800
an event-based system it's pretty

702
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:05,650
typical to make these flags some kind of

703
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,720
static string but in a game that could

704
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,860
last a long time and people can play it

705
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,540
and then three years later one of their

706
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,820
colleagues sitting next to them is

707
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,560
getting frustrated I can't quite solve

708
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,149
it and have you know the person next you

709
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,000
go oh yeah well the flag for that is

710
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,440
Twilight Sparkle just type that in so we

711
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,280
need to make it so that the they were

712
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,590
dynamically generated Flags what we did

713
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,110
is made them just a random 63 bit value

714
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:30,790
which is pretty hard to guess usually

715
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:32,409
when someone solves a challenge that's

716
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,240
generated stored in a database so the

717
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:39,940
system now knows to expect it to come in

718
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:41,350
and if if a module can authenticate the

719
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,640
person which a few of them can do then

720
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,370
it can assign it directly to the person

721
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,400
but normally it's the first person that

722
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:50,949
goes and claims that can get it so a

723
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,650
64-bit number is a little inconvenient

724
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,120
and we also for various reasons had to

725
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,190
go with the design decision that says we

726
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,479
can't assume the copy and paste will

727
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,400
always work because there might even be

728
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,500
on a different computer doing the

729
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,310
challenges versus a tablet or something

730
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,290
that could be interacting with the

731
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,480
website on so thinking of all the

732
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:09,340
different ways you could represent that

733
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,170
I decided that the easiest thing if you

734
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,810
wanted to have to be able to look at a

735
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:16,210
flag and retype it was this is this is

736
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:18,639
the system used by open BSD use s key

737
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:21,040
system where to take 64 bit number and

738
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,690
gives you a short phrase of words it's

739
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,409
basically representing the number in

740
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:28,900
base 2048 so you go back to the website

741
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:31,930
you type in the flag value and it says

742
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:34,030
congratulations something else we

743
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:36,250
decided to do to give a little bit of a

744
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:39,790
recognition of people who can solve

745
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:41,560
things quickly every challenge is worth

746
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:43,899
a number of points this is worth 300

747
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,450
points but this is also worth an

748
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,130
additional 300 bonus points if you can

749
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,810
solve it within a particular length of

750
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:54,040
time so as soon as you pull up the

751
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:56,169
description that bonus point number goes

752
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,659
to 300 and starts ticking down to 99 to

753
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:00,130
98 over the course of I think in this

754
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,050
case a couple of hours and if you can

755
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:05,200
solve it in within that time then you

756
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:07,810
get some bonus points too if not it's

757
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,280
always worth at least the base point

758
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,480
value we never wanted to make it so that

759
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,200
if you weren't fast enough

760
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,900
it wasn't worth doing anymore and when

761
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,390
you go back to the challenge board the

762
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,770
having solved the challenge the score

763
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,540
you actually got including your bonus

764
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:27,850
points is now shown so you can see at a

765
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:29,918
glance where your score came from so a

766
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:32,949
lot of this hinges around talking to

767
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,870
these modules and here's where we hit

768
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,540
another challenge we wanted to make them

769
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:38,889
so you could plug them into the system

770
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,990
we wanted to make it so that you didn't

771
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,600
have to trust the code in them very much

772
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,070
and especially because again I don't get

773
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,500
paid to do this and so I need to make

774
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,668
sure that I can collaborate easily with

775
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,049
other people we need to make it so that

776
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:52,090
it's really easy for somebody to write a

777
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:56,049
challenge module without having to know

778
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,760
the CTF framework at all and so to add a

779
00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:59,620
module it shouldn't have to know how to

780
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,169
generate flags or anything like that so

781
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:04,959
very simply what what it is is when a

782
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:07,780
player connects to that TCP port that

783
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,000
host challenge the system will launch

784
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,370
part of the CTF framework called the

785
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,500
generic module launcher it launches the

786
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,000
challenge module and arranges for the

787
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,040
players connection to be on it's

788
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,090
standard input and standard output so

789
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,460
from the point of view of the person

790
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,990
writing the module for a challenge it's

791
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,090
really easy you write a piece of code

792
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,710
that just talks to the user in the

793
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:30,159
normal way on standard and standard out

794
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,870
and that's it this six line bash script

795
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,429
is a perfectly valid challenge module

796
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:35,620
not a very interesting one but it works

797
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:38,350
it all it has to do is interact with the

798
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:40,149
user when it exits back to the launcher

799
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,649
the launcher says oh the module exited

800
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:44,260
so I guess they didn't get the challenge

801
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:46,450
right and it bothers or it goes through

802
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,280
the trouble of telling the user that

803
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:51,220
they didn't get it right sorry

804
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,290
breaks the connection off if they solve

805
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,390
the challenge all the module has to do

806
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:58,059
is just exit with a particular return

807
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:00,490
value back to the caller that's all it

808
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:02,889
needs to know it then says ah good it

809
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:05,820
congratulate user generates a flag hands

810
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:08,169
it to them and then they can go claim it

811
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,280
the other thing is we also thought you

812
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:12,160
know for a couple of different reasons

813
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,620
we make sure that people can't connect

814
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,270
to a port and then just sit there partly

815
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,949
for reasons of keeping the challenge

816
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,480
level right and partly for reasons of

817
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,640
not wanting to tie up resources on

818
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,389
system but again we don't want to make

819
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,849
the module author have to deal with

820
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:27,199
that stuff so the launcher will wait a

821
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:31,218
little bit and then start sending

822
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,799
signals to the to the module code now if

823
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:36,259
there's a particular module that knows

824
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:38,389
it may be in for a long haul but it can

825
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:40,609
judge whether the person's making

826
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:42,139
adequate progress it can count those

827
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:44,059
signals coming in or decide when to call

828
00:31:42,139 --> 00:31:45,320
it quits but if the module has

829
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:47,899
absolutely no code to handle it

830
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,450
whatsoever the default action is for it

831
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:52,129
to simply die and so the module exits

832
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,409
and again the launcher says oh I guess

833
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:58,039
you didn't do it in time and it hangs up

834
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:59,479
and that's all Thor really was - you

835
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,859
know architectural II - making a module

836
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:03,739
so I mean it made it really easy to plug

837
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:07,158
these in now in terms of running the

838
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:10,099
game you do have to have a little bit of

839
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:12,499
expectation setting for the players but

840
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:14,989
it's surprising how far the golden rule

841
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:16,849
will get you on this and our so our

842
00:32:14,989 --> 00:32:19,369
first rule was just don't be evil we did

843
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:21,739
have to add a little bit of detail to

844
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:23,988
that over time everybody always wants to

845
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:26,149
say it's a hacking game so obviously if

846
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:28,190
i hack into it to get a flag for free

847
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:30,559
that proves I'm clever and I win right

848
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:34,249
know me so we said that's AB that's

849
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,259
explicitly not allowed and the whole

850
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:37,729
point of this is not I'm not here

851
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:40,190
talking about setting up a capture the

852
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:42,259
flag event at a hacker conference on an

853
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,389
isolated network this is something I set

854
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:46,099
up at work you might set up at school or

855
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:48,859
in any kind of organization where you

856
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:50,869
want your people in your organization

857
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:54,199
who still want to have jobs later to

858
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:56,629
interact with the system so if you

859
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,789
launch real attack tools against our

860
00:32:56,629 --> 00:33:01,759
system we have a whole department of

861
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:03,200
people with probably not enough very

862
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,200
much of a sense of humor that will come

863
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,849
talk to you I was just playing the game

864
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,159
is probably not a defense that's gonna

865
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:12,259
work so warning any of them of that

866
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,539
first and the the most important rule

867
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:15,829
was just relax don't get too stressed

868
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:17,719
about it this is not you know an

869
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:20,889
assignment it's a fun activity you can

870
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:24,019
learn from and so just have fun with it

871
00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:26,478
so having built all this up and run it

872
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:32,229
through the reaction was again really

873
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:34,489
pretty positive the I think one of the

874
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:36,980
one of the things that the signals the

875
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:38,600
success of a of an application is

876
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,309
if it's put to some purpose that the

877
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,250
programmer never thought of when they

878
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:46,040
wrote it and this was the framework we

879
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:48,470
used I mentioned the the in-class labs

880
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,530
that we had for our app set class we

881
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,630
ported all those in-person labs to this

882
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:56,030
framework as modules in the capture of

883
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:58,820
the fly game so through that we had

884
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:00,410
three web applications that were written

885
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,750
to be intentionally vulnerable that

886
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,100
people could attack and do things to now

887
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,790
that presents an interesting challenge

888
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:10,219
to for a persistent game people break

889
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:11,659
stuff so they could part of those

890
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:13,129
challenges this is actually one of the

891
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:16,010
models from the CTF board but it's

892
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:18,739
representative simple database lookup

893
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:21,770
app that if you type in something that

894
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:24,040
it was an expecting boom we could trace

895
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,690
back that looks like a sequel injection

896
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,850
my goodness it is vulnerable the sequel

897
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,550
injections and the next thing people try

898
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,020
is dropping the tables and whatever now

899
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,270
when we were doing this in the live lab

900
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,418
environment we had one of the teachers

901
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:40,699
sit there babysitting the lab server

902
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:42,259
because people were going to cross write

903
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:44,600
script each other and lock up browsers

904
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,669
or trash the database we had to keep

905
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,618
fixing it if we're gonna make this be

906
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:50,629
something we can set and forget and let

907
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:53,480
run for a couple of years that can't

908
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:56,659
happen so there's a couple of approaches

909
00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:02,900
that we took for that and and they both

910
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:04,250
worked in pretty much a way that's

911
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,270
appropriate to each of that trying to

912
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:08,000
think of a good way to put this but

913
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:12,440
basically for each of the modules we use

914
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,690
one of these two approaches one is to

915
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:18,590
simulate a vulnerable app and one is to

916
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:20,660
actually sandbox it the goal of that is

917
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,490
to keep one player from interfering with

918
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,109
someone else everybody when they come

919
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:26,810
into one of these apps should always see

920
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:28,250
a pristine app that's working that

921
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,799
doesn't know that it was just broken by

922
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:32,390
somebody else playing the game if you

923
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,670
broke it though you should come back and

924
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:37,730
see the still broken version just like

925
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:41,150
you had it so one way of handling that

926
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:42,950
is to sandbox it so let's say you come

927
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,859
into the app you get your own copy of

928
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:47,689
the database your own infrastructure

929
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:49,460
some might even build a virtual machine

930
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,580
around it that's more than we did but

931
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,100
I've seen it done successfully

932
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:55,860
there's but to give you a virtualized

933
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,540
view of the app that only you see and

934
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,430
you can break it and everyone else has

935
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,900
their own virtual version the other

936
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,250
tactic we took was simply to simulate

937
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,100
the vulnerability the app wasn't

938
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:07,140
vulnerable at all but it said hey you

939
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,339
just posted this input to me hmm

940
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,299
let's see that matches these five

941
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,800
regular expressions that looks like a

942
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,660
sequel injection yeah so congratulations

943
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,040
you broke me and it gives you an

944
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,350
appropriate result that a broken app

945
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,759
would do and you get the credit and yet

946
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:29,040
the app is still there running just fine

947
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:30,300
for everybody else now I also want to

948
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,009
give you a little view of how its put

949
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,870
together behind the scenes to give an

950
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:38,430
idea of how all the moving pieces fit

951
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:40,410
together this is every box is a specific

952
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:44,339
part of the system that can be

953
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:46,319
identified we have if you're coming

954
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,850
through the web interface and that's to

955
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,550
look at the leaderboard the challenge

956
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,440
list or to interact with some of the

957
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:56,580
backend services that make all that work

958
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,320
you're coming through a particular a

959
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,420
couple of interfaces or some static

960
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,840
content but you come through the service

961
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,490
module into the API this is the core as

962
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,100
it's got developed the core of it

963
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:10,200
settled into this one library that we

964
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,259
linked a few of the core programs with

965
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,549
and so there's a path where the web

966
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,590
stuff can get through it when you go to

967
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,060
the modules they have their own path by

968
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:22,170
the so ultimately go through that one

969
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:24,870
point that arbitrates what you can do to

970
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:26,760
get to the game system local

971
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:28,680
administrators have their own stuff but

972
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,900
again it all comes through the API

973
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,000
library and what that allows us to do is

974
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,580
to consolidate all the pieces that have

975
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,680
game privileges that is can do anything

976
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,480
to manipulate the game to generate flags

977
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,520
or change scores that kind of thing

978
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,910
not all none of the modules have that

979
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,580
ability and very few of the web pieces

980
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,170
do it's able to let us administrate this

981
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,120
and keep it sane pretty well and there's

982
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,790
only two pieces that have any OS

983
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,589
privileges at all and these are wrappers

984
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,480
that then launch all the other pieces so

985
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,810
you have one that's set up for modules

986
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,610
and web interface access and the other

987
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,660
is run through pseudo which allows us to

988
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:06,299
use

989
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,950
sudu configuration files to say which

990
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:10,230
admin is allowed to do what commands and

991
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:12,660
what way to the system and we're it that

992
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,520
way and speaking of administration one

993
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:18,240
of the things that was really important

994
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,920
to us was to make it so that we could we

995
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,779
could collaborate on that too so you

996
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,089
don't have one person whose whole job is

997
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,069
to make this thing keep working and so

998
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:27,538
we wanted to make it so that adding a

999
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:29,308
challenge that the game wasn't oh yeah

1000
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:33,900
you edit these five sequel tables by

1001
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:35,730
hand but made it so that anybody with

1002
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,650
that was trusted to do it could just do

1003
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,869
it easily so they're all done with CLI

1004
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,789
commands which means it's scriptable so

1005
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:44,700
things like you'd get a report that says

1006
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:46,980
show me what the state of the the system

1007
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,598
is we have these challenges the scoring

1008
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,539
information how many times people have

1009
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:53,520
tried solving them you can get a list

1010
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:54,930
that shows you what flags have been

1011
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,490
issued which also tells you which of

1012
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,348
your challenges people are solving which

1013
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:00,538
ones they're not it's a good idea of

1014
00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:03,539
maybe what things are working for people

1015
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:05,430
and even making changes is all through

1016
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:07,950
pretty simple CLI tools so you know

1017
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:09,839
adding a category to the game adding a

1018
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:12,319
challenge to a category adding a new

1019
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:16,078
player changing their score because

1020
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:17,880
reasons cleaning up flags that were

1021
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,190
issued but never claimed by anybody

1022
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,160
stuff like that made it really easy to

1023
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:26,250
do and so what we ended up with was a

1024
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:29,930
persistence framework where people can

1025
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:33,750
add new challenges of their own the

1026
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:35,700
availability of it is suited to people's

1027
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:37,799
own schedule so no one's under pressure

1028
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:41,189
to have to get through at a particular

1029
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:43,160
speed as a variety of different levels

1030
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:46,380
for what people do for a living and

1031
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,819
where their acumen is is centered and a

1032
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,380
tiered scoring system so that they

1033
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:51,529
weren't didn't have that intimidation

1034
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,490
factor but still got recognition and

1035
00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:55,920
above all we want to encourage people to

1036
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:58,589
think about new ways of solving problems

1037
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,270
or dealing with security issues you know

1038
00:39:58,589 --> 00:40:03,569
if you have somebody they spend all day

1039
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:05,940
writing policy say they don't do

1040
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:08,579
technical work and they go through a

1041
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,720
couple these exercises and it occurs to

1042
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:11,309
them you know what we should make sure

1043
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,828
our policy covers this this and this

1044
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:15,750
thing that I've never thought of before

1045
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:17,530
it gets wheels turning in people's heads

1046
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,450
that maybe hadn't

1047
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:21,340
hadn't occurred to them and so now

1048
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,080
they're more interested in things

1049
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:28,720
they're there doing things of more value

1050
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:31,319
to organization we solved the solution

1051
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,129
replay problem with random Flags

1052
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,360
we also want to make sure that

1053
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:38,290
administrating this was simple and

1054
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:41,710
automatable talked by the sandboxing of

1055
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:44,320
all the things though that we learn and

1056
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:47,140
did the most important one was this make

1057
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,130
learning fun because it doesn't matter

1058
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:51,400
what you're doing but particularly in

1059
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:54,430
security or any really high technical

1060
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,670
topic it's really easy to be really

1061
00:40:54,430 --> 00:41:00,250
boring and and have people just not

1062
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:04,180
really want to learn a new skill but if

1063
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:05,680
you make it a fun game suddenly I can

1064
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,210
take on that challenge I can do that

1065
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,740
we had one might have noticed on on the

1066
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:15,220
challenge board there was a 1,000 point

1067
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:17,379
crypto question and I sit next to

1068
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:19,120
somebody that was spending many lunch

1069
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,310
times trying to solve that and I heard

1070
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:24,609
the cries of anguish as she was doing

1071
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:26,890
this and then one day yes like okay I

1072
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:29,290
think she solved that one and just just

1073
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:31,240
so probably if it weren't in a game

1074
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,830
format might have gone it's not worth it

1075
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,509
it's not part of my job but she you know

1076
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:36,250
persevered and they got it and it was

1077
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,630
like that was really cool I'm gonna go

1078
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,370
talk five more people into doing that

1079
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:41,770
because I went through all that pain

1080
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:44,109
they can do it too but the satisfaction

1081
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:46,680
really helped her of it so that's my

1082
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:49,680
story and I'm sticking with that

1083
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,680
question

1084
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:06,500
so multiple choice versus a set answer

1085
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:07,910
we've done both and we found the

1086
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,910
multiple choice one worked really well

1087
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:14,210
for the very top hello world kind of

1088
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:16,819
things but as we got on we found more

1089
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:19,730
that that getting them to come up with

1090
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:21,680
an answer we've actually found most of

1091
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:24,109
them were more dynamic where we're

1092
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,470
having you use a tool or write a script

1093
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:30,078
that would interact with something and

1094
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:32,000
actually diagnose it down to a specific

1095
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,109
answer you could then type in but would

1096
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,319
make sense once you'd gone through that

1097
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:35,319
process

1098
00:42:49,080 --> 00:43:08,940
ooh very good question we kept the for

1099
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,129
the bonus points we kept track of time

1100
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:14,040
absolute wall clock time no matter how

1101
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:15,660
many times they connected so if it was

1102
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,120
two hours they could you know connect

1103
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,470
forty seven times and get cutoff for

1104
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:23,060
time or whatever and that wouldn't that

1105
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:23,060
would still be accounted for

1106
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:30,480
um so my company has a process for

1107
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:33,300
releasing code as open source I'm going

1108
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,150
through that so hopefully event you know

1109
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,590
soon I'll tweet something out when when

1110
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,330
it's available so cuz I'd love for

1111
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:44,100
people to play with it and do something

1112
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:45,790
better with it than I did all right

1113
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,929
thanks very much

1114
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,929
[Applause]

1115
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:56,910
you
