hopefully we won't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that so we're</font>

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,040
here to talk about iOS cripta and why

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,350
it's important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> why are we even</font>

thinking about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> well a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

ago with now almost seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ancient</font>

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,339
history Apple made a very public stance

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,930
where they said we like your<font color="#CCCCCC"> privacy we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">value your privacy they made some</font>

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,629
where they talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in great</font>

they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing why they think it's</font>

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,039
important and it had some lines in there

25
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,500
that raised a lot of questions things

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,329
like we can't bypass your passcode it's

27
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,850
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> technically feasible anymore to</font>

respond to warrants this got a lot of

29
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">people kind of upset started asking lots</font>

30

of questions things like what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really mean what about forensic attacks</font>

32
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:11,100
and this interesting because this wasn't

33
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,189
really the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was starting</font>

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,280
to hit the popular press in May<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 2013</font>

35
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,658
so almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> 18 months before Apple had</font>

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,759
even said that seeing I had an article

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how Apple was deluge by police</font>

38
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,400
demands because and they were even

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming forth with stories and ideas and</font>

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,340
anecdotes and things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't really</font>

41
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,259
supportive as a court Apple wasn't

42
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,090
talking about it but they talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

43
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,950
there being a big backlog of cases up to

44
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,420
even seven weeks well in case took four

45
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,740
months to work on and then you know the

46
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,970
this even went into there's a case in

47
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,500
Kentucky there's all the cases been

48
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,020
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in New York one of us just got</font>

kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases of</font>

52
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,040
issues where people are talking about

53
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,450
apples incomes but they were never

54
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,570
really clear about what they could or

55
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,210
couldn't do the fact that all these

56
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,679
articles<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a backlog makes you</font>

57
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,300
sort of think okay well obviously

58
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,560
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> magic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just simply</font>

59
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,080
plug your phone in something and boom

60
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,170
they got all the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could brute</font>

61
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,820
force to passwords okay well<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font>

62
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,350
that rapes they can afford an awful lot

63
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,420
of GPU crackers certainly they can make

64
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,209
it bill quickly it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work that way</font>

65
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,309
and that's why I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is</font>

66
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:22,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">how does it actually work why can't you</font>

67
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:25,910
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> a passcode offline and lots of the</font>

68
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,130
details hi what's encryption is very

69
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,209
complex but it's also fairly

70
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,299
straightforward and it's very

71
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,980
comprehensive some early details are

72
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,090
figured out<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time ago by researchers</font>

73
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,690
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good taught that I'll</font>

was at a hack in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Box answer him</font>

76
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,649
perhaps I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't remember anyway it's in</font>

77
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,330
the notes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dreaming they publish an</font>

78
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,780
awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good details way back</font>

79
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,040
for iOS four<font color="#CCCCCC"> did you know they did this</font>

80
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,630
bike you know reverse engineering

81
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,690
breaking some stuff looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to published</font>

82
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,769
api's and then in May 2012<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple kind of</font>

83
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,150
put their cards on the table and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

84
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,970
started publishing an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iowa security</font>

85
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,890
white paper which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fantastic</font>

86
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,390
document it doesn't go into code level

87
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,880
detail but it gives very good

88
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,760
information about how encryption works

89
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,519
Apple pay touch ID all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

90
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,980
information all about the deep guts and

91
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,459
security on iOS devices so definitely

92
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">check those out of you like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff</font>

93
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:26,980
so let's talk about interruption that's

94
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:28,910
iOS encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next slide</font>

95
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,488
originally when the iphones came out the

96
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">first couple iphones didn't have much</font>

97
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,480
data protection on they there was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

98
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,640
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple to get data off of them</font>

99
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">people were making fun of it you could</font>

100
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,859
hook it up to USB and stop all kinds of

101
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:45,730
information on hood in iphone 3gs they

102
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,380
added a dedicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> aes coprocessor</font>

103
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,290
located directly between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU in disk</font>

104
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think it's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the system on a</font>

105
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,730
chip and so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't get data</font>

106
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:00,649
in or out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the CP without it going</font>

107
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:02,090
through this encryption step and they

108
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,299
generate a random key they call it the

109
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,670
EMF key and that key is then encrypted

110
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:10,100
using another key now let's play

111
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Melissa's to go through and then stored</font>

112
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,310
in a special area and this this key is

113
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:19,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to encrypt the disk I've seen</font>

114
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:21,589
conflicting conflicting documentation on

115
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,330
this one sometimes I've seen it say it

116
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,250
encrypts the whole disk as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk</font>

117
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,050
sometimes I've seen where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it says it</font>

118
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,130
just encrypts the<font color="#CCCCCC"> filesystem metadata so</font>

119
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,440
it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be possible to read out the</font>

120
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,850
file system structure but you can

121
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,680
actually beat into the inodes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

122
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,970
sure which is which I haven't actually

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,060
the book that you look at the data to

124
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,320
see but the basic of<font color="#E5E5E5"> produce</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

125
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,500
here you're basically encrypting the

126
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,210
desk so again there's this UID which is

127

burned in the heart rates<font color="#E5E5E5"> further the</font>

130
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,450
manufactured or perhaps when it first

131
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:55,219
powers up it might create a random

132

do go play<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lottery that is then used</font>

138
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,690
to encrypt a consistent string I

139
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,030
remember what the strings are but

140
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font>

141
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,559
there's different strings like all ones

142
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:21,030
or just you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fixed string is</font>

143
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,730
encrypted to create this key 8 9<font color="#E5E5E5"> B then</font>

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,500
you create and random password the EMF

145
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,680
password encrypted with a 9v and store

146
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,600
them what's called a fable storage and

147
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,620
then that key is what's used to encrypt

148
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,720
the partition the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage of this</font>

149
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,520
is a fast flight when that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is</font>

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,930
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple has said is the main reason</font>

151
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,919
to even created in the first place was

152
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,410
so that you could wipe the device

153
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,940
instantly if you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to turn</font>

154
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,620
over a computer or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

155
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> give it to somebody else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't feel like taking the hard drive</font>

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,260
out in smashing with a sledgehammer you

158
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,250
would do a disk wife that that can take

159
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,780
a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go through the whole</font>

160
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,640
disk on all the files and describe

161
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,650
everything with this is literally just

162
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,090
erase a key and it just is basically

163
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,370
wiped I mean the data is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

164
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:07,500
it's encrypted with 256-bit AES so it's

165
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:09,000
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as we know today unaccessible it</font>

166
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means that you can't directly</font>

167
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,480
modify the data on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device on the</font>

168
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,120
chip so you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply you know</font>

169
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,520
pull the chip out put something<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it</font>

170
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">and write to the memory or a temple that</font>

00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,510
some limitations though as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

174
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,830
get into the system you've got access to

175
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,420
anything because it's basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

176
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,950
transparent full disk encryption there's

177
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,320
no password attached to it or anything

178
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,450
like that it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of ties a device</font>

179
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:38,790
to the memory and gives you that fast

180
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:39,780
flight capability so in iOS for the next

181
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,960
year they<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduced the Data Protection</font>

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">API and what this does is for every</font>

183
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">single file they create a random file</font>

184
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:52,289
key and then encrypt the file with that

185
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,810
key<font color="#CCCCCC"> or yes and then that file key is</font>

186
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,490
itself encrypted with a class key so all

187
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,680
the files<font color="#E5E5E5"> are encrypted with their own</font>

189
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,550
encrypted with sort of a global team

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,400
that you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them get to the</font>

files again<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of user with a diagram</font>

192
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,620
you have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> data file and then inside</font>

193
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,169
the data file you know there's

194
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,880
there's actual data of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the file the file</font>

195
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:19,010
data is encrypted by the file key the

file keys included by a class and there

197
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:24,889
are multiple classes there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll start</font>

200
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,990
there's no additional encryption the

201
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,360
only encryption that's on the file is

202
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,120
what's provided as byproduct of the full

203
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,940
disk encryption complete and less open

204
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,150
as a special mode where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

205
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,760
locked except when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you can</font>

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have a it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated there's</font>

207
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,260
actually an asymmetric key that's used

208
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,639
so you can write<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the file when the</font>

209
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,889
device is locked so if you're like

210
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,030
downloading something<font color="#CCCCCC"> large of the net</font>

211
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,530
and you want to be able to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

212
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,419
secure when it's finished downloading

213
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,190
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this and be confident than</font>

214
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,139
when the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> locks it can still write</font>

215
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,530
to the file but somebody couldn't read

216
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:05,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">it there's complete until first user</font>

217
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,690
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically what that</font>

218
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,590
means is all those files are encrypted

219
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,510
well they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all encrypted but all those</font>

220
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">files are unavailable after reboot until</font>

221
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,010
the first time you unlock the phone so

222
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,570
the class key to decrypt those is not

223
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,880
available in memory once you reboot the

224
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,590
phone once you've unlocked at once then

225
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,360
that class keys available and you can

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep on keep reading that file even with</font>

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,830
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> device is locked and then there's</font>

228
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system complete which means</font>

229
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,520
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as you lock the device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

230
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,549
file is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no longer accessible the class</font>

231
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,069
keep the decrypt complete file system

232
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:39,049
protection complete files that class key

233
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,890
is dropped from memories<font color="#E5E5E5"> uzumaki nuclear</font>

234
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:45,380
device now the default encryption when

235
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,939
in iOS four through six was no

236
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,890
protection so if you have an application

237
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,540
you write a file to disk it's just

238
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,029
written out just normal playing new

239
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,980
additional protection starting with Iowa

240
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:57,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">7 through the present day it's complete</font>

241
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,660
until first authentication so now if you

242
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:02,630
write an application we save data to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

243
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">disk as soon as that device is rebooted</font>

244
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,540
your data won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be readable until the</font>

245
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,389
user unlocked

246
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,219
the phone at least once and applications

247
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:11,060
can add further encryption to that they

248
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,089
can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to file protection</font>

249
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:17,329
complete I think the reason Apple chose

250
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,649
this mode as the default is because

251
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:20,540
there are some applications that might

252
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,709
receive updates in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> background things</font>

253
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,329
like that they might need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write to</font>

254
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,189
stuff and if they're chosen the fall

255
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,359
protection complete by default that's

256
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,339
not going to work it's just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font>

257
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,899
some issues to<font color="#E5E5E5"> developers to try and</font>

258
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:31,940
parse out problems with that so they

259
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:34,100
chose sort of a middle ground compromise

260
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,209
just for the ease of limitation to the

261
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:40,670
technique and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then most system apps up</font>

262
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:43,399
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iowa</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up till including Iowa 7</font>

263
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:46,099
used none so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data that even</font>

264
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,750
though apple applications going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

265
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">same thing they still wrote to Desmond</font>

266
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,449
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually the default protection of</font>

267
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:57,050
none so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the different class</font>

268
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:58,339
keys so again you've got files with file

269
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,560
keys that are captured by<font color="#E5E5E5"> class keys</font>

270
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:02,000
there's multiple classes you saw the<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

271
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,290
file protection complete or<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

272
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
production classes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous slide</font>

273
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,599
there's a similar number of protections

274
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,819
for keychain islands protecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> so first</font>

275
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,579
authentication protect always things

276
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:16,130
like that and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example that's why if</font>

277
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:18,529
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> remove the phone it can't connect to</font>

278
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,850
your Wi-Fi because the keychain entry

279
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:22,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> contains the password for the Wi-Fi</font>

280
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:25,069
is encrypted with complete until first

281
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,300
unlock once you've unlocked it then you

282
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:28,250
can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you can connect to the Wi-Fi</font>

283
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,839
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock the device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again and you</font>

284
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,790
leave the house<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you come back and</font>

285
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's still locked it can still read that</font>

286
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,279
key because you haven't repeated the

287
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,279

288
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:44,290
so the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> protection none there's also</font>

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,699
the class<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 or Class D and basically</font>

290
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,980
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens is it generates a random</font>

the disk encryption key and the default

00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:09,939

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom is the key back so each class</font>

304
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:21,430

305
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,019
remember before we had the file is

306
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,779

00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:44,079
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some of that a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

315
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:46,899
in another slide so now where it got the

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,490
the only way that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create the</font>

327
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,970
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why you can't take the password</font>

328
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:16,839
offline and try and crack it on a GPU

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,889
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is the four character</font>

339
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:38,300
password four-digit passcode would take

340
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,889
about 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to brute force and</font>

341
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,250
that's been constant pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> since</font>

342
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:45,370
they've done this on the a7 chips and

343
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,629
forward they<font color="#E5E5E5"> added a five-second delay</font>

344
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,250
which we believe is implemented into

345
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:50,779
secure on plate which again will discuss

346
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,129
later we're not a hundred percent

347
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:54,290
positive how exactly that works

348
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:55,670
sometimes as i said the iOS security got

349
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,439
mcnabb overrides it's really good

350
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:01,128
sometimes it just gives you enough to

351
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:03,500
ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for one but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again the passcode</font>

352
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:05,120
depends on the key derived from the past

353
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,470
which depends on the UID so you can't

354
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,610
pull it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your phone you can't crack</font>

the five-second delay that they've added

now means x about 62 which is great

far as I understand those are part of

the UI so really what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening is the</font>

a little bit of control over how this

really wipes you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

gives the code to the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it says</font>

perfect it's not perfect there are still

509
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,330
obviously the potential for bugs in the

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,879
forensics tools can get a certain

512
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:37,080
amounts of data special things can do a

513
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,400
boot level and then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

514
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,189
just skip the phone and go straight to

<font color="#E5E5E5">the cloud so we'll talk about all these</font>

like that it will let you get into it

570
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:34,700
when the phone is locked there's much

571
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,020
much less surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you to attack what</font>

572
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,970
about bucks this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I</font>

573
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,320
was here about is people say well look

574
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,820
at that lock screen bypass it just

575
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,379
showed up you can you can do this phase

576
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,290
ii thing and call Siri<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now you can</font>

577
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,910
you can read their contacts well<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

578
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,960
what your lock screen bypasses are doing

579
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:49,880
is they're moving from one apt to

580
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,400
another you're not actually unlocking

581
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,250
the phone the crypto is still in place

582
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,490
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still locked per se but instead of</font>

583
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:00,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">running instead of displaying the lock</font>

584
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,540
screen app now you're just pointing the

585
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,800
contacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> Africa's flying the message is</font>

586
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so certain things you can bounce</font>

587
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">back and forth between there and that's</font>

588
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,330
by design on

589
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,010
Oh iOS now you can swipe up from the

590
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,139
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the camera so you can one</font>

591
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,940
different apps while<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lock screen is</font>

00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">in place these bypasses just sometimes</font>

593
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,630
let you go a little bit deeper into

594
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:20,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">those apps but you're still limited in</font>

595
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,350
what data you can see the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see</font>

596
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,680
still has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be available when the</font>

597
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,179
device is locked and so if you even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

598
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,800
you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to a springboard and are</font>

599
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,480
able to watch another app which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

600
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's been a lot of strange</font>

601
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,460
ability to do that yet even if you could

602
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,660
if that abused file protection complete

603
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,940
wouldn't be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read any of that day</font>

604
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:42,120
to either and then of course these are

605
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,650
usually fixed pretty quickly by there's

606
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,209
also the potential for malicious apps

607

either<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from the App</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Store which</font>

sometimes sneak by or nowadays you're

609
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,990
seeing a lot more people sideloading

610
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,350
apps they find ways to get cracked apps

611
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,640
and wrap it with an enterprise cert to

612

install<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your phone you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need the</font>

app store sometimes those can have bugs

00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:05,190
in them or exploits of that attack bugs

615
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,928
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the potential for</font>

that are good<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are hard to</font>

00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">but ultimately if you have a lock device</font>

636
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,460
these tools still face the same

obstacles that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I will if the</font>

get

it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlock device then yeah there</font>

642
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,470
are some hidden or<font color="#E5E5E5"> little-understood</font>

643
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,169
features that allow you to get certain

644
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,490
access from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device and once they can</font>

645
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,710
get certain databases they can pull off

646
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:08,030
all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things all kinds of photo</font>

647
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,380
information things that you think are

648
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,510
deleted but are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> cottage it's still</font>

649
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,860
hidden and system databases stuff like

650
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,170
that so there is a treasure trove of

651
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,729
information when the device is unlocked

652
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:21,890
when it's locked there's very little

653
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:24,080
that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get off and then booting a</font>

654

new OS you know a regular computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

656
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,850
coming off of that or a cd-rom or

657
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,730
something like that community different

658

OS now you can attack the<font color="#CCCCCC"> filesystem the</font>

659
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,900
way that boots work on iOS devices that

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,550
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple stages there's the</font>

661
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,040
low-level boot which starts off<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

662
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:42,169
stored in the boot rom that starts up

663
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,670
another process called I boo and it

664
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,200
checks the signature before it starts it

665
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,840
so the signature of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye boot image</font>

666
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,910
doesn't match an appropriate signature

667
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:56,389
with a see a chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

food runs it loads the colonel and

670
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,020
actually boots the US and does it

671
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,230
similar signature tracks and the OS

672
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,450
image when you install<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from apple so</font>

673
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,250
if you download an update the operating

674
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,200
system image is also encrypted using a

675
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,850
key that's unique to each kind of device

676
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,220
it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the GID keep it just like</font>

677
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,469
you ID it's burned into the silicon when

678
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,470
they broke when they create a device so

679
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:23,630
if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> G ideas</font>

680
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,310
for an iphone 6 then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can decrypt</font>

681
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,630
iphone 6 firmwares but if you can't get

682
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:31,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that code that you can't decrypt that</font>

683
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:33,500
from where and then there were some bugs

684
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,450
on early devices they fixed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

685
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,090
iphone 4s but up until iphone 4 might

686
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,890
have one there was a bug in the boot rom

687
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,290
that allowed you to boot an untrusted

688
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:44,330
unsigned damage basically there was just

689
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,879
a way to screw with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature</font>

690
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,399
validation process and skip

691
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,980
you can do and that's how we were able

692
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">to in the past boot off an external</font>

693
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">limit get to a shell and actually run</font>

695
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,720
that hasn't worked since I can never

696
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,320
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the years are but four or</font>

five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and then of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

698
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,540
there's the cloud many apps never had

699
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,480
server-side data components most of the

700
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:12,520
apps<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> check for my job most of the</font>

data is on line is very most frequently

702
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,270
they're just very thin veneers of apps a

703
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:19,000
lot of times it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a web app sort of</font>

704
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:22,000
been a windowing an application and all

705
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,190
the data stored up on a server recently

706
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,810
Apple started providing some basic app

707
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,010
data storage for free so if you're a

708
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,840
developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you haven't have you have</font>

709
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:30,850
a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of data that you're</font>

710
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,760
acting just store an iCloud for no cost

711
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:35,110

their own back-end service that they

753
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:03,209
that phone trusts your computer you can

754
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,620
get at the data and iOS 8 i believe it

755
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,730
was they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed a lot of these</font>

756
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,928
holes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't simply use these</font>

757
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,340
free or low-cost software it was like

758
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:13,950
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i explored and stuff like</font>

759
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,418
that you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use those to navigate the</font>

760
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,399
whole file system you can only navigate

761
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:19,470
to certain folders on certain

762
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:23,459
applications which is great for users

763
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:26,549
lousy for me that's where it and then

764
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,230
mobile device management MDM if a phone

765
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:29,850
is are enrolled and configured

766
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,799
appropriately you can unlock a device

767
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,510
remotely you can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a signal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>

768
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,600
MDM server to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and season it</font>

769
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:38,340
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unlocks it actually wipes</font>

770
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,080
the key out so now the key bag is is

771
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:44,189
wide open and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can no longer</font>

772
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,510
lock it with password but to do that you

773
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,159
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to talk to the</font>

774
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,470
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device you need Wi-Fi or cellular</font>

775
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,750
access if the phone's been rebooted

776
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:54,809
there's no Wi-Fi if the phone doesn't

777
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:56,220
have a data plan activated then there's

778
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:58,350
no cellular data and you can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it</font>

779
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:01,409
so it's an ipod touch or ipad without

780
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:04,769
cellular data then again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can access</font>

781
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:06,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">it on mdf so it's a great way to do it</font>

782
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:07,649
if you've got access to it but you have

783
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:13,139
to have an active network connection in

784
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:16,580
order to disseminate so that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

785
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:20,039
got to where we are now it's been

786
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting a lot more attention lately this</font>

787
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,970
used to be pretty arcane pretty much of

788
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,039
interest to the geeks like those people

789
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the security community why is this</font>

790
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,879
been a big big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal now since it's been</font>

791
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,928
so stable since iOS four and really

792
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,010
there's three things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have been</font>

793
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:34,169
changing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last couple of years</font>

794
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:36,960
some changes the software into hardware

795
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:39,779
and a very public changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> too there's</font>

796
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,460
their policy on privacy and a lot of

797
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:42,210
this was probably driven by<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of what</font>

798
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:47,070
happened

799
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:49,370
Snowden revelations so when iOS 7 I

800
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:54,929
mentioned before that the defaults for

801
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:56,429
applications was none and then starting

802
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,650
with Iowa<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 the third-party absolute</font>

803
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,840
complete until first unlock starting

804
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:02,880
with iOS 8 moving forward all default

805
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,709
rates all apps are now defaulting to

806
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,200
first unlock for the system as well as

807
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">for third-party generated apps which</font>

808
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,990
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most data on the system is</font>

809
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,870
not going to be readable immediately

810
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:15,870
after you reboot the phone and that

811
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,729
becomes important in a little while they

812
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,199
also limited the sandbox access over USB

813
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,790
that's what I was just saying about even

814
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,670
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trusted computer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over USB you</font>

816
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:31,820
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the software changes that came</font>

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last between 2014-2015 and</font>

there's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to just to</font>

819
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,630
demonstrate this for yourself even if

you had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iowa</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 phone still at the</font>

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,010
can reboot call yourself from a landline

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd see your contact information</font>

825
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,700
show up that your name maybe your

826

picture stuff like that with an iOS 8 or

9 phone after a fresh reboot when you

828
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,220
call it you just see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone number no</font>

database is open call again and you'll

832

see the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of the</font>

834
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,990
ever wonder why sometimes they see<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

835
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:05,250
phone number and sometimes you see it

836
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:10,020
because you probably just rebooted the

837
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:13,920
phone and then they added some hardware

in black hat with summer that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

875
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:35,129
that see what they say and then finally

876
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's the Apple drawing the line of</font>

877
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:39,209
this and I came right<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and said very</font>

878
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:41,129
clearly we sell products and not your

00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:45,988
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually pages up there which</font>

882
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:47,908
gives some pretty good technical advice

883
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:50,389
for security choices talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

888
00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:02,309
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally they also promised</font>

889
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:05,190
additional transparency about government

890
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:09,629
access so all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things lead us to</font>

891
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:11,549
where we are today we've had a gradual

892
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:16,168
security of improvement improvements and

893
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:18,749
security over a number of years then we

894
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:20,970
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> Snowden saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go vote the</font>

may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> true I'm not going</font>

897
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:27,639
to that but stone happened everybody got

898
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:29,379
upset and it really started<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

899
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:31,958
focus on this which is good focus is

900
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:33,070
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple do their line in the sand</font>

901
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:35,289
saying that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are committed to your</font>

902
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy we started to see some public</font>

903
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:39,789
pushback publican<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I presume private</font>

904
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:41,739
pushback from law enforcement then there

905
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:44,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">was the attack in San Bernardino and FBI</font>

906
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:46,839
requesting the court to make apple

907
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:48,729
unlock the phone and that led us to

908
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,609
where I was in New<font color="#E5E5E5"> York the other day</font>

909
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:52,599
and somebody found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was having</font>

910
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:54,549
sitting in the tables<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean found out</font>

911
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:55,718
we was chatting with me found out<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font>

912
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:56,679
worked in security one of the first

913
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:58,779
thing they said is what do you think

914
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,549
about the FBI Apple think so complete

915
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:01,899
stranger asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> me about this and I</font>

916
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:03,399
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was fantastic even better</font>

917
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:08,289
they were squarely on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of Apple</font>

918
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:09,579
so I was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to see that so what</font>

919
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:11,049
FBI asked for and everybody here

920
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:14,379
probably knows a lot like this but just

921
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:16,869
recap FBI<font color="#CCCCCC"> had asked for a way to bypass</font>

922
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:17,769
the passcode guessing friends so they

923
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,059
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to take the phone and</font>

924
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:22,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cassandra passcodes over and over and</font>

925
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:23,918
over again<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to root for sit in</font>

926
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:25,179
order to do that the order was from the

927
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,529
court was specifically asking for a

928
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:29,529
custom versioning operating system

929
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:32,799
tailored to just this phone was it

930
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:34,839
possible to do this probably I mean like

931
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said we were doing this as hackers for</font>

932
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:38,559
years using the older phones with

933
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,178
bootrom bug there's no reason to believe

934
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Apple didn't have the capability</font>

935
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:44,559
technically to do this but apple<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

936
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:46,299
spent nearly a hundred pages and court

937
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,609
responses detailing why it was a bad

938
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:51,039
idea they made a pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument I</font>

939
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:53,168
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> then eventually the FBI said yeah</font>

940
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,440
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need you we hired somebody to</font>

941
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:59,919
do before us and we're good so how did

942
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,479
they finally get in don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we've</font>

943
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,070
talked a lot of possibilities and

944
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:04,389
certainly everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the blogosphere</font>

945
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:06,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twittersphere and everywhere else</font>

946
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:07,899
at CNN they throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out ideas and oh</font>

947
00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:09,668
this company is doing oh no<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

948
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:12,399
company or cos 2 million dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody</font>

949
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:16,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">really knows there's some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good ideas or</font>

950
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,440
some crazy ideas what we do know is that

951
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,819
there are definitely some attack

952
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,940
surfaces that's still present in the

953
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:23,558
film obviously the whole system depends

954
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,909
on cryptography its extensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

955
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:25,860
comprehensiveness through every bit of

956
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:28,810
the phone

957
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:32,050
all the security basically assumes that

958
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:34,299
that's safe and then there's hardware

959
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,250
taxi ultimately if you can hold it you

960
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,250
can own it there's there's nothing that

961
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can do to prevent that effect the</font>

962
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:43,000
question is how much do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

963
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:44,620
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the the deep hardware</font>

964
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,080
attacks are possible but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can be</font>

965
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,370
expensive and risky and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally of</font>

966
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,440
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> your software bugs they happen to</font>

967
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:52,630
everybody they happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot every every</font>

968
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,490
iOS update there is some weird bug that

969
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,720
goes up lock screen bypasses or there's

970
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:59,049
been a couple that actually let you

971
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:00,370
interrupt the passcode process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

972
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:04,000
actually describe this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for getting</font>

973
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:06,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">into myself so cryptographic attacks if</font>

974
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,290
you want to boot a hacked image so again

975
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,000
boot off an external disk so you can

976
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,400
actually run brute force passcode and

977
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,720
cracking on the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> break</font>

978
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,030
into apple and steal their secret key so

979
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,040
now you can sign your own image that's

980
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,930
the best way to do it we don't know how

981
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,460
they store those secret keys the Iowa

982
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:24,040
security document mentions that the use

983
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:26,230
tamper-resistant h SMS for the private

984
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,720
keys for certain other facilities

985
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:30,100
certain other capabilities pretty

986
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,390
reasonable to assume that the signing

987
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,040
key for their OS and their<font color="#E5E5E5"> most popular</font>

988
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,779

able to do that I would hope you could

991
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,470
break the signature process you can

992
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,870
break RSA you could break sha-1 you can

find a boot rom bug<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the first two</font>

there but also we know that that's kind

00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,150
there's one there we're not seeing

999
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,529
obviously the jailbreak community isn't

1000
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,880
perfect but they're probably look pretty

1001
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:04,030
hard with every new device to see if

1002
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,170
there's any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of way around that and</font>

1003
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:07,480
then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's the possibility</font>

1004
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,070
of a complete cryptographic breaking IES

1005
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,950
which would allow you to either derive

1006
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:14,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UID and thus assign you know starter</font>

00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:17,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll find out or just allow you to</font>

1008
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:20,149
directly read the files anything that

1009
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,529
would obviously be very

1010
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:25,049
there are some hardware attacks you

1011
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:26,669
could take the system on a chip take off

1012

the top scan it take off a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

1013
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:30,808

1014
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:33,630

rays eventually find where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> uid is</font>

1016
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:38,130
stored and directly extracted so now you

1017
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:40,049
need this code that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the code now</font>

1019
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:44,939
onto normal computer and then you brute

00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:46,619
force the password on GPU cluster it's

<font color="#E5E5E5">possible it's also risky too expensive</font>

1023
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:52,319
your laser is tuned a little bit too

1024
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:54,299
high or a little bit off to the side and

1025
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:57,380
wipes out view ID you're never going to

1026
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:59,729

1027
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:03,419
there's also potential for memory chip

that haven't been proven that that's

1038
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:26,609
possible it's certainly theoretically

1039
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,439
possible I think that'd be great black

1040

1044
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:40,859
race condition if at a hardware level

1045
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:42,449
there's some kind of signal made you

1046
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,130
know deliberate or inadvertent you know

1047
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:46,079
a side effect but if there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

1048
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,519
of signal that lets you know the pass

1049
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,349
code was good or the pass code was bad

1050
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,788
then you might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to shut the</font>

1051
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:52,890
device down as soon as that pass code

00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:54,840
was bad singing what was found before it

1053
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:58,020
writes it out to disk and now you

1054
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,010
just bypassed the failure count of

1055
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,320
course now you've turned in any

millisecond / try thing into a two

1057

possible you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find the</font>

same race condition and software there's

1060
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:14,880
actually a bug year or two ago where

1061
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,260
there was some kind of a visual

1062
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">indication on the screen that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

little robot<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you know what tap away</font>

1065
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,210
the things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it little Cameron one</font>

1067
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:27,840
bad password was entered the camera

1068
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,490
would discovered this little indication

1069
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,340
and immediately power the phone down

1070
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:35,479
then you power back up again so again it

1071
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:38,130
really slowed the attack process down

1072
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,930
but it avoided ever writing the failures

1073
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:41,280
out to desk so you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pack it do</font>

1074
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:45,240
it as often as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it if you have</font>

that the phone didn't have anything on

1080
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,549
it anyway if you were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a</font>

1094
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:24,210
the most likely suspects in my opinion

1095
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,680
either a boot rom bug so you can then

1096

boo to a hacked image and cracked

get you some Intel and<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be enough to</font>

that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what</font>

1102
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,380
they might be other bugs and lock

1103
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,960
screens that allow you to to intercept

1104
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,580
the pass code failure count and then of

1105
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,710
course is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the possibility for hardware</font>

actually talking about legal things

already who knows it might have happened

1173
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:16,520
some legitimate questions we just don't

1174
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,079
have answers for the docs didn't clearly

1175
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">describe where the crypto processor was</font>

1176

it moves in the system on chip or not

1177
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:23,720
I'm pretty sure it is that's kind of a

1178
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,700
silly question can the secure Enclave

1179
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,169
software be updated that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

1180
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,328
the biggest question about this is aside

1181
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,910
from booting off of secure trusted image

1182
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:34,069
could you update the image in the secure

1183
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:36,710
Enclave override the passcode

1184
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:38,390
protections and if you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1185
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,770
you do it from the back device I would

1186
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:43,308
hope you can't but we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know</font>

1192

system on a chip and then finally will

1195
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:01,670
where the passcode failure count all the

1196
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,470
passcode fill your tracking and

1197
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:06,319
everything like that are all stored in

1198
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:09,288
SE and they're all in rums we can't be

1199
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:11,450
changed by Apple and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten try limit</font>

is enforced by that wrong codes

1201
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:14,689
way to get around that if all those are

1202
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,430
true it might even be possibly be happy

1203
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:21,910
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> four-digit passcode I don't know</font>

1204
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:24,169
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there yet so the conclusion is</font>

1205
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,790
we all know Iowa security is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1206
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,410
dependent upon the encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1207
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:29,020
pervasive<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything's built upon the</font>

1208
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:31,730
presumption that that's strong and safe

1209
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:34,220
it's complicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's comprehensive as</font>

1210
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:38,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">far as I know there's no real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known</font>

1211
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:39,859
design flaws in this certainly is I

1212
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,180
haven't seen anybody say oh well if

1213
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'd done this it would be better but</font>

1214
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,569
they chose this this algorithm and so

1215
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:48,290
there's a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't seen</font>

1216
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:50,060
anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that bypass the protection</font>

1217
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:51,950
therefore depends on breaking the pass

1218
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,810
code which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do with very</font>

1219
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:56,480
expensive hardware tax you with software

1220
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:58,279
bugs that are kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> short-lived and</font>

1221
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,980
it's still a slow process especially to

1222
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a long pass code or you can just</font>

1223
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,590
break crypto in general which breaks

1224
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:05,359
everything in the world and we're

1225
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,440
complete the others and so the best

1226
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,590
thing is just to fight back on the

1227
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,330
strong pass code so I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

1228
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:13,580
references that the Iowa security paper

1229
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:15,319
they tend to update that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the fall</font>

1230
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:18,470
usually sometimes in the screen as well

1231
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">a very good paper unfortunately it's</font>

1232
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:21,589
very generically name so you'll

1233
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,800
eventually find it to be Google for it

1234
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:26,270
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> available at a flea there's</font>

1235
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">this urge any talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned back in</font>

detail about how all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> work there</font>

1239
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,870
were some of the first people to to

1240
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:38,270
publicly describe a lot of this and then

1241
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:40,940
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also a talk from elcomsoft at</font>

security papers is the canonical

1248
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,150
document the other to kind of give you

1249
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,710
some background will be more

1250
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:01,640
understanding because the paper going to

1251
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:02,869
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete so that's it thank you for</font>

1255
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:20,190

1256
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,140
the iOS kernel is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the OS and general</font>

1257
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:24,210
encrypted as well and at what point is

1258
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:26,279
does that get defensive there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:29,520
additional nuances and capabilities

data partition system partition has

1265
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,820

<font color="#CCCCCC">toonie partition is itself encrypted</font>

using a different key and that's also

1268
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:53,040
derived from the UID and so on and you

1269

had one know anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes hi so</font>

00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:17,190
Bernardino would you want this to happen

1280
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:19,529
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh what if it's a child you know yeah</font>

1281
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:22,560
Lester would you want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

1282
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:24,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a triangle and then Apple obviously</font>

1283
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,390
takes the side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> life we want to sell</font>

1284
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:29,400
the place as the technology advisor is

1285
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:30,960
there a middle ground and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by</font>

1286
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,500
that is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely not key escrow</font>

1287
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,210
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> words I mean both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them did</font>

1288
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">not work out for the governments favor</font>

1289
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,980
but is there am like a middle ground

1290
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,900
that like you can think of like a

1291
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,210
strategy or anything like that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

1292
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:49,020
like okay maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can work together</font>

1293
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:52,440
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I'm just like very own it</font>

1294
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:54,480
yeah optimistic in humanity there's got

1295
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,010
to be a way or there's got to be a

1296
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,600
solution out there to kind of find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1297
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:59,040
middle ground between<font color="#CCCCCC"> you two yeah so</font>

1298
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question for the recording</font>

1299
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,220
is on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department of Justice and FBI</font>

1300
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,379
or an apple in their own bubble each

1301
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,540
side is intransigence<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there a middle</font>

1302
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,320
ground that allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this</font>

1303
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,750
capability to protect against

1304
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,850
kidnap kids or child porn and yet not

1305
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:18,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clothes everybody else's rights and</font>

1306
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:19,990
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a middle ground and I knew</font>

1307
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:22,300
it I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be speaking contact us I'd</font>

1308
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:24,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">be making a lot of money um I don't</font>

1309
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is you mentioned key escrow</font>

1310
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,210
the u.s. code was pretty well destroyed

1311
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:30,370
with the Clipper Chip years ago and

1312
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:32,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it again and really key</font>

1313
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:34,420
escrow depends on storing<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys securely</font>

1314
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,400
and we've proven<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and again and</font>

1315
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,050
again we can't do that people will

1316
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,090
eventually break into things may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1317
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:41,920
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> HSM and stuff there there</font>

1318
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,990
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> past but I'm not confident in</font>

1319
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,880
that just based on our track work so do

1320
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:48,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think it'll be peddled policy rather</font>

1321
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,040
than technology I'd hate to see any time

1322
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:53,110
we send an apology because eventually

1323
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:55,630
policies will all default<font color="#CCCCCC"> to governments</font>

1324
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:56,980
have control so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately this may</font>

1325
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:58,600
be one of the situations<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the tech</font>

1326
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:01,660
just has to win because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the safest</font>

1327
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:03,549
approach but that's all very that's a

1328
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,770
political policy legal question that I'm

1329
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,270
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even remotely qualified to</font>

1330
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:08,680
talk about i live in my opinion which

1331
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:11,920
you can probably guess is one of the

1332
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:14,560
other side yes sir so I know being

1333
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">inconvenient</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around let's see let's see</font>

1334
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,779
that phone was running late variation of

1335
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,700
iOS 8 and Apple could say okay we can

1336
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,380
hackers but they knew what government

1337
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,740
wants out what I hacked is by then they

1338
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:28,690
can immediately release a software patch

1339
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:34,629
for that specific method that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1340
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:36,520
would that be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question that</font>

1341
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:39,670
sounds like if Apple were forced to use

1342
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,470
some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> backdoor some kind of</font>

1343
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:43,630
weakness to pass to break the fast

1344
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:46,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">governed device could they succumb to</font>

1345
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,590
the the echo as to the court order do it

1346
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:49,360
and then immediately<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue a patch to</font>

1347
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:52,150
protect everybody else it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1348
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,710
where that where that that weakness was

1349
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:58,180
you know what they were doing it the

1350
00:48:53,710 --> 00:49:00,490
weakness they exploited with some excuse

1351
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:02,649
me it was because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boot image</font>

1352
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:04,029
question then they can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really patch it</font>

1353
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,950
because they have to be able to boot if

1354
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:06,860
it was because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some other things then</font>

1355
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,839
yeah they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font>

1356
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,550
to change things and again with the

1357
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:13,610
possibilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> I raised about the secure</font>

1358
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:14,810
Enclave if the back off code timeouts

1359
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:16,960
and stuff like that are stored in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1360
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:19,570
strong thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could is modifiable</font>

1361
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,760
then yes I can see that maybe being told

1362
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:23,870
fixes your Enclave you know or abuse

1363
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">this at your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own thing so you can crack</font>

1364
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,990
the passcode and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's great</font>

1365
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:28,850
new phones now it's in wrong we can't

1366
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:30,379
change whatever that might be a path

1367
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:32,120
that will happen I don't know what they

1368
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">will or not that's kind of where I would</font>

1369
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:39,170
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it go I only think about</font>

1370
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:40,580
this part time<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there you know I</font>

1371
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe there's another system Oni</font>

1372
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:45,730
research would be about this issue maybe

1373
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,990
not explicit but the general consensus

1374
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:50,300
kind of seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> shift towards well</font>

1375
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:52,939
let's just let each<font color="#CCCCCC"> from play the role</font>

1376
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:55,760
Apple tries to secure their devices as

1377
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:57,350
much as they can and we give the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1378
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">know more resources so they can find</font>

1379
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,890
their attackers and they just try to

1380
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,820
hack it as much as I can cat<font color="#E5E5E5"> mouse yeah</font>

1381
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,620
what do you feel about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation</font>

1382
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,330
what do I feel about the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cat</font>

1383
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:08,000
and mouse<font color="#CCCCCC"> de tantas it were between</font>

1384
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:10,000
government intended and that's really

1385
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of exactly what it the way I feel</font>

1386
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,230
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are their stories may be</font>

1387
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:17,330
apocryphal<font color="#CCCCCC"> from years back of the</font>

1388
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:18,770
government getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to things like</font>

1389
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:20,390
western union and stuff like that and

1390
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:22,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll get extra copies of telegrams</font>

1391
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:23,810
certainly there is there's documented

1392
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:26,450
cases of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bridge feeling that we're</font>

1393
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:28,340
pulling stuff off of cables<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and</font>

1394
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:29,540
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always been that question of you</font>

1395
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,010
know does the company want to feel

1396
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,210
patriotic and help the country and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1397
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:34,520
kind of give these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the side</font>

1398
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:36,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">and official unofficial basis if they</font>

1399
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,060
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that that's their choice I</font>

1400
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:40,880
have no problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's for noble</font>

1401
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:42,410
cause great on the other hand in these

1402
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,090
days<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they do it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's found out</font>

1403
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:45,710
they're going to be crucified<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aurelius</font>

1404
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:47,840
so they probably don't ever ever ever

1405
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do that again even privately</font>

1406
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,160
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> my table but I think it should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1407
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,960
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-and-forth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the government</font>

1408
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,370
has their needs they do what they want

1409
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,510
to do the private industry has their

shouldn't be compelled to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>
