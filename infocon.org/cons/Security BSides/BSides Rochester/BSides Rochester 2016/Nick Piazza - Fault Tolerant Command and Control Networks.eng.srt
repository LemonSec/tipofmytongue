I'm Nick I'm gonna giving a talk and

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,500
fault-tolerant command control networks

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,210
today so here's the agenda intro and

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,099
over a little bit of thought in history

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little explanation of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> c2</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,619
little in depth<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how very common form</font>

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,250
of seats who is used and that an idea

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:27,210
for a c2 network that was inspired by

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:30,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">IRSC not using IRC but inspired off of</font>

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,149
how IRC works the goals for the project

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,059
that actually came in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my head and then a</font>

12
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a demo and then questions</font>

13
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,629
and special thanks and references so

14
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:46,320

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to hopefully do that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">coefficient again this year and do some</font>

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,990
fun stuff and i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to get into</font>

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,580
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentest stuff which is kind of why</font>

26
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,429
my head was wrapped around botnets and

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:19,110
such and this is my first talk at<font color="#CCCCCC"> akan</font>

28
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:21,750
ever let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about</font>

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,500
what's in scope basically we're going to

30
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,930
be talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> command-and-control</font>

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,060
servers how they communicate meet up

32
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,350
with each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the clients it's</font>

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,240
mainly going to focus on server to

34
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,699
server communication and just a little

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit of client check-in what's not in</font>

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,840
scope are the clients in general i'm not

37
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,220
going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> in-depth on how the clients</font>

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,340
are you managing the call that remains

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,270
not going to be managed how the clients

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be connecting to the network</font>

41
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,220
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the network is going to</font>

42
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,689
facilitate the clients also not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

43
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,399
be going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> any reverse engineering on</font>

44
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,529
clients to make sure that you don't

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,060
expose these domains in other word your

46
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,920
implant is bad and you should feel bad

47
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not something that will be covered in</font>

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,960
this talk and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to hear cool</font>

49
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,360
so a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an overview on</font>

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,770
botnets right wikipedia<font color="#E5E5E5"> States about net</font>

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,650
as a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> computers that talk</font>

52
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,199
to each other

53
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,460
long winded stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it's a whole</font>

54
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,869
bunch of computers that talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font>

55
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,730
other or servers that give them

56
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,560
information that's on things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so</font>

57
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a malicious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pot- a benign</font>

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,110
button there's the infamous azuz banking

59
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">trojan botnet which special traded tons</font>

60
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,350
and tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bank credentials and bank</font>

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,910
information and money right<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you have</font>

62
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,140
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> benign like study at</font>

63
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">home if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said he is</font>

64
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,549
it's a whole bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in South</font>

65
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,140
America I believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have big</font>

66
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,090
satellite dishes and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to</font>

67
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,190
space to see if aliens are talking and

68
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a lot of data because you got to</font>

69
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,329
process a whole bunch of signals<font color="#CCCCCC"> now no</font>

70
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,000
patterns that aren't specifically

71
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,410
developed and stuff so they outsource it

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,480
right so you can sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> studying at</font>

73
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,700
home and basically enlist yourself in a

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,679
botnet right it's for SETI it's for

75
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">science right but ultimately you're</font>

76
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,980
still in botnet you're still receiving

77
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:58,900
commands from some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of network so</font>

78
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,510
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we use a botnet for a lot of</font>

79
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,950
what we see today is four doses

80
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">denial-of-service you have a whole bunch</font>

81
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,179
of machines hammering the website and

82
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,890
bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down email spam once again</font>

83
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,360
leverage a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> machines to</font>

84
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,660
spend it send as much emails you want

85
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,180
you could use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to see torrents from</font>

86
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,260
let's say a leak so let's say you leaked

87
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,570
something like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Panama papers</font>

88
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,980
recently you've got terabytes of data

89
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're trying to get you seated out</font>

90
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,000
to all of your clients this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensures</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

91
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,920
hey these people these documents that

92
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,300
you've leaked out<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have somewhere</font>

93
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,780
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they can't be brought</font>

94
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,550
down by some sort of dmca where they go

95
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,320
and just take down the one or two

96
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers that you're seeing off of before</font>

97
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,160
it gets distributed out to everybody can

98
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,530
pass it or we see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nowadays</font>

99
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,269
botnet as a service so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you build a</font>

100
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,910
botnet you get it as big as you can and

101
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:48,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">then you just hire like hire yourself</font>

102
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,590
and have people hire you so that you can

103
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,840
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they want to do is you say</font>

104
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,780
okay we'll let you this other criminal

105
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:00,010
organization use our botnet to denial of

106
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:03,120
service to this site so just a few

107
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,230
figures one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first vomits that</font>

108
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,440
just figures from Wikipedia that they

109
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,090
listed the bagel dotnet had about

110
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,250
230,000 nodes

111
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,700
infamous<font color="#E5E5E5"> conficker that's where we see</font>

112
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,769
on ms 08 posted 4067 that's right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

113
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry this is a seven on one of those</font>

114
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:23,220
exploits there was millions and millions

115
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,630
of notes that were in that net with a

116
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,020
portion of them that were in a botnet

117
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:33,150
and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zeus malware there were</font>

118
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:35,039
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 million nodes in the US alone so</font>

119
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,570
let's get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the terms that</font>

120
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,979
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using to describe on</font>

121
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,469
that's right you've got thought master

122
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:43,590
is you two servers relay nodes BOTS and

123
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,790
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these and normally we</font>

124
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,500
have something that's organized like

125
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,479
this you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box at the bottom</font>

126
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,639
relay nodes in the middle C<font color="#CCCCCC"> two servers</font>

127
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,900
right there and then up at the top we've

128
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,680
got the master<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

129
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,750
into these from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground up so we're</font>

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bots right the</font>

131
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,020
bots or zombies as they're sometimes

132
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">called is the malware that you have</font>

133
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,340
installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the target it's sitting on</font>

134
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,050
the target waiting calling back getting

135
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,049
your instructions and executing whatever

136
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,000
you want it checks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a dos</font>

137
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,880
command for this for X amount of time

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,460
get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> command perform it wait check</font>

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">in wait check it ideally you're going to</font>

140
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,000
have a lot of them because what<font color="#CCCCCC"> does a</font>

141
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,780
botnet if you only have two two nodes

142
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,130
you're not going to get too much

143
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">accomplished with two notes out in the</font>

144
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,760
wild<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ultimately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's to execute the</font>

145
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:29,909
commands that's given by the sea to

146
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,610
servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> see two stands for command and</font>

147
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,660
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't make that so we're</font>

148
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to move on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the relay nodes</font>

149
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,120
right so the relay nodes are for

150
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,340
forwarding connections from the bots to

151
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,620
the servers ideally you don't want to

152
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,539
expose<font color="#E5E5E5"> your servers because if you only</font>

153
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,340
have a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them like this diagram</font>

154
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:49,320
shows we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say three servers in</font>

155
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,460
this network the bottom master looks

156
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,139
like it's updating each of those

157
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,599
individually you really don't want to

158
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,700
lose those<font color="#E5E5E5"> right see two servers are</font>

159
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:57,900
kind of like your crown jewels you don't

160
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,630
want to lose them so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend up a</font>

161
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,849
whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of relay nodes that</font>

162
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,760
facilitate communications from the bots

163
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:09,840
to the servers this could be as simple

164
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,680
as simple as like a socks proxy or like

165
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,590
netcat forwarding listening on

166
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,430
for forwarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out the other and just</font>

167
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,190
facilitate facilitating<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

168
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,289
communication or it could be as complex

169
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,850
as rotating through hundreds and

170
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:24,370
hundreds of domains or having a domain

171
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:26,020
generation algorithm that the attacker

172
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,699
is going to register certain domains

173
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,820
that are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to those</font>

174
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:32,500
servers and this is the layer in the

175
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,120
traditional model that you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

176
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,539
fault-tolerant right you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

177
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,400
lot of these so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you lose 50 of</font>

178
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:42,490
these relay nodes you still have a

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,409
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them left and the malware or</font>

180
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,120
the bots still know how to get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

181
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:51,039
layer of relay nodes which know how to

182
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:53,680
get the sea to server layer so under the

183
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,560
sea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to servers so these are going to be</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">holding all the commands it's going to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have a real I know network setup it'll</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this idea of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> commanding control channels</font>

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">commands so let's say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have one set</font>

195
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,099
of relay nodes that says to call back

196
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,020
over HTTP and it downloads a an HTML

197
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,659
file parses it and that's your command

198
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,539
it can be HTTP or HTTPS you could have

199
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:33,760
one that operates over ICMP and just

200
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:36,370
embed the data in like an ICMP echo

201
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,530
request and you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple</font>

202
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,720
channels in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same network depending</font>

203
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,330
on how complex and how to you want to

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,550
get who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BOP</font>

master this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the person who's</font>

206
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,490
controlling it you're inserting all the

commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going through some sort of</font>

web interface or however<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

209
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,590
will set up you're putting the commands

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,349
into the network so that your BOTS can

211
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:59,198
execute them you can divide the bots in

212
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:01,539
the logical groups if you so choose but

213
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,490
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're limited by what the</font>

bottom is built on you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> toss</font>

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font>

216
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:11,449
isn't written for so on to see two

217
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,289
channels right see two channels are the

218
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,259
means of transmitting the information

219
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:16,878
touched on this a little bit ago many

220
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:18,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">from protocols and the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to hide</font>

221
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,889
somewhat in plain sight you don't want

222
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,419
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's super crazy obvious</font>

223
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:26,599
that's going to say hey this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is me I'm</font>

224
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:29,659
beaconing back to this c2 server like

225
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:33,260
red team domain whatever is probably a

226
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:34,880
bad idea or this is like a c2 dog

227
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,729
whatever your domain is probably a bad

228
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,309
idea if you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS resolution you</font>

229
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,269
want to look normal right I'm just some

230
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:46,189
common protocols that you can use IRC

231
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:47,540
product to IRC is that it's plain text

232
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,790
traditionally so if you connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

233
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,800
server do you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the commands being</font>

234
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,589
broadcast in plain text you can see when

235
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,599
someone checks in the advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

236
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:58,970
is there's multiple different actual IRC

237
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,950
channels you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through HTTP and</font>

238
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">HTTPS would be a really good option</font>

239
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,720
probably your go-to option I don't know

240
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:10,940
of anybody that's going to be blocking

241
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:13,100
web outbound so HTTP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS</font>

242
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,920
would obviously better because well it's

243
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,690
encrypted and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you</font>

244
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,089
could do it over ICP if you wanted to

245
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,100
probably get a flight deal quick you can

246
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:25,850
even try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it or SSH or something</font>

247
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,699
that for me makes an ssh session so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

248
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:31,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go into a little bit of how IRC</font>

249
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:33,349
used to and currently is used by seats

250
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:36,290
use on the drawbacks and some of the

251
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,000
advantages to it so we have the client

252
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,349
like an IRC client that connects to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,959
server in this case it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be our</font>

254
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,850
bot it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be connecting to a</font>

255
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:48,469
certain channel right so let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

256
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:50,300
have palms channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> one right and it's</font>

257
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,860
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be checking in say hey I'm here</font>

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,130
waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for commands it's going to be</font>

relying on the IRC infrastructure to

00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,720
deliver the messages that the a certain

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">say us the bot master would go and you</font>

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,620
would say hey this command<font color="#CCCCCC"> know is 2d</font>

dos site a right all the pots are

listening

266
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,610
see to channel be like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's my</font>

267
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,310
command I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that and they</font>

268
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,230
execute whatever module is right and you

269
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,459
would have some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of way to change</font>

270
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,470
channels if reasonable option whether

271
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,870
it's through a command that says<font color="#CCCCCC"> migrate</font>

272
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,580
to whatever and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bots</font>

273
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,930
around there would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just migrated to that</font>

00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:29,839
automatically through the bottom some of

276
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,310
the advantages to using an IRC it's

277
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty easy to set up all you have to do</font>

278
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,229
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a channel and then have a pretty</font>

00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,000
simple syntax that both pots in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,990
it's your first thing to write

286
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,060
disadvantages you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending it in plain</font>

287
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,370
English right on encrypted

288
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,290
communications and if the bots are

289
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,170
validating who's sending the command

290
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:59,870
then it's relatively easy to hijack and

291
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:03,920
shut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network or make it do what</font>

292
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:05,360
you want to do so all this was kind of

293
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,640
bullying around in my head I was kind of

294
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,900
thinking hmm so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something</font>

295
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">with botnets I wonder</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

296
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,720
offensive right how would I set this up

297
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:17,600
what if I built my own right but before

298
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,089
that I was kind of thinking whom I want

299
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,530
to program something let's try IRC it's

300
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:23,750
a relatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple protocol that's</font>

301
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,480
really well fine so I thought wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

302
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:29,780
minute what if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like combine the</font>

303
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,350
two right so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to specify that i'm</font>

304
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,910
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> using IRC for this person concept</font>

305
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,950
not just making<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it connects to a</font>

306
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:40,339
channel business of stuff it's using how

307
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:44,300
IRC the protocol is set up and defined

308
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:45,380
to define the network of<font color="#E5E5E5"> c2 servers and</font>

309
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:51,380
how they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be updating each</font>

310
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:54,530
other so for a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> background IRC</font>

311
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,810
works as a spanning tree there's never a

312
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,180
group of nodes that are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be set</font>

313
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,510
in a loop or they're never should be

314
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,209
right if a B and C are all here a and C

315
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,769
should not

316
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:06,660
action if they both connect to be

317
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:07,980
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you have a loop and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

318
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,949
things happen and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just how the</font>

319
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">protocols set up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so why not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use that</font>

320
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:15,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">right it's pretty set up I could just</font>

321
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,790
fork IRC and modified whoever I want

322
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:19,949
right the problem with that is that

323
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,939
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going from redundancy at the sea</font>

324
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:26,969
to layer right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

325
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:30,779
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the rellenos oh that's</font>

326
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">very cool is that we don't need the</font>

327
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:41,269
relay notes we're focusing just on the

328
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:43,470
sea to server layer right now cool

329
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:45,029
imagine if you lose a branch that

330
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,410
happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the middle of your</font>

331
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:47,790
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> of servers you're going to end</font>

332
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,579
up causing network segmentation you're

333
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:53,550
going to have just jointed segments so

334
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:56,040
let's take this example IRC network

335
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,019
right IRC not to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too POC that</font>

336
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,649
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with we've got six servers</font>

337
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:03,629
to has three links we've got they're all

338
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,399
organized like that right so if someone

339
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:07,019
on server1 one to send a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message to</font>

340
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,259
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> six it would go through server to</font>

341
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three and after server sex if</font>

342
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:13,980
someone on server for when we get out to

343
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:17,490
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> three it would broadcast to</font>

344
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,379
everybody and IRC server would only keep

345
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,379
the message if it had clients that were

346
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,970
on those channels right want to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

347
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,009
message it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to travel along like</font>

348
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">this it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get duplicated and</font>

349
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:30,149
sent out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the other ones that's going</font>

350
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:31,589
to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so from for all the way</font>

351
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:34,920
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to six we can see the message was</font>

352
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:36,809
there right so imagine if we're gonna

353
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,799
lose one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these notes let's focus on</font>

354
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:43,049
server1 right if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose server one the</font>

355
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,209
clients on server1 or just out of luck

356
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:46,980
they can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything right they can't</font>

357
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:49,138
talk to anyone else because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server's</font>

358
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,939
down right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too bad we've</font>

359
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:53,850
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave lost in edge mode right</font>

360
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:56,339
if we lose server<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> however we're</font>

361
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,170
going to have a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so server six</font>

362
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,179
and server two are still functional

363
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,870
right but we've lost service free which

364
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:04,839
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've lost the connection to</font>

365
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,760
servers to and so to server<font color="#E5E5E5"> six so</font>

366
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,930
someone on server one will be able to

367
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to server sex right and someone on</font>

368
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,589
server1 can still talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to someone on</font>

369
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,329
server for but they can't get over there

370
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:18,520
and server<font color="#E5E5E5"> six is then it's on the world</font>

371
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,010
the worst case scenario for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

372
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,199
topology is if we lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> this note because</font>

373
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">we lose those links now we have three</font>

374
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,000
separate IRC networks that can't talk to

375
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">each other so that's kind of where I</font>

376
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,900
came in so like wait a minute this

377
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:35,589
spanning tree is a bad idea for<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

378
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:38,380
for redundancy at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> c 2 layer so let's</font>

379
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:40,480
expand it to a partial mesh a full mesh

380
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,920
would be ideal right all nodes know how

381
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,870
to talk to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other everything's</font>

382
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,699
amazing you only need one update message

383
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,140
goes out in one broadcast<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything's</font>

384
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:51,160
updated and flowers and rainbows yay um

385
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,290
reality that's probably not what you're

386
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,350
going to get you don't want one node or

387
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,510
you don't want the ability for one

388
00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:00,100
defender to breach or watch one node and

389
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:02,020
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know all of the nodes in your</font>

390
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,300
network because then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

391
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,370
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> government please shut these down</font>

392
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,250
it's doing malicious activity in here is

393
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:13,980
the information about it you can lose

394
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:16,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">your entire network matter of days so</font>

395
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,279
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the partial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mesh is that</font>

396
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,350
we're going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> forwarding the</font>

397
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,540
commands to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the servers kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

398
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:27,279
we were forwarding with the iron how IRC

399
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:29,770
was forwarding yeah so what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

400
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,420
to ensure right now is that much surgery

401
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,459
was going to have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same database this</font>

402
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,349
is a short-term<font color="#CCCCCC"> goal for the proof</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

403
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:37,810
concept for cons it's not finished yet

404
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,910
it's far from it I'll get into that in a

405
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,800
little bit later but if we have the

406
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:46,120
personal mess<font color="#CCCCCC"> organized correctly we can</font>

407
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:48,099
be tolerant<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mild to medium losses so</font>

408
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,650
let's say someone takes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 servers</font>

409
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,110
in your 60s server<font color="#CCCCCC"> network you still</font>

410
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:55,779
have the clients which know enough about

411
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:58,420
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network to reconnect</font>

412
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:59,980
back to it let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just assume for the</font>

413
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,839
rest of this talk that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clients have</font>

414
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,420
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithm that says</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we know how</font>

415
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,610
to get to a different area of the

416
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,839
network logically right so if a client

417
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,790
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the left side of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

418
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,530
knows that there are nodes in the middle

419
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,819
of the network and the right side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

420
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,100
network let's just assume that the

421
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:22,080
clients know how to get how know how to

422
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,460
get back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the network right but we got</font>

423
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,380

430
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:44,940
oh yeah so some of the design choices um

431
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,850
golang if you don't know about go it was

432

<font color="#E5E5E5">developed and released in 2006 I think</font>

443
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,680
the servers are going to silently ignore

444
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,560
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> become a little</font>

445
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,570
more clear a little bit why did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I choose</font>

446
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,179
to go with the way how about to show you

447
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:25,800
I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would have been easier than</font>

448
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implementing a for</font>

449
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,830
peer-to-peer routing mechanism on a

450
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:32,129
server that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be deploying in</font>

451
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,710
random places I could use Batman if

452
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,180
you're not familiar with Batman it's the

453
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,330
better approach to mobile ad hoc

454
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:41,070
networking basically it's a layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ad</font>

455
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,110
hoc networking protocol that's actually

456
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,820
built into the Linux kernel now that

457
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,469
facilitates ad hoc networking and

458
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,030
routing but I felt that that would

459
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,380
probably a hard thing to do and go and

460
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,540
probably have to write my own libraries

461
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,700
so let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the partial mesh</font>

462
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,170
and a forwarding and the silently

463
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,110
ignoring the redundant messages for now

464
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,330
that might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a later work and there's</font>

465
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:03,899
this idea of a partial information chain

466
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,889
versus a full information chain for

467
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,910
right now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to define the</font>

468
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:10,520
information chain as the servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

469
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,160
are going to be receiving<font color="#E5E5E5"> an update</font>

470
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,690
partial is going to

471
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,550
include just the servers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font>

472
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,460
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> receiving a full information chain</font>

473
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:20,950
would be all servers that have received

474
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,510
and sent the message problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that</font>

475
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,670
is that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase traffic</font>

476
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,710
size exponentially with one or two nodes

477
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,850
it's not that big but if you have 50

478
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,740
node<font color="#CCCCCC"> network you're going to have a</font>

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:33,219
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of servers saying hey 1 27</font>

480
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,990

around it's pretty conspicuous it's

483
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:44,260
pretty easy to see so they algorithm

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> server's is going to</font>

establishing pure connections with other

see two servers whenever there is an

update<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the command database it's</font>

going to notify all other local peers

490
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,760
the servers are only going to be

491
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,330
knowledgeable of other peers that are in

492
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:06,220
the network locally one hop away doesn't

know anything more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hot so for</font>

494
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,170
the pure server connection peers are

495
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,070
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact each other ideally it's</font>

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,380
going to validate each other's

497
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,730
authenticity a long term goal that I

498
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,710
have for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is to be able to turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

499
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,450
into a framework say generate a key at

500
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,580
the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that you have a TLS</font>

501
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,590
key or a TLS assert that's going to be

502
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,449
valid for each of the nodes and if

503
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,100
certain isn't match you don't connect to

504
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,260
the network or don't accept any

505
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,850
communications from other nodes in the

506
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,750
network so that is resistant to

507
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:36,459
hijacking and you can either do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at a</font>

508
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,740
periodic intervals you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do it like</font>

509
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">an HD vs you vs check-in or you could</font>

510
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a constant session but like</font>

511
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,140
navigating an SSH or something like that

512
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,240
so whenever the command database is

513
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,090
updated whether it be by the master or

514
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:55,690
whether it received an update from

515
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:57,939
another client we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ignore any</font>

516
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:02,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> duplicate it's going to save for</font>

517
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:04,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">now all messages that are there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

518
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,630
the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be notifying all</font>

519
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,700
of us local peers

520
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,320
and for the server the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server updates</font>

521
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,180
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> update all their peers</font>

522
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,540
that it did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the message from</font>

523
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:17,630
right so if we have servers a b c and d

524
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,040
and b is connected to CDA so we've got

525
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,100
one in the middle and three on the

526
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,020
outside if a sends an update to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> B is</font>

527
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,790
going to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out to c</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and d but not</font>

528
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,620
a because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it knows that it got it from a</font>

529
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:30,139
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have an infinite balance</font>

530
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,060
between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes and then each of those</font>

531
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,320
updates is going to contain the partial

532
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,649
information chain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got a bunch</font>

533
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,260
of diagrams it's not display that later

534
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,370
so more information on the partial

535
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,990
information chain it's going to be

536
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,959
containing the IDS of the server that

537
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:47,420
the updates being sent to and if the ID

538
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,450
is listed as a peer it's not going to

539
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,460
notify that<font color="#E5E5E5"> server and it's just</font>

540
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember that it's ignoring duplicate</font>

541
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,450
updates silently so let's take the

542
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:59,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">simplest network that we can have two</font>

543
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">notes of the sea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two servers right we</font>

544
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,600
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> message with the partial</font>

545
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,120
information chain set to 2 because

546
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,080
that's the destination is currently you

547
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">can think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the partial information</font>

548
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:13,189
chain has the destinations for all

549
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:15,530
messages or multicast so we send the

550
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,830
message over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and then it gets it</font>

551
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:20,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah all the databases were updated so</font>

552
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,060
if we expand<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we have servers 12 and</font>

553
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,399
30 organized in a line one wants to send

554
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:28,129
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> message updates the database sends the</font>

555
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,870
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to 22 gets it realizes that</font>

556
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,020
it can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it to one because it got</font>

557
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,489
it got it from one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it has to send it</font>

558
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,920
to three because that's the only other

559
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,630
peer that it knows about 73 gets it

560
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,550
realizes that the only peer that it has

561
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,830
is to and will not send it to two

562
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:45,260
because well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the link that it</font>

563
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:48,590
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> from and then everything's happy in</font>

564
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,540
the databases are updated so expand<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

565
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,480
a little bit we have four servers now

566
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then there's a triangle that we have</font>

567
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,550
between servers two three and four

568
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,980
starting with server one to be sending

569
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too so here's where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

570
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,380
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> see what the partial</font>

571
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,350
information chain actually does

572
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,210
something so server soon realizes that

573
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,309
it has to

574
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,659
two servers three and four because those

575
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:13,480
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other peers and it can send it</font>

576
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:15,820
back to one so it sends it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out servers</font>

577
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,529
four and three both realizes that the

578
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,809
other server is<font color="#E5E5E5"> winning at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the message</font>

579
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:21,100
at the same time and then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> says okay</font>

580
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:22,990
well I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send it because</font>

581
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're already getting it and then</font>

582
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:28,179
everything's happy right all the

583
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:30,640
databases were updated so let's expand

584
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:32,799
this 26 notes this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is essentially the</font>

585
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,559
IRC network that we had earlier but

586
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,740
instead of having six being isolated

587
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:41,620
only 23 we've now connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> five so</font>

588
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big loop so we have an</font>

589
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,459
update that comes from server one it's

590
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,289
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go out to survey ship so ever</font>

591
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,289
to realizes that it has to send it to

592
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:52,299
service three and five right and then

593
00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:53,919
server three over there it says okay

594
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:56,470
well i got it from two and i'm going to

595
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,399
fit it to six server 5 says okay I've

596
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,870
got peers server for and server six and

597
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:05,279
i got it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from two so i'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

598
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:08,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">send it to right so what we run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into is</font>

599
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:12,880
both of the servers are going to be

600
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:14,620
notifying the same target server right

601
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,210
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four is over in its own little</font>

602
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,699
world doesn't have any more peers that's

603
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,440
okay but this is where the silent

604
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,149
ignoring comes in and it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

605
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">silently ignore one of the messages that</font>

606
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:30,820
looks green well it's supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

607
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:35,678
yellow okay well okay so it's going to

608
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:38,889
silently in one of the messages so where

609
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,380
does this idea of the fault tolerance

610
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,330
come in it's a combination of things

611
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,120
it's a combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the command</font>

612
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,020
database updates and the commands

613
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,629
synchronization synchronization between

614
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,129
the service and the network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

615
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,930
rely on the clients having a chain of

616
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,090
domains to contact in the network

617
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:58,660
saying earlier they had the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

618
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,399
contact far different areas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

619
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,050
network so if one side of the network is

620
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,270
taken down the other side is a

621
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:09,909
functional and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client can migrate to</font>

622
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:15,810
another side and the idea that that's

623
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:18,370
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said so goals for the project</font>

624
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">short-term goals what I have right now</font>

625
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the servers we may be accepting</font>

626
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,450
communications to the clients little

627
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,740
buggy there's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a default</font>

628
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,750
channel placement and then later on

629
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,640
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be the ability to</font>

630
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,050
segment it off into<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so like these</font>

these are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be my data exfil</font>

target you can divvy<font color="#E5E5E5"> off commands</font>

636
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,150
because you don't want to be issuing dos

637
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,580
commands to your ones that are supposed

638
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,870
to be sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hiding right you don't</font>

639
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,970
want a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic coming from those</font>

640
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:53,409
because it's saying hey guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at me</font>

641
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:54,790
on here I'm doing bad things server<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

642
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,830
going to be responding<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the clients</font>

643
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:59,050
requests in that database replication

644
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:02,110
across all the servers is going to be

645
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:04,120
enabled<font color="#CCCCCC"> by default a later work that</font>

646
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:07,179
could be done is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it functions more</font>

647
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,399
close to IRC and then it doesn't contain

648
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,900
any of the updates for clients that it

649
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,090
does not have or channels that it does

650
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,250
not have and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does it queries the</font>

651
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,169
network to forward it but that would

652
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,670
involve a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the routing so</font>

653
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,080
there's some design decisions that I

654
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,760
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make down the road if I want to</font>

655
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue this any further and have those</font>

656
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,900
things so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term goals like I was</font>

657
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying the TLS surf generation and the</font>

658
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,960
validation between all the servers to

659
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">ensure that you can't just connect</font>

660
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,360
something into the network that's going

661
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:38,590
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> update the database saying hey I want</font>

662
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to paying all these addresses so</font>

663
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,830
that i can know where all of your

664
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,210
thoughts are and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> c2 service</font>

665
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,970
to notify this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can have someone</font>

666
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:49,150
take them all down full forwarding and

667
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,950
database replication and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to I'd</font>

668
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:54,190
like to make it into a big project<font color="#E5E5E5"> input</font>

669
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,870
a web administration panel on it how the

670
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,940
ability to dispense different modules to

671
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,500
clients so let's say

672
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,840
have a generic client that's in there

673
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,770
you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well I'm going to check</font>

674
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,840
into the network and I'm going to

675
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,710
download this information or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

676
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,419
to download<font color="#E5E5E5"> these modules to perform</font>

677
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:12,360
persistence moderate<font color="#E5E5E5"> resistance method X</font>

678
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:15,060
or persistence method why the whole idea

679
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind go is that it's a cross-platform</font>

680
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:20,520
language you right things and go and it

681
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,709
for the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unless you're doing</font>

682
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,629
something extremely five or system

683
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,460
specific is going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on</font>

684
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,500
different systems so if you have an

685
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,770
implant that's written in one of those

686
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:35,790
networks it can download things cater to

687
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:37,170
BOS at it's on another<font color="#E5E5E5"> big thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

688
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:41,820
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is I want to make it into an</font>

689
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:43,530
HTTP or HTTPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> c2i at the first part</font>

690
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,120
decided I was going to do with opening a

691
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,350
rock connection and sending information

692
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,959
at this point I'd known if it's

693
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,909
encrypted but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a let's get it</font>

694
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,830
working before I actually organize

695
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,050
things the way that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and then</font>

696
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,090
maybe expand it into a potential

697
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:59,669
framework for an automated deployment

698
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,770
and make it an open source framework to

699
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:05,150
say build a botnet it could be useful

700
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:08,400
for penetration testers who want to do

701
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:10,740
some long-term engagements so that you

702
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a network that you can build up and</font>

703
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:17,820
tear down an issue shut up<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

704
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:19,680
commands to your network so things that

705
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,230
definitely need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be improved a bit</font>

706
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,300
using an actual database<font color="#CCCCCC"> strengthened</font>

707
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,010
just storing data types memory there's

708
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,990
some janky code in there now that

709
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely need to fix and then</font>

710
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:33,810
currently the ids for the clients and

711
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,430
servers have the same format I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

712
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,550
differentiate those maybe just add a

713
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:43,110
flag in there that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> if one client is</font>

714
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:46,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">0 sir so on to</font>

715
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:49,290
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a code demo we're going</font>

716
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:57,960
to walk through some of the functions

717
00:27:49,290 --> 00:28:00,299
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have set up right now so over in</font>

718
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,570
this pain over here no you can't see any

719
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:02,570
of that

720
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:23,860
good yeah you can not read any of that

721
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,870
everybody read what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ganda</font>

722
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:31,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">will flick the lights in the back maybe</font>

723
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:33,909
it'll be better hopefully better<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

724
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:40,390
everybody ok with that for like five

725
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:42,610
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok cool so over in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this left</font>

726
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:45,640
pane I have two suppositories one foot

727
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:48,850
server one for the client over here we

728
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:52,539
have all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server stuff launch the</font>

729
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:55,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the server reads from a command</font>

730
00:28:52,539 --> 00:29:02,140
file so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into the commands</font>

731
00:28:55,299 --> 00:29:03,879
directory we can see that i have several

732
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,679
things like add a command channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

733
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,419
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be like aw get command</font>

734
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,460
or a ping command those just the two

735
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:11,440
commands that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I chose to implement at</font>

736
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,330
the current time before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I expanded into</font>

737
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,280
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so that ability to trains</font>

738
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">transmit commands and then it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

739
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:21,970
matter of writing an execute function on

740
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:27,940
the client so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see we're just</font>

741
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:31,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting about default port yeah so we</font>

742
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,970
have the client which is over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

743
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:38,439
listed as the implant and right now it

744
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:40,510
connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the server few debug</font>

745
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,190
messages in there and right now we're

746
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,570
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the HTTP GET right here so we've</font>

747
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,000
transferred the message and we've

748
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:48,870
actually got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> execute a lot we get the</font>

749
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,270
error message saying cannot get the URL

750
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:55,840
1.html just as an example and then when

751
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:58,840
we request again the client right now is

752
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,668
set up so that it does another request

753
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,299
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a enter button</font>

754
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:06,159
that'll obviously be changed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

755
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:08,350
one or two bugs that cause the client to

756
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,330
crash that came about like a day or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

757
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:12,549
ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I cannot seem to figure out how</font>

758
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:15,260
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it so I kind of had a little bit</font>

759
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:18,410
of a stunted demo right now

760
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:20,790
the server to server messaging is

761
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:24,450
unfortunately not functional I would

762
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:27,450
love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show that that's one of my</font>

763
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:30,300
biggest oh darn why didn't i get this

764
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,410
workings about this talk so that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

765
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,060
was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus a little more</font>

766
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:34,890
heavily into the explanation of how it

767
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">would go i ended up getting most of</font>

768
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:39,600
these supporting things but not main

769
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:41,820
thing oh darn so we can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a</font>

770
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,730
little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code review on the</font>

771
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,730
server side so

772
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:55,760
cool so for the server we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea</font>

773
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,230
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an ID it's</font>

774
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,330
going to be having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a listener that it's</font>

775
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:02,179
maybe a student connections on a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

776
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:06,470
clients a certificate which at this

777
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:07,490
moment is not being used<font color="#CCCCCC"> piers the</font>

778
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,770
channels that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be having</font>

779
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">and forwarding in replication those</font>

780
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">boolean's am I going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be forwarding</font>

781
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:17,690
things on where am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I not going to be</font>

782
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:20,059
replicating the database the idea that

783
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:21,890
you might not want to forward some

784
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:23,178
things on as maybe you have one or two

785
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,670
servers you've been planted in a

786
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:28,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">target's network you don't want the</font>

787
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,050
database replicating everything for

788
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,030
things that aren't connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

789
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,340
Network so you want something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

790
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:38,809
you're implanting on targets network to

791
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:42,199
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more covert so like I was</font>

792
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:44,059
saying the ID generation function it's

793
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,980
basically slapping together a random

794
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:48,950
number and a hash of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> timestamp and</font>

795
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:50,540
then hashing those together<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charlie</font>

796
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,429
those are the same I should probably add

797
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:55,129
another field to differentiate between a

798
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:56,420
client and server at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

799
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:59,210
have it sending server or client

800
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:01,450
depending on what it is to connect to

801
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,450
each other

802
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:16,080
so the channels are organized as such we

803
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:20,360
have lists of clients<font color="#CCCCCC"> a list of commands</font>

804
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:24,629
and ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add clients add the commands</font>

805
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:27,120
and do as such currently this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

806
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,620
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about saying I should</font>

807
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably switch to something else other</font>

808
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">than just having an array in there I</font>

809
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,379
should probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch using a database</font>

810
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,149
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd allow me to actually</font>

811
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">support more and build out more</font>

812
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:44,250
currently the code only supports a first

813
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:46,908
default channel in the server super

814
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,909
early on time

815
00:32:53,929 --> 00:33:02,980
so here's kind of the idea behind the

816
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:02,980
commands<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current data structure</font>

817
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:12,710
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind the commands is that</font>

818
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,929
they have an ID associated with them a

819
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,519
description and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parameters are going</font>

820
00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:18,619
to be passed to them right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's set</font>

821
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:20,869
up as a list of strings so that you can

822
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:22,428
facilitate any command that you'd like

823
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:25,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do so right now the commands that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

824
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:27,590
have only have one parameter passed to

825
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,210
it w get you only need URL or the pain

826
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,320
you only need the target IP address or

827
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:36,289
domain name right but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I had</font>

828
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,700
something for copy the folder copy the

829
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:39,769
contents of these directories and

830
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:43,269
exfiltrate them to my server that's

831
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:46,340
facilitating multiple directories or

832
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:48,049
multiple lists of things and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

833
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,908
information is transferred it's going to

834
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:53,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">be put into a JSON object and then</font>

835
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:55,850
base64 for transfer and then it's

836
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:59,299
labeled with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamp so that you</font>

837
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:01,879
know of the when it's attached to the

838
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:04,269
channel the list of commands that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font>

839
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:07,519
the channel it's going to look at the

840
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:09,230
furthest right most entry the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> entry</font>

841
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the list of commands and say what's</font>

842
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,879
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time step on that is that timestamp</font>

843
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:16,479
later than what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have if it is it's</font>

844
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:20,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to add it if not it's going to</font>

845
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,829
just discard the vessel silently

846
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:34,529
yeah so that is unfortunately all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

847
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:36,949
have for code it is multi-threaded so if

848
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:36,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">we wanted to</font>

849
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:49,969
we're not facilitating multiple multiple

850
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:53,239
clients so it is accepting those clients

851
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:58,299
from there but that is about all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

852
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:58,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">have for the code side of things</font>

853
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:14,070
cool so does anybody have any questions

854
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,590
why did I decide to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing in</font>

855
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:19,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way what do I want to yeah you can</font>

856
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:22,260
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lights back on thank you any</font>

857
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:26,640
ideas for the network open up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

858
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:32,820
questions yes that so how does the false

859
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:35,250
homes work if say the link between if

860
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:41,730
you go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the example with I think</font>

861
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:44,190
the six or this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one yes yeah yeah so if</font>

862
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,830
you skip forward a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font>

863
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:53,580
there's a the fuck collision so when you

864
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:56,640
hit five yeah it assumes that that yes

865
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:58,590
so five knows that it needs to send a

866
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,000
foreign<font color="#CCCCCC"> six the previous ones in use</font>

867
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:07,860
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be visually example it's the</font>

868
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,380
quad code<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 for no one this one yes so</font>

869
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,240
server for assumes<font color="#CCCCCC"> at three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

870
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:16,110
message but if the link between two and

871
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,939
three is broken how is three<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

872
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:20,330
get the message if for assumes at three

873
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,680
governments that's another one of the

874
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:24,720
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one of the shortcomings</font>

875
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what I had short of implementing the</font>

876
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">full peer-to-peer grabbing so in lieu of</font>

877
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,090
implementing the full peer-to-peer

878
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:34,410
routing which would be an end goal for

879
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,270
this that's that's one of the drawbacks

880
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,160
is that if you do have linked down

881
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,840
between one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them that there is some</font>

882
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,299
sort of loop there you're going to get

883
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:46,540
servers that don't have the message

884
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:50,890
yes that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem any other</font>

885
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:53,080
questions this matter what kind of

886
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:55,089
client like what operating system one

887
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:58,120
like how how much like what are you

888
00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:01,900
using his clients it's so so for the

889
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:05,140
client it's a piece that I wrote pretty

890
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,640
writing it and go just just because the

891
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:10,450
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that it tracks whatever</font>

892
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:14,470
operating system it is so actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

893
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:21,060
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your displays now but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we go</font>

894
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:21,060
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the code this is my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client code</font>

895
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:42,770
right so over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the execute</font>

896
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:45,560
pink right so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a library for</font>

897
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:47,780
executing a ping command and how it

898
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,150
works is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say hey perform a</font>

899
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:52,250
ping and then the go compiler performs

900
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:54,260
all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating system specific</font>

901
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:57,170
stuff so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea if you write it</font>

902
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:59,030
in a language that actually transfers to

903
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,560
multiple different systems that's one of

904
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,930
the cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> things about go is a lot of it</font>

905
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,609
is designed so that you only have to

906
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,799
worry about making it work for that go

907
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:08,509
compiler and then it works for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

908
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,050
operating systems it's not like Python

909
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:15,050
which compiles to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bytecode and gets</font>

910
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:17,540
wrong specifically through there it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

911
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:19,190
I guess it is down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a byte code and</font>

912
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,810
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bytecode</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is specified within</font>

913
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,940
the compiler so I guess there is

914
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:28,029
precompiler and then I operating system

915
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:30,859
specific compiler any other questions

916
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:34,280
yes back there

917
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:37,279
did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider using SNMP toward</font>

918
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,280
national

919
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:41,000
when you said that you want some

920
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,620
deserved especially the dawn service to

921
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,240
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut at the level of a level of</font>

922
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:52,868
being

923
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:55,220
be not seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> tricon wanna trafficking</font>

924
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:57,019
could you say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last half of that</font>

925
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:59,779
sentence<font color="#E5E5E5"> I blessed having that can you</font>

926
00:38:57,019 --> 00:39:03,680
put a firewall and rebate you don't want

927
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:05,079
to trap you yeah so one of the ideas is

928
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,129
that you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the generic node</font>

929
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:09,739
call back to the network the network

930
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:11,420
would know hey any nodes that are coming

931
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:14,150
from something that resolved would like

932
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,829
reverse dns resolves to this domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font>

933
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that like the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company done trying</font>

934
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:20,299
party let's say I'm trying to attack RIT

935
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,579
write anything that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

936
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:24,650
calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> back that resolves to an RN</font>

937
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:26,180
today do you dress I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this</font>

938
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:28,430
set of commands and be put into this

939
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,950
channel or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like I'm trying to</font>

940
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:33,618
attack M&T bank or someone who comes

941
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:36,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">from like a tee time warner cable</font>

942
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:39,619
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to be part of my arm</font>

943
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">dos location so the server network would</font>

944
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:42,769
have the ability to differentiate<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

945
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:45,440
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> these criteria let's put this</font>

946
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:47,390
client into the either the default

947
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,420
channel which most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them will be put</font>

948
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:53,348
into and will not be used as much except

949
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:55,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like updates and such to the bots or</font>

950
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,720
based on where they're coming from put

951
00:39:55,369 --> 00:40:00,609
them into a specific channel that you

952
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">created oh oh that's all in our process</font>

953
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:09,150
yeah you would so the end goal for that

954
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:10,859
is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a rule set like</font>

955
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe through webinar face for the</font>

956
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:14,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">administrators say okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything coming</font>

957
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:18,150
from here add to this channel that I've

958
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:20,869
created and give it just instructions on

959
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:23,640
how to divide them to channel that would

960
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:25,910
go right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> backend</font>

961
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,890
server I'm a switch it to something else

962
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:31,649
if go ends up not being the proper

963
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:34,500
language to do exactly what I want but

964
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:38,819
for the current term yes go will

965
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:41,040
facilitate all that someone else had a

966
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:43,710
question yeah Brad<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mentioned that</font>

967
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:48,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you wanted to have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to push</font>

968
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:50,080
out updated modules for augmented

969
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:53,680
performance of the

970
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:56,950
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> glens correct yeah so plan on doing</font>

971
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,490
that since go they compile statically to

972
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,509
binary so you can't really use system

973
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,879
libraries with it unless you're pushing

974
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,560
out a system based process or<font color="#E5E5E5"> cook with</font>

975
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,750
it so how are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try and do</font>

976
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,480
the updates so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea could be that</font>

977
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:14,560
the employment that you have is more of

978
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,240
a driver for other pieces of malware

979
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,130
that you have running warnings you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

980
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,069
do you could have separate scripts

981
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:22,750
you're going to have separate pieces of

982
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">cove running on the machine but</font>

983
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimately the implants going to be more</font>

984
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a driver for things and facilitates</font>

985
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:36,190
those other tasks staying afloat any

986
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:38,920
other questions ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple special</font>

987
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:40,960
thanks thanks to jamie for encouraging

988
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,670
me to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this talk and then</font>

989
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,820
Brad for introducing me to go and

990
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:48,460
general design<font color="#E5E5E5"> assistance and such those</font>

991
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:50,170
