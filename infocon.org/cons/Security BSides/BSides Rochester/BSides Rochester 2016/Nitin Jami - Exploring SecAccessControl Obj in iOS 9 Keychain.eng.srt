you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you are it is a movie app and</font>

19
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:18,140
this is my first time speaking the

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:19,790
conference thank you so the basic

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:23,150
outline is very simple so a little bit

22
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:26,300
introduction about is teaching why am I

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:29,300
doing this for<font color="#CCCCCC"> evocation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my ski jet</font>

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:32,149
since its inception after is<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine and</font>

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,789
then something the Christian has changed

26
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,550
for my essay and that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> axis</font>

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,430
controller object will be looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it</font>

28
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:45,710
and then finally showcasing both the

29
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:49,700
rules so um assistant teaching is

30
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:53,179
basically of a secure storage puddin pie

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,280
OS operating system even think of it as

32
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,580
a password management tool or where it

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,540
would store all your secrets

34
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:05,710
certificates and<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything I device I</font>

35
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:09,649
think it has a gap of foreign me but

36
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,170
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> said that a lot of secrets will</font>

37
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:14,600
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> stored in a speech at hand it should</font>

38
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,450
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> floating them oh it's a single</font>

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,250
teacher for all apps or however we'll

40
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,109
talk a bit about practice groups and

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:26,830
that is how the isolation fragments and

42
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:31,940
each app each at this is only able to

43
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:33,730
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> its own item or or if of fits</font>

44
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,019
like a glove

45
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,760
elephant access group then you have a

46
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:42,640
set of applications from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

developer team safe house urban blacks

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,470
is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maintained as a</font>

49
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:51,640
simple I database and that's basically

50
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:55,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> path DJ Clue database that's over</font>

51
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:58,899
them and the different classes for

00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">random as a generic password Oh Internet</font>

53
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,030
passwords for Safari and stuff and then

54
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:10,770
search includes anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

55
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:14,370
so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all battery but spring move</font>

56
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,709
along<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that is the</font>

57
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,140
rate of production and if you have been

58
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:22,440
out here at the debit should stop it's

59
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:26,609
pretty similar on how of the progression

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:34,709
from under me and all the tea bags that

61
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:38,330
allow or when I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of time so</font>

62
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:42,750
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going too deep into the kitchen</font>

63
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:45,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">is already being taken care of so what I</font>

64
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:51,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">am going to focus is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the user</font>

65
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:54,599
layer just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> surface and it's very</font>

66
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:57,780
analogous to a file system production

67
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,329
you have like when unlock after us

68
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,670
unlock accessible<font color="#E5E5E5"> always which means</font>

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:06,000

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlocked and after personal mark is</font>

when the item is not available under

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:17,219
sorry that I'm is available after first

74
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:23,090
half review so always<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nice</font>

75
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:25,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">prediction and it's never in prepared so</font>

76
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:29,690
but think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some considerations oh</font>

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,690
the night's dinner prediction

the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> stability sequence your apps</font>

79
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:41,128
so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> them love this the default right</font>

80
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:43,800
now which is like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit contrary</font>

81
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,360
to the anise<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire protection wear ananas</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">awkward Jennings phenomena but</font>

84
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,650
that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're a piston some</font>

85
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,159
backtracking work you wouldn't be able

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:59,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use it so you want after first look</font>

87
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:01,650
for bad when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gaps and the most</font>

88
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:05,539
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that accessible</font>

always<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be deprecated in iOS 9 but</font>

90
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:13,318
if you still see the iOS 9 API lives are

91
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,449
you see that changed from from about to

92
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:23,159
let a constant so that means access

93
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:26,520
below resistant<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so this is just to</font>

94
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:29,509
give some perspective on how how an item

95
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,270
gets stored inside the secure and clear

96
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:36,719
using the kitchen so the application of

97
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:40,440
security from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current user space and</font>

98
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:42,330
your application put Adam would use one

99
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,460
of those security networks aps like

100
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:48,370
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> side</font>

101
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do better to add an idol inside the</font>

kitchen the security framework runs our

demon as well of that demon takes care

104
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,950
with our our problem with the colonel on

105
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:04,030
adding<font color="#E5E5E5"> that item however if you see that</font>

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:06,219
Keystone prior to iphone 5<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have 25 or</font>

107
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,900
free based devices they do not have

108
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,180
secured and<font color="#CCCCCC"> kept secure and Claire was</font>

109
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,039
introduced in icon fires and the

110
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,600
keystore was stood in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kernel so that</font>

111
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,140
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the cryptographic keys</font>

112
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,950
that are useful for for the kitchen

113
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:23,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">items are very much accessible it's only</font>

114
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:26,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">from our pious you see that the keystore</font>

115
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:30,310
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> safe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the second</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> round clip and if</font>

116
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,599
you have been litigated stuff he

117
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,340
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> talks a little bit about</font>

118
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,570
secondhand try on how security at

119
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:41,590
present so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could use a touch ID or</font>

120
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:43,450
device bus code to further access one of

121
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,888
those items and we talked a little bit

122
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,300
more

123
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:50,550
or how that goes above so like I said

124
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,240
using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kitchen definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clears</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,650
pilots<font color="#E5E5E5"> wears a very small set of a ps1</font>

126
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,100
compared to<font color="#CCCCCC"> present</font>

127
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,599
for ad copy matching is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

128
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">extracting the keys out of the kitchen</font>

129
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,250
and then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a degree however</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

130
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,900
order to get some more reserved useful

131
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,639
features there are underfunded<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

132
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,120
functions i get prediction on credit and

133
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,979
strength so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a reminder so you</font>

134
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,350
would want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like what kind of</font>

135
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">protection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this item must have a hand if</font>

136
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:21,440
you want to flag it or not so these are

137
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,440
the functions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> lick you know</font>

138
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,759
so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some important attributes</font>

139
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,759
as far as the kitchen Stinson<font color="#E5E5E5"> account</font>

140
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Magnus of anything that your app tries</font>

141
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,470
to store we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of it as like a</font>

142
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">continent inside your application or</font>

143
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,930
just use the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff like that so</font>

144
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:43,270
account names can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> mainly for a single</font>

145
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,520
application service no man is basically

146
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:48,789
like a number of us were to an app

147
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,229
itself you can have more of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

148
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:55,060
as well but there are movements like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

149
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:56,349
within the service name and then Isis

150
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,039
group that is what I was talking about

151
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:01,360
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here access company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finds like</font>

152
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,590
defines the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bonding for each each an</font>

153
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,070
item so if you do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to share an</font>

154
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,299
item with any other apps then<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

155
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:13,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">access group will be only for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

156
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:17,889
particular option for your application

157
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:21,460
but so<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if you have more than one</font>

158
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:25,539
application you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could use this access</font>

159
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,520
group to to give that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do more</font>

160
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:29,919
number of apps but it still needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

161
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">come from the same developer intimate it</font>

162
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,510
needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent from the same developer</font>

163
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,169
and protections that is what we are

164
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,380
interested

165
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:42,179
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> accessibility which I talk to you</font>

166
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,179
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worth looking at</font>

167
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:54,300
so of research books and that is why I'm

168
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:58,029
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> today so one of the main</font>

169
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:01,329
motivations behind as it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we all</font>

170
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:03,040
know we all recommend as a security and

171
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:07,469
serpents that drunk kitchen is the

172
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,719
recommended storage area and stuff but

173
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,329
but it needs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be noted that not all</font>

174
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,819
that refers use the keygen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and city of</font>

175
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:19,719
me so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the times you see that all</font>

176
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:21,550
these items are are like use the least

177
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,310
amount of protection like accessible

178
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,810
always and this happens because and when

179
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,060
we talk to developers we understand that

180
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,420
as the app for spring they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

181
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,500
understand which application needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

182
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,269
used with the full protection like

183
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">monaural of garbage application needs</font>

184
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:40,449
which i can sorry which I can needs to

185
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:42,819
be used a while back running so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

186
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:45,849
does not work for some reason they just

187
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:47,620
switch on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> just switch to access a</font>

188
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,410
book always for all the items<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's</font>

189
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:54,129
the application<font color="#E5E5E5"> just works for them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

190
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:56,230
it's still to this day that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see more</font>

191
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:59,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">and more applications use accessible</font>

192
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:03,069
always so it it is a good area for a

193
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:06,369
century tea vendors to look at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

194
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:08,380
come from that ledge if if an

195
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,090
application using an

196
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:14,590
on the kitchen<font color="#CCCCCC"> it should be secured</font>

197
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:17,260
problem however<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are most previous</font>

198
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:20,050
work but since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have said a lot of</font>

199
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">tools have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stacking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great and this</font>

200
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,810
is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of restructuring of</font>

201
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:28,720
Boston within the file system within the

202
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:31,930
operating system as itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> from I I say</font>

203
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,080
and as I brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of changes</font>

204
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:38,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">Iceland even brought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more changes so all</font>

205
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:42,040
this previous tools uh no longer

206
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:45,010
supported right now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> keychain is</font>

207
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensitive so we would want to hack it in</font>

208
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:51,640
case so the previous work you guys have

209
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,970
already heard about jackie chan kin-por

210
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,490
a keygen newer which was which was

211
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">really working well kill is 6 and ayah</font>

212
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:06,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">samish but after that it wouldn't work</font>

213
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:09,250
and the way for a kitchen where these up

214
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:12,120
these tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moment will go to focus</font>

215
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:17,130
only on a jailbroken device because of

216
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,130
Jake Brooklyn a jailbroken device but

217
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,510
would disable all the integrity checks

218
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,060
or write code signing or entitlements

219
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:29,279
check so I did now have an application

220
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:32,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">with an entitlement as star so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

221
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:35,040
so like I said a real kitchen access

222
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:37,529
group would define life what

223
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,420
applications put your food item have

224
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,220
access to but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you just give a while</font>

225
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,060
silently that means your application

226
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:48,480
will have access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that the kitchen</font>

227
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:52,739
now this books because there is a demon

228
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,600
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anthony which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> runs and most of the</font>

229
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,360
jailbreakers in order for them to run

230
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,129
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfettered court lady they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disable</font>

231
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,980
equity this that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

232
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:04,550
they do open the jailbreak so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am feed</font>

233
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:08,990
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple in mobile file integrity</font>

234
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:11,878
demon and that demon is responsible to

235
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,670
to validate this and ask them in fact

236
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,050
with that of the apple key and since

237
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,729
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know who works</font>

238
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:21,300
properly now we could have an attacker

239
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,620
and run flag with about anything and we

240
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,809
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a star which means</font>

241
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:29,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can have access to all that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

242
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:32,459
said we could dump it so the main

243
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:34,319
motivation behind we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

244
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:37,349
research on teaching and then writing

245
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:40,019
tools is that like I said existing tools

246
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,360
it work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes movements I'm</font>

247
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:47,430
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aside and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I assign those</font>

248
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:49,320
tools would not work and we talked a bit

249
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:52,469
about the evolution of the kitchen

250
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,090
we'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 8 as a lot of</font>

251
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,460
changes and therefore there is no

252
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,800
support absolutely no support and one of

253
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that if you if you run if you</font>

254
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,689
manage to run the previous loops you

255
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:08,040
will see that instead of these long I

256
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">hyperx is about one block you see those</font>

257
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,709
sharp homes<font color="#E5E5E5"> anc IDK which are basically</font>

258
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,480
the same thing as<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

259
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:19,260
internal representations of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

260
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,140
those tools would just display a casing

261
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:26,160
getting in which gives a lot of problem

262
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:28,740
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we point to any standard and the</font>

263
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">doctor is the number be you really huge</font>

264
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,780
if if you're you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with a lot</font>

265
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">of applications that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the dump would be</font>

266
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,699
really big<font color="#E5E5E5"> because applets of source a</font>

267
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,380
lot of fun times in his kitchen and on

268
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,410
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that there are many applications</font>

269
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:46,860
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone so there is no big church</font>

270
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,839
through out of that place sure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

271
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">regret but it would be nice to have</font>

272
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,330
something in Whitman's at the pool

273
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,569
itself and then Eddie editing and

274
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:58,860
deleting kitchen on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the flyer yes but</font>

275
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,590
most of the times what happens is that

276
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:05,730
you invest a particular application but

277
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:07,470
then but then you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to edit or</font>

278
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">ticketed sure you could delete the</font>

279
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,430
application but anything the application

280
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,860
does not ensure that the item is related

281
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:16,530
so you'll have all the settings in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

282
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,050
kitchen asses but you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to delete</font>

283
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,689
those items so now we would use the key

284
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,180
generator

285
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,580
whether tis<font color="#E5E5E5"> the item or if you want to</font>

286
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,530
edit it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the fly and see if the</font>

287
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:31,960
application behaves differently adjusted

288
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:35,530
it so let's talk about evolution of our

289
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:39,490
sha also one of the important<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

290
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:41,500
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced and that was</font>

291
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,260
introduced in iOS 8 is the multi-factor

292
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,220
authentication so up until now we know

293
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:50,110
that all the items are so when you use

294
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,090
like one unlocked items only accessible

295
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,620
when the device is unlocked that means

296
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,930
that you enter your passcode your

297
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">device's unlock now all the key is</font>

298
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,890
related to those<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular items are</font>

299
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,560
available right now so that's why you

300
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:06,760
get those items decrypted however so

301
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce multi-factor</font>

302
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,000
authentication that means that you need

303
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:14,800
to have another layer of another layer

304
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,380
of our guarantee that you need to learn

305
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,439
the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hey this item can be</font>

306
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:24,189
decrypted and that is by either giving

307
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the device password or a touch ID so if</font>

308
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,850
you see them how if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> open your</font>

309
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,010
banking applications and everything it

310
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,350
asks for on another another

311
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:34,240
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> to later keep your budget</font>

312
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">itself is you fall back to the best</font>

313
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,550
possible so that is basically multipacks

314
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,069
of information and it's used by both the

315
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,660
teacher<font color="#CCCCCC"> no BS in the local</font>

316
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,340
occasionally and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

317
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">about local a complication again this</font>

318
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:52,050
stuff because that is it is only likely

319
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:55,670
related but it's still a good good topic

320
00:15:52,050 --> 00:16:00,240
to explore but that is not what I'm good

321
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:03,870
so n is 8 apart from<font color="#E5E5E5"> those accessibility</font>

322
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,480
constants of a very welcome change is

323
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,900
variation of when passport<font color="#CCCCCC"> said and what</font>

324
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,630
this basically means is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an item can</font>

325
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:16,079
only be stored in the kitchen if a user

326
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,790
has set a passcode on the device so we

327
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,790
have said users who do not use device

328
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:24,060
password they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not set wave as</font>

329
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,589
password so if you have like super

330
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,479
sensitive application like a banking

331
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:30,660
application on if the bank really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants</font>

332
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,310
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their application of</font>

333
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,650
their customers let I<font color="#CCCCCC"> secured they could</font>

334
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:37,500
use like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1password said that means that</font>

335
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:42,510
it forces the end user to actually use a

336
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:45,390
device password if if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the application</font>

337
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:47,100
from sure if the if the device parts

338
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Corp is room or after the application is</font>

339
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:53,760
installed on its mission then that I can

340
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,099
get my directed by default oh so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

341
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,020
the new accessibility constant and then

342
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,270
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this new attribute for access</font>

343
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,890
control and I just control is basically

344
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,369
what the multi-factor authentication is

345
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:08,810
so I gives more fine-grained control

346
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:11,669
over each item like when we decrypted so

347
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:13,980
vitamins no longer decrypted as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

348
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:17,130
our devices on rock you need to give a

349
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,560
secondary or authentication to it and

350
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,930
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said there was only one policy</font>

351
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,688
that was available at that time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

352
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">the user presence so user presences</font>

353
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:27,470
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they the</font>

354
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,820
device password opportunity

355
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:33,770
to further decrypt that pitch an actor

356
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:37,520
however in I a snide more policies were

357
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:39,379
added also in relation to user presence

358
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,110
you now have touch ID any or touch ID

359
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:46,700
parents it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a what touch ID in your</font>

360
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">concept mean is that so on an iOS device</font>

361
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,710
currently you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more than one set</font>

362
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,559
of fingerprints<font color="#E5E5E5"> android so i think the</font>

363
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,750
maximum it is fine right now so if you

364
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,090
have hid any that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could</font>

365
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:03,260
enroll or tea n roll the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fingerprints</font>

366
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:04,939
and it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a valid of valid said but</font>

367
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,620
if you use touch ID current self so

368
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,450
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you have three fingerprints</font>

369
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:12,559
enrolled at the time of the application

370
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:14,120
installation and if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a fourth</font>

371
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,080
finger print and roll after the

372
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:20,330
application is installed then that item

373
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,070
gets in violated because the parent said

374
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,949
would not is not matching with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

375
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:27,080
previous set so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it does is that</font>

376
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:30,830
it takes a hash of all the fingerprints

377
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:34,189
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three from difference oh and it</font>

378
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:37,039
checks for each time whenever that item

379
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,750
is being accessed and if that hash does

380
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,270
not much like if our finger dress be

381
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:45,200
enrolled or enter then that item gets

382
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:47,780
invalidated so that is useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lastly</font>

383
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,610
the device passcode oh so that means

384
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,289
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the if the phone is if the</font>

385
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,789
device is not supporting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pacioretty then</font>

386
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:55,879
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be fort lee pretty wise</font>

387
00:18:52,789 --> 00:19:00,640
passport on an hour and<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just the</font>

388
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:03,350
logical operators and then two important

389
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,230
additions are also the private key usage

390
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:09,049
and application password now private key

391
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,350
usage means that a particular item<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

392
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:15,090
is being stored inside

393
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:18,719
each attack will be used to basically

394
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign a sign you need anything you want</font>

395
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,860
to have some side later between the

396
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,900
device and the server between occupation

397
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,379
on the server you could specify<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

398
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:30,900
an item that data can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a as a</font>

399
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,600
sign in here you specify that by saying

400
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:36,840
that private key usage application

401
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">Palace one means that in order for for</font>

402
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,199
that item to be decrypted it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

403
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">your it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your device passcode</font>

404
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,090
of touch ID it also requires another

405
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,970
password that's that comes from your

406
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:53,250
application so that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in order</font>

407
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,380
for an item<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decrypt you need now you</font>

408
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,960
need to have two passwords one comes

409
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the application that could be like</font>

410
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,100
hard buried within the application are

411
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,260
like a good fetch from the server on the

412
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide and then your device password</font>

413
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:14,539
that's ready so yeah so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

414
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically all the changes that we have</font>

415
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:23,850
and so let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what basically</font>

416
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,510
all those access controls is and why is

417
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:29,760
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful so as if I'm tester you know</font>

418
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,250
that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an item</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over there and if</font>

419
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,379
you figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's being used as</font>

420
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,270
an application<font color="#E5E5E5"> passport then you want to</font>

421
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">go further investigate how that</font>

422
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:41,158
secondary password is coming a bit comes

423
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,960
from a if it's hardwired into the

424
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">application of minor itself so that's</font>

425
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,960
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the final process the good</font>

426
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,480
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fetch it on the fly from</font>

427
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">the server keep it in memory and then</font>

428
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">discredit as soon as it's used also for</font>

429
00:20:54,179 --> 00:21:00,380
things like that would you really want

430
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:02,840
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like how the developers actually</font>

431
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:05,010
actually

432
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,039
set the permissions to that particular

433
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:12,120
item<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in order to able to do that we</font>

434
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:16,650
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we need to understand what is a</font>

435
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:20,639
access control object so currently there

436
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:22,500
is no atl to to see that what so there

437
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,600
there is an idea to get the protections

438
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,970
of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> if what kind of protection it's</font>

439
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,770
being used but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no api to know</font>

440
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,500
what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of access control that item</font>

441
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:34,710
has over it so for that you have to do a

442
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,590
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of reversing and then</font>

443
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:40,140
understand like how this this access

444
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,959
control object is paying it so if you

445
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,360
see over here this is a simple query to

446
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,250
add an item to set a time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i takes an</font>

447
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,500
inquiry the prayer is a dictionary with

448
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,960
class set will generate password<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found</font>

449
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one hand service service name and</font>

450
00:21:51,960 --> 00:22:00,059
if you see over there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the access</font>

451
00:21:53,850 --> 00:22:03,809
control with a ACL is a is if it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

452
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:05,580
constant<font color="#CCCCCC"> over on the top of which is a</font>

453
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:08,220
written value of seconds is control

454
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,370
create with<font color="#E5E5E5"> flags so created flats takes</font>

455
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:14,440
two operations or one is the one is the

456
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:17,168
protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> accessibility constant it is</font>

457
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,450
and the next is actually return strength

458
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,190
or the policies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

459
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,460
earlier that's the user presence over

460
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:26,490
here so when all these gets into it gets

461
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,409
gets it gets built into the wedding<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

462
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:35,710
and then it's being added into the

463
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:37,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">keychain so let's see oh whatever what</font>

464
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,570
such are being taken when this

465
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:42,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">dictionary spill is being built so the</font>

466
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing we need to know is what</font>

467
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:46,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually like constant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acrs so the</font>

468
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,679
written value of this create with flags

469
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:53,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">is an option say access control so it's</font>

470
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:56,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">something you insert the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> options and I</font>

471
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:57,428
really likes with for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> only reason</font>

472
00:22:56,019 --> 00:23:00,070
that it gives you optional where it

473
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:03,519
means that a variable can have a value

474
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,710
or if for some reason that value fails

475
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:09,549
then the variable is by default set to

476
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:13,509
live and if you see that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> flip is a is</font>

477
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:16,330
like a unwrapping of that optional so oh

478
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:18,909
the code path is only followed if there

479
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:21,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a value in the ACA if there is not a</font>

480
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:23,350

481
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,770
is blocking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on print or further but</font>

482
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:28,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sexus control is an option</font>

483
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:30,600
value and what basically sec<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

484
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:35,220
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> is internally it's a structure</font>

485
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:37,469
but sassy structure with to various one

486
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,150
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> runtime based and the other one</font>

487
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:43,320
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dictionary so randomness is</font>

488
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:44,850
something something that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

489
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,919
thing that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really care about is the</font>

490
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:50,250
lectionary because that is where all the

491
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:53,370
transitions are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> set so the first</font>

492
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:55,470
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> of when that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> API is for a user</font>

493

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,410
it creates memories intentionally and

497
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the second call is immediately went to</font>

498
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,060
the set protection the set protection is

499
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:13,379
just at the one is the accessible by my

500
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,970
blog so now when you access the is the

501
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,620
structure that it's rated side it you

502
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:20,880
will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the protection over here</font>

503
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:24,810
is set to<font color="#CCCCCC"> AK which is when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Allah and</font>

504
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,510
then the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is that to create a a</font>

505
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:30,990
sub dictionary within that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bigger</font>

506
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:33,840
dictionary and this sub dictionary is

507
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,000
actually the ACL value you can see over

508
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,679
here from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there only be if you dump that</font>

509
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,230
particular memory address for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that big</font>

510
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,120
smelly you see that ACL is a second

511
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:47,340
secondary dictionary inside every

512
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:49,889
dictionary and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ASEAN I college</font>

513
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,780
main again<font color="#E5E5E5"> two beautiful constraints or</font>

514
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">double constraints of his friends</font>

515
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,160
friends are whatever the flags that we

516
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,990
human at the user level whether it's a

517
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">user presence for now so now we have</font>

518
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,659
addiction inside a dictionary that

519
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:06,590
and we'll see how the page<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACR gets</font>

520
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:08,179
better and so like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> sell flags</font>

521
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,570
determine the overall structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

522
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:13,640
ACL dictionary and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows of policy is</font>

523
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,039
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> specified that is like if you just</font>

524
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:19,130
fasten mill instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the user presence</font>

525
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:21,590
of the top then the default ACL is set

526
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,150
so the default ACL means that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

527
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:26,480
no access control on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular</font>

528
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:30,049
vector so you see Vinny Mac's is the

529
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,179
dictionary<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will see that the the ACL</font>

530
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:34,400
dictionary will have a de sel which is

531
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:39,770
the default access control list and set

532
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:41,630
to boolean value<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 that means that no</font>

533
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:45,139
access control policies are set on it

534
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:47,419
however if a user user presence policy

535
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:50,900
is specified then we get free built in

536
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:55,340
operation set for the side and the new

537
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:59,750
items are the OD hotel and OD OD what

538
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:01,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">cody is this that is so we'll take a</font>

539
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,789
step back and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> understand what</font>

540
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:08,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">these operations are basically an</font>

541
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:10,820
operation is is basically like what kind

542
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,100
of an action can be performed performed

543
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:16,220
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular vector so that means</font>

544
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:19,719
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see Bodie is off decrypt so</font>

545
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:22,669
that means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> an item can be decrypted</font>

546
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">odense an item can be deleted also that</font>

547
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:27,350
is the operation that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> performed</font>

548
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:31,010
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that item and OE means that an item</font>

549
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:33,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be encrypted as well and then for</font>

550
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:37,820
privately you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see oxide and op</font>

551
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:40,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">sink is for op Singh is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used for iCloud</font>

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:43,780
sharing i<font color="#E5E5E5"> clogged kitchen which is not</font>

553
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,780
used at present yet

554
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,750
so now if you see over here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

555
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:54,920
dictionary will see that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Goldie</font>

556
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:57,170
Odin OE hotel and olya by default set to

557
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,270
true because like every item is

558
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:01,130
encrypted by default right so whenever

559
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,530
the device gets unlocked by<font color="#E5E5E5"> default it</font>

560
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,540
just encrypted so that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the true</font>

561
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,940
and any anthem should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to be</font>

562
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:11,389
deleted<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again the operation on that</font>

563
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:13,370
item is like totally is settled but the

564
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,830
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing over here is that when</font>

565
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,810
an item gets decrypted so it means to me

566
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:20,600
only decrypted by based on a set of

567
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:23,060
constraints that were specified and the

568
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,580
constraint over here is that the CEO is

569
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:27,320
basically the user presence constraint

570
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,300
which is set to devise owner

571
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:34,310
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that means that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

572
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:37,129
can either specify device password or

573
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:39,580
you could specify<font color="#E5E5E5"> hid your you will be</font>

574
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">prompted with any of one of those um</font>

575
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:45,350
instead of user presence if you have

576
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:49,840
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> HIV current or touch ID any you</font>

577
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:52,070
will have a different different set of

578
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,860
constraint mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here in order</font>

579
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:57,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to decrypt that item and similarly you</font>

580
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:00,740
will see for private key usage as well

581
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,450
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that there is the mapping</font>

582
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,240
between these operations and the

583
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">constraints that are being set oh and</font>

584
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,090
that mapping is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> like when you</font>

585
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,210
mention

586
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:15,149
an item when you give an access ACL

587
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:17,010
to an icon as like a user presence

588
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,870
device password natural energetic

589
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,370
current set my default you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will have</font>

590
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:22,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">these three operations on a particular</font>

591
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,899
item these three operations are set on

592
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> item so that means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as a</font>

593
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,640
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> researcher if you see these</font>

594
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">three items you would be sure that this</font>

595
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,080
item<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being is not being used for an</font>

private<font color="#E5E5E5"> key usage but it is being used</font>

597
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">for one of those four above-mentioned</font>

598
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:44,250
things and going further if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

599
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,080
further<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the dictionary will know for</font>

600
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,420
sure that which of the constraint that

601
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,919
is being set on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> device so if it's a</font>

602
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:53,340
CP ER than you know that it's a user

603
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:57,450
presence so as an appendix where you

604
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,389
will know that yes we have we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have used</font>

605
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a presence at as an easier for this</font>

606
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:09,720
um luckily for me I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

607
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,880
some documentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of and luckily there</font>

608
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,760
were some undocumented apx for me so

609
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,010
which from swifty but just call them<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

610
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,740
what you need to do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of casting</font>

611
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:23,640
and if you do like cell access control

612
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:26,970
gate constraints and then you cast a CL

613
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,280
OS x axis controller object take the

614
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:32,250
unwritten value and then again cast it

615
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,770
as a dictionary then you the the

616
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,900
constraint over this a variable you have

617
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,240
addiction to be like this so now I could

618
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:43,250
use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Swift dictionary to manipulate</font>

619
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">this dictionary and access</font>

620
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:52,670
the key value thing oh so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

621
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:55,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to understand what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lineman line is</font>

622
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:59,300
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a CL by default comes</font>

623
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:03,320
and as a sec access control reference

624
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:06,560
also that's still an object but the !

625
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:10,370
over this is that there is a valuing a

626
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:13,250
sealed so since its site access control

627
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:17,030
gates constraints is a see as a c

628
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:18,680
function we cannot pass into it and for

629
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,690
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to say it but we</font>

630
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:24,010
need to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> Swift that there is a value</font>

631
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:27,080
you can go all this with the c function

632
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:30,770
and they unwritten<font color="#CCCCCC"> values anything to do</font>

633
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:37,669
with the art of the memory management

634
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:39,920
stuff so what this means is that so the

635
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:42,380
object the<font color="#E5E5E5"> asean object is being</font>

636
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,950
accessed over here but once this

637
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,570
operation completes then the pointer so

638
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,090
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how the memory management works</font>

639
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,040
right so you have if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number</font>

640
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:54,169
of pointers then you have a power<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it</font>

641
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:58,670
so if you have the five pointers<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

642
00:30:54,170 --> 00:31:00,620
have a 55 home to it and once the once

643
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:03,710
you go through the free function then

644
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:06,820
those found get dick and those down get

645
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:09,670
decreased 20 once it gets to zero then

646
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:12,409
that memory allocation is free forever

647
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:15,260
so what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> come reading value does is</font>

648
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:17,540
that even though there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point to</font>

649
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:20,360
remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it it does not decrease the</font>

650
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:22,850
count of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> knocked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out yet this is</font>

651
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,979
important because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when this function the</font>

652
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:27,250
it's written inside a function in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

653
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:30,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">fence or when that function exists</font>

654
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:35,420
automatically<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee differences but for</font>

655
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:39,260
their ACL object so if if I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font>

656
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:41,900
if I depend on Swift to take care of

657
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:46,010
freeing the object I need to do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

658
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:48,530
unwritten value if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to free an</font>

659
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:50,440
object myself than I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> retain</font>

660
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:52,970
value<font color="#E5E5E5"> which automatically freeze the</font>

661
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,450
object over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally a casters</font>

662
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:58,790
as a swift dictionary so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will be</font>

663
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:05,450
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> book it by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing like a key</font>

664
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:07,850
value so so that's basically about

665
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:11,270
psychiatrist moonful object now we know

666
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:12,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we have a dictionary and based on</font>

667
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:15,710
that dictionary we can map out what

668
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:21,310
constraints that that the item was

669
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:24,770
originally safe as and key generator I'm

670
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:27,470
technically not introducing<font color="#CCCCCC"> because this</font>

671
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:31,490
has already been released and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

672
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:33,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">some- page also have a blog post</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

673
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,840
but the main features are that this

674
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:38,870
would provide you<font color="#CCCCCC"> too you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dump the</font>

675
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,919
riveter edit delete a each an item<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

676
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:45,919
supports very well is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tangible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

677
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,410
integrates with ID be so I db's at all

678
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,350
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys not already know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

679
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,750
static analysis tool

680
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:56,889
written by my colleague for basically

681
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:59,380
doing I'm expand testing also the usage

682
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:02,679
is that you have a detailed of<font color="#CCCCCC"> health</font>

683
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:05,049
and I were to use and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just show a</font>

684
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,179
quick demo later on but some important

685
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:09,668
functions are over here is that the

686
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:15,160
action will will either take like min de

687
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:18,580
combate de some minimum notes of when I

688
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,960
used to dependence thing I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> I most</font>

689
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,449
of the times<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do not from the I found</font>

690
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,630
him on the surface name of a particular

691
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:27,820
item<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for so in order</font>

692
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:30,520
for that I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dump the whole agent</font>

693
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:33,129
but if i turn the whole kitchen it's

694
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,408
basically like this with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff</font>

695
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:37,600
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to go through each</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font>

696
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:39,340
them but instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I did is</font>

697
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,840
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just display that on hand surg</font>

698
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,330
listening so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a meaning it up</font>

699
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,639
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be a short list and you</font>

700
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:47,710
would quickly go through what

701
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:52,500
application you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it and</font>

702
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:54,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">you get the you get the full reverse</font>

703
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,100
reverse name of it so something like

704
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:59,620
comrade face after their faces if you're

705
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,879
looking at some application you'll have

706
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:06,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">calmed or convenient or application oh</font>

707
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,070
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> min done and the other feature</font>

708
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:11,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking about is the search</font>

709
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:14,530
functionality within the term so search

710
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:16,299
is basically contains operator on<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmmm</font>

711
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:19,359
service name access group and access to

712
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">the constants so that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can</font>

713
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,460
specify action and stuff and then you

714
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:27,609
say you only let's say only want to find

715
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,520
a list of women block diagrams and you

716
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:33,060
just do find when Allah

717
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get items that use when I'm locked</font>

718
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:39,540
as I accessibility constant so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's</font>

719
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:40,919
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> just three 3i times so likewise you</font>

720
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,110
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just search for i hope you my</font>

721
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:46,230
service name and you'll just get a short

722
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:49,110
list of that no need<font color="#E5E5E5"> for everything and</font>

723
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:51,179
I got a pull request saying that I need

724
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:55,350
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x vampires but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm planning</font>

725
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:58,650
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to do that something also this</font>

726
00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:02,100
teacher named<font color="#E5E5E5"> Victor is like 6am months</font>

727
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:06,390
old and already wrote this one I said

728
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:10,380
was amazing at that point of man so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

729
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:12,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I only use a presence was only only</font>

730
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy or constraint that was available</font>

731
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:17,100
so i just use a boolean value whether

732
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,859
that item has access that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> trick on</font>

733
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:26,549
accessibility so the access<font color="#E5E5E5"> control or</font>

734
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:30,270
not but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just say no aureus and it it</font>

735
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:31,950
as again like i said<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

736
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:36,000
to edit a particular kitchen item then

737
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:39,359
you use the Edit action however<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

738
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,070
whole thing to note that since<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

739
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:45,150
database<font color="#CCCCCC"> and item needs to be identified</font>

740
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:47,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">unique and the way that an item is being</font>

741
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,920
identified is using a 3 pupil of a

742
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,830
condom<font color="#E5E5E5"> service name and access group so</font>

743
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,750
these are using this three pieces of

744
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:57,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">information you guarantee that an item</font>

745
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:59,910
is unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> however access group is not</font>

746
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:02,220
required all the times it is only

747
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:05,310
required when let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you are dealing</font>

748
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:08,970
with ND stuff and then some names are

749
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:12,120
complicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so what that means is</font>

750
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:14,279
that when you are dealing with MDM you

751
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,089
will have a duplicate period of service

752
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,719
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

753
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:25,319
I'm confident services so one instance

754
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:28,739
that I'm at her face was so the RSA is a

755
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:30,660
by default gives you an RSA library but

756
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:33,019
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this MDM solution where it</font>

757
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,759
would also install its own RSA library

758
00:36:33,019 --> 00:36:38,788
it's the same piece of RSA library but

759
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:41,309
MDM uses that is a library<font color="#E5E5E5"> compile</font>

760
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:44,609
statically so it gets installed and that

761
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:48,660
RSA library stores in kitchen item again

762
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:50,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">onto the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kitchen but since the lamb</font>

763
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,489
diems access group is different from

764
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:55,559
that of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ious operating system you</font>

765
00:36:53,489 --> 00:36:58,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to have like a three people do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

766
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:01,469
get a differentiated version of it which

767
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,849
item you're actually poking at if you

768
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:05,249
know for sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not dealing</font>

769
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:06,809
with MDM stuff then you you're just

770
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:08,249
parented with that found remnants are

771
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:11,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">listening that your second will be</font>

772
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:13,828
unique and right now I only accept

773
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,930
basics before infrared data because I

774
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:19,289
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to lose any form of</font>

775
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:23,969
information when entering because there

776
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:26,519
are a lot of physical to enter<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

777
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:28,799
might create the pool<font color="#CCCCCC"> work just break</font>

778
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:33,149
the encoding format when it's inserted

779
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:35,819
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room oh and then finally to</font>

780
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:38,069
relate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same uniqueness to ad</font>

781
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:40,109
infinitum uniquely the same thing

782
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:42,329
applies over here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that the</font>

783
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:44,190
argument you're passing is one less of

784
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:46,640
it you don't pass any data argument you

785
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,640
just us

786
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:53,939
and this is the ideal tool that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am</font>

787
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:58,130
showing us so this gives like a sweet

788
00:37:53,940 --> 00:38:01,890
honey GUI interface and the kitchen is

789
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:04,680
integrated with the itbs work so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

790
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:07,560
put it on your computer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

791
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,089
hit done kitchen it will call my tool it

792
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:15,470
dumps the kitchen and then you have like

793
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:17,550
delete or really buttons as well and

794
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:21,359
today i would like to also introduced

795
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:23,670
each anyway it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the same tool but</font>

796
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:26,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">i just wanted to learn Swift and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

797
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:29,280
wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> write the GUI</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> f for it I just</font>

798
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:31,950
heard a small UI application I also know

799
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,680
we have used<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my close friends to</font>

800
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:36,779
help bread that you I us stuff that

801
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,480
really don't care about when he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

802
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:45,960
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mock me he had a pink tab at</font>

803
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:48,540
the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> word so it's again a similar set</font>

804
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,670
of things that it does liquid search for

805
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,380
a condom serviceman and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> dumped or</font>

806
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,030
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't give any of it than</font>

807
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:58,170
absolute list of things would<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just</font>

808
00:38:54,030 --> 00:39:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">done so something like the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. not</font>

809
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty and just getting there but so</font>

810
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,940
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is since this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stephen am I think</font>

811
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,900
these creatures are from bias emulator

812
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:14,510
so all the

813
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:17,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">are so there are only three items for</font>

814
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:19,789
this purpose and when you click on one

815
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:23,869
of the economy service in America then

816
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:27,289
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a full list of items and so</font>

817
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:29,450
you see their protection the only

818
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:31,460
problem and then there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a degree but</font>

819
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:35,868
not about and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have an edit</font>

820
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:37,849
button at bottom but it'd be nice Oh the

821
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:41,359
only problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me right now is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

822
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:44,329
couldn't integrate the access control

825
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:53,990
with so I lights web Swift works really

826
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:56,599
fast it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to write but it's not</font>

827
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:59,750
complete yet and it brings a lot of

828
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:01,880
problems when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you eat with the bridging</font>

829
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,619
headers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have since I'm dealing</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> like undocumented see functions it</font>

831
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:09,799
it's giving me a few errors here in

832
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,900
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not really stable</font>

833
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:14,210
right hand side I want to understand how

834
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:17,029
swift works how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Swift's memory</font>

835
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:19,400
management works like I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> telling</font>

earlier that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> convenient value was one</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">then and then I'll just have access</font>

constraint that item has on so yeah

844
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:46,359
those are the dunes obviously the front

00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:19,749
and unite passwords and certificates as

856
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:22,869
40 again our I estate onwards there is I

857
00:41:19,749 --> 00:41:25,209
club<font color="#E5E5E5"> Egypt so the web sharing where the</font>

858
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:28,539
kitchen items get synchronized across

859
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:30,910
all your devices that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is well that is</font>

860
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:36,339
something that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to work on on my</font>

861
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:38,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 and in general I would want to go</font>

862
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:41,140
deep in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ask each and stack itself</font>

863
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,720
those are like badly and I showed you

864
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:47,879
the architecture of how the how the

865
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:51,160
kitchen works and something to workers

866
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">towards securing them how the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> code</font>

867
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:57,160
path goes into secure Enclave cover each

868
00:41:53,739 --> 00:41:59,859
and hundreds of sword so one thing so if

869
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,779
you were in David should stock so David

870
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:05,950
was telling that it's not totally clear

871
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:07,780
like weather and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual item</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dixon</font>

872
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">cryptid or the metadata for that item</font>

873
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:12,849
gets encrypted from my experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

874
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:16,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the manner that gets</font>

875
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:21,369
encrypted because this is only<font color="#E5E5E5"> for each</font>

876
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:24,040
and said so remember that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said that</font>

877
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:26,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">when when passcode said you didn't win</font>

878

879
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:30,010
accessibility constant and if you remove

880
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,680
the device password later after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

881
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:36,099
application will store then the then

882
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:38,440
that item gets invalidated by default it

883
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:42,010
gets deleted but that's what document

884
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:45,339
says but in practice if you still also

885
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:49,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you dump that item the item would not</font>

886
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:50,710
show fine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> command</font>

887
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,240
line tool and if you try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> delete that</font>

888
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:54,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">written than that I can gets deleted</font>

889
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,859
that is that is the point when that item

890
00:42:54,369 --> 00:43:03,640
gets delayed so when I beg a little bit

891
00:42:56,859 --> 00:43:07,930
of understood that since a lot of

892
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:10,779
properties are added to form a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hfs+ file</font>

893
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:14,230
system that is what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses there</font>

894
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:15,520
is a there is a new attribute not some

895
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,960
new attribute it's been there for a

896
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,359
while the attribute basically specifies

897
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,020
that whether an item is accessible to

898
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:25,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">the user of month so when the key gets</font>

899
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:28,290
gets thrown away then that particular

900
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:31,210
item<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I said to</font>

901
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:33,339
unavailable so you never present it with

902
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:35,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I can but it's still there in that</font>

903
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:38,450
memory it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to date in the</font>

904
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:40,609
and when I force it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> delete it then</font>

905
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:43,368
that particular item gets deleted that

906
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:46,190
is one it is really so interesting stuff

907
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:49,700
like this so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> dig deeper in</font>

908
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:53,119
debt if you're interested in me and if

909
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:55,970
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool and if you if you</font>

910
00:43:53,119 --> 00:44:05,690
encounter is these file issues on guitar

911
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:14,660
and happy understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll take any</font>

912
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:18,530
questions you took any work on Wi-Fi or

913
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:21,109
keychain of realizing for the tune or in

914
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:24,619
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in general so it does it</font>

915
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:28,640
just sync the file is the yes my dear is

916
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:31,369
it does addressing the file across all

917
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,450
your devices the only exception is that

918
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:34,450
if you see

919
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:43,890
the only exception is one that left our

920
00:44:41,939 --> 00:44:46,499
accessibility constant is said to this

921
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:48,359
device only that it would not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sing</font>

922
00:44:46,499 --> 00:44:51,749
across devices or it would not get back

923
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:54,119
up back up so each accessibility

924
00:44:51,749 --> 00:44:56,729
constant will have its own set of keys

925
00:44:54,119 --> 00:45:00,149
cryptographic keys for it and this

926
00:44:56,729 --> 00:45:03,299
device only a banking is only<font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

927
00:45:00,149 --> 00:45:06,390
within that device so for some reason of

928
00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:10,579
that but he is<font color="#CCCCCC"> less</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

929
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:10,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">us forever so yeah</font>

930
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:20,009
all right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys thanks for</font>
