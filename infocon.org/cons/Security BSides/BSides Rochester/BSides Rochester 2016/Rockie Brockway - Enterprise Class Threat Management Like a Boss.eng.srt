00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:11,160
thanks I'll early for coming and thanks

2
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:13,019
beside Rochester I'm quick show of hands

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,839
I did a talk last year at besides

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,609
Rochester very similarly themed called

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,800
enterprise-class vulnerability

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:25,470
management like a boss anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit in on</font>

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:29,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one cool so the first couple of</font>

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,929
slides might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look at you first</font>

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,649
couple of slides might be a little bit

10
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:38,370
repetitive just going over kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of why</font>

11
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,510
we're here and then basically content

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,320
about enterprise security<font color="#CCCCCC"> architecture</font>

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:49,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what it does so real quick I'm rocky</font>

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,690
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long time I also</font>

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,920
organized besides Cleveland which is

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming up in June I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pentest I do risk</font>

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,879
assessment enterprise security

18
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:04,830
architecture we do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of purple team</font>

19
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,539
stuff so our attacking knowledge kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,360
like you know gets distributed over to

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,159
the blue team's looking for doing really

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,799
specific advanced adversary type tactics

23
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,570
and this is really kind of a product<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,950
byproduct of what some of the stuff that

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,199
I've been working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on with our clients</font>

26
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:24,020
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple years at this point</font>

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,740
and so from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a history lesson perspective</font>

28
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:33,210
in 2007 this guy here Gunnar Peterson

29
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:35,280
who's really smart so look him up he and

30
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">his the organization that he was with at</font>

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,930
the time put<font color="#E5E5E5"> together this paper called</font>

00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:48,090
for a security we all know what Moore's

34
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,970
Law is right so for a security document

35
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:55,490
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> as relative as it is today almost</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago that says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something the</font>

37
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,500
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an illustration of</font>

38
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,890
where we are today and there's some

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,140
problems going on right the information

40
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,449
is beautiful you know

41
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,660
net site world's<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest data breaches</font>

42
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:14,179
we updated this are they updated if very

43
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,010
recently so now we've got even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the voter</font>

giant the other side of the slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

46
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:26,120
the on the right hand side of the slide

53
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:51,530
an uptick so that tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

54
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,850
something from we're spending a lot of

00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:59,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">money and we're still getting breached</font>

56
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:59,200
right the way I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> got your question</font>

57
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,760
no no we're spending more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money and</font>

58
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,760
we're continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give anymore</font>

59
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,208
reporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a I mean that absolutely could</font>

60
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,920
have you know that could that could skew

61
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:25,700
the numbers in you know some way shape

62
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,250
or form absolutely but realistically

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,459
from my perspective and having been

64
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this a couple of decades</font>

65
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,970
organizations really understand that

66
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">protecting business critical data is</font>

67
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,560
crucial to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business right but</font>

68
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,880
they're typically looking at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from two</font>

69
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,340
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both of those ways are really</font>

70
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,530
going to flawed fundamentally the first

71
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,570
is from a project-by-project basis right

72
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,989
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a new firewall we need to</font>

73
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:53,060
upgrade the VPNs etc there's no business

74
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:55,250
need there's no strategy behind any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

75
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,130
that stuff it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just okay you know we're</font>

76
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:01,610
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is the natural course of</font>

77
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:04,010
our professional lives right the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

78
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,130
way is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a compliance perspective</font>

79
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:10,060
right organizations are basing their

80
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,680
security programs on compliance which on

81
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:16,980
one hand does kind of make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense because</font>

82
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:20,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you are found in not complying</font>

83
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:28,590
with some type of regulatory mandate

84
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:30,989
what happens so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there go to deal with</font>

85
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,479
that agency or that client<font color="#E5E5E5"> or that</font>

86
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,550
turkey<font color="#CCCCCC"> come from sure sure all right so</font>

87
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,440
sodium you know this gentleman right

88
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,670
here said you lose the ability to work

89
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,710
with you know let's say the

90
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,020
organizations that require you to comply

91
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,310
etc that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely true that is a</font>

92
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,219
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact the second business</font>

93
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">impact is somebody back there said fine</font>

94
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,360
thank you right so we have it so that it

95
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,550
does kind of make sense that

96
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,230
organizations are basing their their

97
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,270
security programs around compliance

98
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:01,290
because there are there are business

99
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:03,960
impacts but all the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> nerds like</font>

100
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,630
me have historically said this for years

101
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,640
at this point right and beating a dead

102
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,190
horse I can't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to have</font>

103
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,260
to drink just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying it if you're if</font>

104
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:17,460
you're compliant you're probably not

105
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:20,400
secure but if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure you're also</font>

106
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be compliant to whatever</font>

107
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,030
framework you you have to be compliant

108
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:29,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">with right so again this is really just</font>

109
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of history of you know before we</font>

110
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,380
actually get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the threat management</font>

111
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,179
portion of this right complexity<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

112
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,260
enterprises are complex and you

113
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,120
therefore to solve the complexity issue

114
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,039
not just with information security but

115
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,080
you know complexity in general of

116
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,760
organizations of businesses right we

117
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,460
need some type of architecture and

118
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,219
that's where the enterprise security

119
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,430
architecture concept comes into play in

120
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,440
relation to enterprise security and

121
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,200
protecting business critical data right

122
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can break</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it down very simply</font>

123
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,120
right you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have</font>

124
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,340
organizational goals we need to

125
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,870
understand and take into consideration

126
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,570
the environment where these systems are

127
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,070
being built<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the technical</font>

128
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,210
capabilities required to build and

129
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,550
operate those systems that's

130
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,210
architecture at its most broken down

131
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,360
right and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to organize</font>

132
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,159
complexity right again you know

133
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,169
I'm sure everybody in here has also

134
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:35,180
heard the phrase<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you know if the</font>

135
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:37,430
more complex a system is anyone thank

136
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,620
you right the less secure it is so we

137
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,270
need to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely on architecture to</font>

138
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,370
organize the complexity of large

139
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,849
enterprises right benefits you know you

140
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,889
can read but you know again one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

141
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:51,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that I am going to focus on here</font>

142
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:53,930
is one of the areas that most

143
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,060
organizations just fail miserably at and

144
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,699
that's metrics right but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

145
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because that's how we on the</font>

technical whether it's IT or is Right

147
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:04,520
whether whether you're in you know

148
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,099
system administration or actual you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,198
security roles within your organization

150
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:11,449
that's how we communicate back up into

151
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">the business right our business leader</font>

152
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:16,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the CIO should not be the technical</font>

153
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:17,870
experts but you can argue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right but</font>

154
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:20,689
typically are not going to be the are

155
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,759
the technical experts to understand

156
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,830
exactly what you're trying to tell them

157
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you're the technical expert</font>

158
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,628
right and so we need to we need to

159
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,589
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> get better at communicating back</font>

160
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:37,159
into the business volumetrics so at its

161
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:41,270
basic at its basic kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of form right</font>

162
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:44,029
this is the overarching blueprint laid

163
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:47,240
out by that 2007 paper by Gunnar

164
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:52,430
Peterson you know and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> his associates</font>

165
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:55,129
and and again I this is so relevant

166
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,169
right understand the stakeholder goals

167
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:58,849
and now within the enterprise security

168
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,948
architecture needed risk management

169
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:03,110
policy and standards and actual design

170
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:06,919
and security architecture those three

171
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,900
pillars are supported by process defense

172
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,729
in depth and metrics on the process I

173
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,758
don't know house

174
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:14,909
sdlc right so application lifecycle etc

175
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,930
you have identity management

176
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:19,240
vulnerability management and threat

177
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,240
management defensive that is typically

178
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,210
what we consider what we normally are

179
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,559
talking about when we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

180
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,998
right these are the firewalls this is

181
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:29,949
the antivirus this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that</font>

182
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:32,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">all your controls that's your defense in</font>

183
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:35,370
depth right and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already talked</font>

184
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:40,120
about metrics which were hopeful that so

185
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:43,149
this talk is specifically on threat

186
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,769
management right and so what does threat

187
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:49,500
management means so we're breaking this

188
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:53,490
down into typical components including

189
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:56,709
your controls and you're logging sources

190
00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:00,850
monitoring threat my threat modeling

191
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:04,479
right incident response and then don't

192
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:06,269
shoot me threat intelligence again

193
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,579
that's getting you know one of the

194
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:14,709
another example of an you know silly

195
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:16,269
buzzword that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody Norse is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

196
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:19,540
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of laughs you know what</font>

197
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:21,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know where I'm talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

198
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,420
here we go right this is the threat

199
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:28,839
management process of the enterprise

200
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,910
security architecture now what are the

201
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,620
challenges here mm-hmm I already brought

202
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,399
up Moore's<font color="#E5E5E5"> law right and that applies</font>

203
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:38,199
the malware right so already for the

204
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,730
most part the blue team errs are you

205
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:42,069
know historically always going to be

206
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:47,639
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the curve right just based on</font>

207
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:50,500
moore's law right but we have excuse me

208
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:52,660
so the challenges around intelligence

209
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,160
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so effectively knowing you know</font>

210
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,769
having knowledge of those latest types

211
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,350
of attacks and trends communication

212
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:02,620
right when you get into enterprise

213
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:05,769
incident response<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right your</font>

214
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,269
organization is more than likely if you

215
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:09,010
know I'm and again i'm talking

216
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:10,630
enterprise you know level large

217
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,449
organizations broken up into many

218
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:16,149
business units<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if there is a</font>

219
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">breach somewhere that is going to affect</font>

220
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,800
multiple business units how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

221
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,880
communicating throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

222
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,979
organization to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

223
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,560
people who are accountable for that

224
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,180
responding accordingly and collectively

225
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,880
contributing to the incident response

226
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,880
program right so communication is a

227
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,600
giant giant problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> coordination is</font>

228
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:40,300
really you know the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> step and the</font>

229
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,340
next challenge their accountability and

230
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:46,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">I already talked about metrics and</font>

231
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:48,370
talent right the security economics<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

232
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,530
earlier this morning was talking about

233
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,110
you know the zero unemployment I've

234
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,550
heard negative negative unemployment in

235
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,850
the information security you know

236
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">community or actually that's just you</font>

237
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,360
know cross industries right but

238
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,550
specifically with information security

239
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,820
negative unemployment I don't know the

240
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,920
numbers but based on based on how you

241
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,560
know how hard it is that I've seen to

242
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,870
actually attract and keep awesome talent

243
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,099
I believe it all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't I don't</font>

244
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:21,700
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's not you know not true</font>

245
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:24,580
was that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have that right</font>

246
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,310
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because i mean</font>

247
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,340
i've been i've been doing this 23 24

248
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:34,420
years not everybody in here has right

249
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:36,100
and I sucked at some point you know I'm

250
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:40,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">also that that statement also assumes</font>

251
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:43,180
that I'm good now so I'm that could be

252
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:46,300
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> my subjective view of my own</font>

253
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,589
security town but so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

254
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,599
important one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these other more</font>

255
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:53,770
important things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to deal</font>

256
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">with here is I read a report that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

257
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:59,079
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> flying I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a came across this</font>

258
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,780
report as a census Sen<font color="#E5E5E5"> si GE 2012 report</font>

259
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,700
that showed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the massive and mostly</font>

260
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,770
manual efforts of collecting and

261
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,190
analyzing security data has caused a

262
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,600
severe downturn in both the mood of

263
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:13,410
security teams as well as the perception

264
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,420
of their effectiveness by stakeholders

265
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:19,480
now I'd psyched that report but it's a

266
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,719
dead link somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> read somebody wrote</font>

267
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,860
that report and then reviewed it and

268
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,740
made that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment which I thought was</font>

269
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:35,200
hilarious<font color="#E5E5E5"> and probably very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very scarily</font>

270
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:42,630
true but there's no life so many yeah it

271
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:46,150
was so right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so that you know that</font>

272
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:50,260
that entire process I mean this

273
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:52,959
immediately came to mind right if you

274
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:57,430
I've seen things you people wouldn't

275
00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:02,500
believe and if anybody doesn't know that

276
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">movie you there's the door</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

277
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,020
moving on up<font color="#E5E5E5"> management goals right</font>

278
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,240
here's what we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to accomplish</font>

279
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,790
within a mature threat management

280
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,430
process for our enterprise security

281
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,079
architecture we want improved

282
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,030
intelligence for quicker<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision-making</font>

283
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">all a lot of this is really kind of you</font>

284
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:24,610
know but you know buy-in from all

285
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,040
service owners and stakeholders is

286
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:30,010
critical especially when we get into

287
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,540
incident response right integration of

288
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,970
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing vulnerability management</font>

289
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,630
process because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two are really</font>

290
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:40,390
aligned in ways that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you need</font>

291
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:43,630
to have you can't just rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mature</font>

threat management process you really

294
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:50,980
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have these two aligned and</font>

00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:07,000
characteristic of this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really why</font>

300
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:08,830
most good most good penetration testing

301
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,470
teams are<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving towards that hybrid</font>

302
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,870
model right that purple team testing

303
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,640
where the red team is the attacking team

304
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,410
and the blue team is the defender team

305
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,900
but the engagements are really more of a

306
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:22,569
hybrid<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue team is watching the red</font>

307
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,819
team as they're attacking right the

308
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,400
creative juices start to flow they begin

309
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,620
to see advanced tactics that they may

310
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,530
not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever considered or may not have</font>

311
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,120
ever seen and are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to</font>

312
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,760
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about well how can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I detect that</font>

313
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,220
better or how can I react to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

314
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,430
alright so this type of hybrid model is

315
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:45,570
really geared towards improving

316
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:49,829
the detection in reaction times threat

317
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,820
prioritization<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so for example I</font>

318
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of get into this in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> detail</font>

319
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,529
but you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a malware</font>

320
00:14:52,470 --> 00:15:00,660
outbreak and it's affecting eight people

321
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:03,209
so far that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about but one of</font>

322
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:08,160
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people happens to be your senior</font>

324
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,670
everything that he can access is

325
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:17,339
breached<font color="#E5E5E5"> that poses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a significant risk</font>

326
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:21,329
to the organization for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the theft of</font>

327
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:23,910
intellectual property but it's only

00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:27,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight instances within let's say a</font>

329
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:30,060
10,000 staffed enterprise how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

330
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,820
prioritize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so there needs</font>

331
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:35,790
to be a threat prioritization model and

332
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:39,660
standard as a part of the threat

333
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:43,199
management process itself mm-hmm it's a

334
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,430
response maturity and then service over

335
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,000
and stakeholder reporting with the

336
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:50,040
metrics so here's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years ago</font>

337
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I started thinking about this is</font>

338
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,699
anybody familiar with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP</font>

00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:57,420

standard a couple people<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the latest</font>

341
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:06,839

342
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:11,160
version 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the ASV s 2014 this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

345
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:21,690
really quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as opposed to the</font>

346
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,890
OWASP top 20 a SVS is actually

347
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:29,720
implementable the OAuth top 20 tends to

348
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:34,189
be just muddled you know

349
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,529
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so at the very so this is</font>

350
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:39,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ASV s a very very high</font>

level overview of what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in relation</font>

352
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">to what it was originally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intended to be</font>

353
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,779
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a software development</font>

354
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:48,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifecycle kind of process or set of</font>

355
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:50,689
processes and what we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

356
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:52,879
then apply this model to threat

357
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:53,990
management this is what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did last year</font>

358
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,509
when I applied this model to

359
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,610
vulnerability management and it seemed

360
00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:00,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed to work pretty well and so I</font>

361
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,740
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well I can maybe I can reduce</font>

362
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:05,539
the amount of time I I needed to create

363
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,079
a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation and just apply this</font>

364
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:11,179
to fret management so that's what I did

365
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,948
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ASV s is really</font>

366
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:14,000
there's not a lot going on or there's

367
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,620
nothing structure within your

368
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,150
organization we're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

369
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,339
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to focus on that</font>

370
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,459
whatsoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right that's just okay</font>

371
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:24,889
you're you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on right level one</font>

372
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:28,510
it's called opportunity from an

373
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:31,340
application perspective that means that

374
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,950
the application can adequately defend

375
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,090
itself against application security

376
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,640
vulnerabilities that are easy to

377
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:40,490
discover<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so at a high level we'll</font>

378
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,400
just kind of leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that level to a</font>

379
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,929
standard right the application can

380
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,340
adequately defend itself against

381
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:48,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">prevalent application security</font>

382
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,320
vulnerabilities of moderate to serious

383
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:53,870
risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great so we're beginning to</font>

384
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,960
develop some type of scale that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

385
00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:00,709
grade against right now I hesitate to

386
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,200
say audit it's kind of an audit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

387
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,750
a really really detailed on it right

388
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,179
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not do you vote scan for</font>

389
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,789
vulnerabilities this is how mature is

390
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:12,200
your vulnerability management process

391
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:15,429
and we're going to be grading against

392
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,919
this at this level 1 level 2 and level 3

393
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:21,740
for your threat management programs

394
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,660
level 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application</font>

395
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so against all advanced application</font>

396
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,800
security and again adequately defend

397
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,350
itself this isn't like it's perfect

398
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,850
right but can adequately defend itself

399
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,199
against all<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced application</font>

400
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,840
security vulnerabilities and shows

401
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,790
principles of good security design<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

402
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:43,850
so now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a basic framework for</font>

403
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:46,010
this so we can improve this so we're

404
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to build it upon this framework</font>

405
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:53,200
this a SVS framework and improve this

406
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,200
when we talk about threat management

407
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not really going to</font>

408
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,190
concentrate on that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

409
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,650
organizations really probably aren't

410
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:06,559
doing anything about it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's get</font>

411
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:09,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the meat of what you know what we</font>

412
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,850
can now utilize because I assume

413
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,179
everybody here who's have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

414
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:16,040
conference probably isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

415
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:19,370
ignoring the security for your

416
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:22,850
organization right so level 1a SVS

417
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,709
opportunistic the organization can

418
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,540
adequately defend itself against

419
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,090
non-targeted threats that are easy to

420
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:33,110
discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what does that actually</font>

421
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:35,120
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is where this is where now</font>

422
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can begin to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together a framework</font>

423
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,809
of again tests that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to ask</font>

424
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:44,809
yourself and validate and verify that

425
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:48,410
would then put you into this level or

426
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:51,800
even furthering you know into level 2

427
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:56,570
and level 3 right so where I<font color="#CCCCCC"> came up</font>

428
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:59,149
with what I felt a good level one set of

429
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,760
tests for threat management would fall

430
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:06,200
looks like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no dedicated</font>

431
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,030
infra sec or risk group<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay just it</font>

432
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't you know that it's probably let's</font>

433
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:13,399
say a one-man shop right there's no

434
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,800
dedicated security individuals as

435
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,970
reliance on rudimentary alerts that are

436
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,790
coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your standard</font>

437
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,620
defense-in-depth controls there's

438
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:24,110
process in place for handling malware

439
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,850
infected systems okay typically that's

440
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,770
going to be probably looking like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

441
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:31,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">desk that's you know going to re-image</font>

442
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:32,658
reimage systems or whatever centralized

logging capabilities

444
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:37,399
no correlation so maybe some syslog you

445
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:38,539
know centralized syslog etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:49,209
threat intelligence right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sans words</font>

450
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:51,440
etc there may be an Associated

vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> met a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level one</font>

452

vulnerability management you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

453
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,440
that may have an open source or even a

454
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:01,999
commercial scanning tool but you know

455
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,889
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to what I said your your</font>

456
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:06,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">threat management and your vulnerability</font>

457
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:08,209
management processes need to grow with

458
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:11,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">each other and mature</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> collect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

459
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:14,809
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your organization is</font>

460
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:18,668
probably comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the mist / iso</font>

461
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:22,190
or whatever regulatory HIPAA PCI type

462
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:24,320
compliance if they feel that if they're

463
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,799
compliant<font color="#CCCCCC"> within those types of</font>

464
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:31,269
frameworks that were doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> our job</font>

465
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:34,220
that's what i would consider level<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

466
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:39,679
you know threat management applied to

467
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:42,619
the ASV s so let's talk about level<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

468
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,509
because in my opinion that's probably

469
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:49,149
not good enough for<font color="#CCCCCC"> most people in this</font>

470
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:52,099
you know in this room level two is

471
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:55,549
probably where most organizations who

472
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:58,279
aren't in let's say critical

473
00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:01,279
infrastructure or or responsible for

474
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:03,830
human lives being at stake level two is

475
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,739
probably where most organizations should

476
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:12,349
really kind of target for their threat

477
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:14,659
management process right so the over you

478
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:16,009
know the overarching kind of description

479
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:18,080
of level two applied the threat

480
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:19,429
management right the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization can</font>

481
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,799
adequately defend itself against

482
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:25,220
prevalent threats of moderate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to serious</font>

483
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:28,220
capability such threats could<font color="#E5E5E5"> include</font>

484
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,409
hacktivists and non-targeted targeting

485
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,090
organized crime actors the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

486
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:35,299
business organization so it should work

487
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:38,570
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this low towards this level right so</font>

488
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:43,300
all right that's neat what does it look

489
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:46,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">like and so here's where we start</font>

490
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,770
dedicated risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> in infosec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> groups right</font>

491
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:51,650
including a dedicated monitoring

492
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,889
resource now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> starting to get into</font>

493
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:56,540
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the you know we're delineating</font>

494
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,720
stuff down you know from threat

495
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:02,570
management into it's kind of like

496
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,280
associated areas of focus right so we're

497
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about monitoring at this point</font>

498
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,100
integration with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> existing level two</font>

499
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:12,200

threat actors using real-world tactics

504
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:28,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's also very important the</font>

505
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,990
infosec group itself may utilize an

506
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,389
enterprise ticketing system for

507
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,760
documenting tickets that tends<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

508
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,500
more critical for the vulnerability

509
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,330
management process than the threat

510
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:42,470
management process but it's still good

511
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:44,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">practice right and then the last one on</font>

512
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:47,390
this page is no some open source /

513
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:50,600
internal / commercial I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

514
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:55,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right let's sublevel of actual</font>

515
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:57,260
threat intelligence additionally we're

516
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,570
going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at a standard for</font>

517
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,870

logging and sim asset and data

521
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:14,679
classification you need to have asset

522
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:17,030
and data classification down to a tee

523
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,740
before you can even consider the next

524
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:22,000
one which is role based access control

525
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:25,580
standards based on said classifications

526
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,160
we need to define<font color="#E5E5E5"> the types of data in</font>

527
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:30,350
two types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of assets before we can then</font>

528
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,260
say you're not allowed to touch that

529
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:37,850
type of data because it's not within

530
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:39,830
your your need right a threat modeling a

Linux talk I'm sorry yeah five dot five

<font color="#CCCCCC">you okay yeah yeah I I'm and and yeah I</font>

542
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,090
totally agree with you guys in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back</font>

543
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,980
right but again in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world that</font>

544
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,689
would be just it's free and it's looking

545
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,450
at behavioral anomalies and it's like

546
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:44,180
the ha work with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own applications</font>

547
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:46,340
please<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so kind of</font>

548
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,350
following up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this right corporate</font>

549
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:51,110
cloud adoption standards you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

550
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:52,429
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is you know not what is allowed</font>

551
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,840
what's not allowed from a cloud

552
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:56,270
perspective we need to know this because

553
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,020
this all has to tie into you know the

554
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:01,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual threat management process itself</font>

555
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:05,560
third-party<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk assessments one final</font>

556
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that that one final thing is</font>

557
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:14,330
encrypt your right it still kind of

558
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,370
boggles my mind that organizations are

559
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,490
spending millions and millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

560
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:21,709
dollars on dlp and they're not

561
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:24,140
encrypting stuff I see this all the time

562
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:27,620
mm-hmm start with encryption puts you

563
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:30,020
know I get that sure we don't want to

564
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,939
let emails go out unencrypted that

565
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:36,440
contain<font color="#CCCCCC"> Social Security numbers but for</font>

566
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:38,600
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> pink raped please okay so that's</font>

567
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:43,360
that that's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like my feeling</font>

568
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,360
around what I'd level two yes sir

569
00:26:44,860 --> 00:27:00,520
so okay yeah so I don't have I don't

570
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:03,190
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> silver bullet there right you</font>

571
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,020
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think anybody does the this</font>

572
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,470
again I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I'm not I'm not really</font>

573
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:11,260
gonna try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to suggest the specifics yeah</font>

574
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,929
but but you know once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

575
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:15,580
framework in place you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

576
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:20,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">step is figuring out what's not going to</font>

577
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:23,980
break your so all right now let's

578
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:26,830
talk about level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 this indicates that</font>

579
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,840
your organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> can adequately defend</font>

580
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,928
itself against all advanced threats and

581
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,928
show principles of good security design

582
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:36,549
this is appropriate for critical that's

583
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:38,320
actually should know for organizations

584
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:44,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">that deal with critical infrastructure</font>

585
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:46,500
protect life etc techlife think of

586
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:50,260
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of replace ability right</font>

587
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:53,440
data replace ability I think I think

588
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,059
Josh Corman I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Corman was the first</font>

589
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,179
person I heard talk about in relation to

590
00:27:55,059 --> 00:28:03,280
this has anybody had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit card</font>

591
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:07,419
stolen what happened thank you it's

592
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,649
replaceable data got replaced right when

593
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:11,440
you start talking about intellectual

594
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:13,900
property you know the 11 herbs and

595
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,500
spices of Kentucky Fried Chicken if that

596
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:19,740
got stolen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now that represents you</font>

597
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">know competition potentially you know</font>

598
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,669
undercutting price there's stock

599
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,880
valuation that's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> associated</font>

600
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:31,480
well that that's a big impact to a

601
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:35,260
potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a potential big impact</font>

602
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,820
to a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> right electric cars right</font>

603
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,490
electric<font color="#E5E5E5"> cars are computers with wheels</font>

604
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:43,600
we have any red teamers in here all

605
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:46,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">right can you not wait till you get your</font>

606
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,678
Tesla so you can like just start

607
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:52,629
screwing with it right but what's the

608
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:53,260
what's the potential ramification there

609
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,320
right

610
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,820
human<font color="#CCCCCC"> life bluetooth paceman er yeah</font>

611
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,860
pacemakers with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth connections</font>

612
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:04,929
are you kidding me but you know

613
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:08,110
replaceable data irreplaceable<font color="#CCCCCC"> data and</font>

614
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:12,900
when we're dealing with organizations

615
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:16,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are really fundamentally you know</font>

616
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,340
protecting irreplaceable data now we're

617
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:22,540
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start thinking about this level</font>

618
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:25,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">three right so what does this</font>

619
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:27,430
potentially look like all right so we're

620
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna start with a threat prioritization</font>

621
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:33,970
standard right the way we've broken this

622
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:35,800
down is is in a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a</font>

623
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:38,320
three-phased approach right so there's a

624
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:41,710
triage which is mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpdesk type</font>

625
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,480
activities what we call suspect which is

626
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,880
then the security operation center

627
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,090
investigation phase you know that's been

628
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,070
escalated up and then now we've got

629
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,800
incident right the third one is full of

630
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,720
incident that incident then has to have

631
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,200
a mature framework which includes buying

632
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,700
participation from all business units

633
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,060
including and probably especially legal

634
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:08,380
in FX right because at an enterprise

635
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:11,950
level eat legal and ethics they need to

636
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,900
pretty much kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a degree QB how</font>

637
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:18,390
the organization is going to handle

638
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's say an insider threat right</font>

639
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,500
tabletop exercises<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right this is</font>

640
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,440
where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where them to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

641
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:29,500
the red / purple / whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

642
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,300
call it this is where what are

643
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,960
historically considered the attacking

644
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:37,750
teams this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really can begin</font>

645
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,770
contributing to the blue team defensive

646
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:43,230
kind of you know capabilities right so

647
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:46,960
stimulating domain breaches which means

648
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:49,510
in this exercise full-on<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of band</font>

649
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,700
communications all right so I know a lot

650
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">of organizations that when this lever is</font>

651
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:57,910
pulled and we realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

652
00:30:54,270 --> 00:31:00,460
serious incident all communications go

653
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:03,850
to like Google right because you can't

654
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,870
trust your own infrastructure fishing

655
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,100
high-value target

656
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,860
right so that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy that</font>

657
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:11,250
actually has access to the secret sauce

658
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:14,949
etc things things of that nature

659
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:17,740
simulated ransomware this is becoming a

660
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:20,950
big hot topic obviously as ransomware

661
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:23,770
matures and is is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

662
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:27,190
moving into the server space<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

663
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:33,490
the worm server space etc you know

664
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:35,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's according to meet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ya know I mean</font>

665
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't disagree it all yes it is there</font>

666
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,970
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's like now we're seeing</font>

667
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:44,460
just the beginning of that was it that's

668
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:47,050
a domino this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get really fun</font>

669
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,870
and then you know simulating that

670
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:52,510
malicious insider<font color="#CCCCCC"> all in all incident</font>

response contact management system where

673
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,330
all this stuff can be tracked we need to

674
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">know communications rhythm who needs to</font>

675
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,980
be contacted at what level of incident

676
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:05,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and how often those people need to</font>

677
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:08,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">be updated with you know the updates on</font>

anybody know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> mini cans is okay</font>

683
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:30,490
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cats the greatest red team</font>

684
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:32,260
tool ever right and go on to you know a

685
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,900
host and depending on the version of

686
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">windows can scrape clear text</font>

00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:41,080
credentials out of the else as process

688
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,490
and and and scrape the actual hashes the

689
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,699
password hashes from people who have

690
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:48,700
logged<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to these systems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's</font>

691
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:52,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much game over in most</font>

692
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:54,880
organizations you know that don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

693
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,620
have maybe let's say a level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

694
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident response you know it within</font>

695
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:01,750
their threat member so what deset is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

696
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,640
love this mmm the guys at Dell

697
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,040
SecureWorks they just released this like

698
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:12,159
a month and a half ago it's basically a

699
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:15,549
honey hash I saw your face

700
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:19,669
so it's a client-server architecture

701
00:33:15,549 --> 00:33:23,210
we're on a daily basis<font color="#CCCCCC"> every single host</font>

702
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:26,720
on your enterprise there's a little

703
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:31,279
agent right and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> day a random 30</font>

704
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:35,120
character password is injected<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

705
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:39,289
lsat process that random password hash

706
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:42,799
is associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that asset so now</font>

707
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:44,990
within your sin you're looking for them

708
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,539
as a separate sniffing process that has

709
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:50,919
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the same network or span port</font>

710
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:53,899
as as the actual domain controllers and

711
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:57,140
when that sniffing process sees somebody

712
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:59,799
trying to use what to them as an

713
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,840
attacker looks like a domain admin hash

714
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:06,080
that completely alerts you to exactly

715
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:12,848
what host that just came<font color="#E5E5E5"> from so now you</font>

716
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,848
can shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down it's really cool yes</font>

717
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:40,920
yeah that might be a deal-breaker so

718
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,659
this probably resonates to the guy in

719
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:47,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> background</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last year I said you</font>

720
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:50,629
should look into Emmett but yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

721
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:56,489
conceptually on paper it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

722
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:59,600
regular he<font color="#E5E5E5"> set the other two that I've</font>

723
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:01,830
listed here<font color="#CCCCCC"> kansa is a spectacular</font>

724
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:06,120
PowerShell based Incident Response

725
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:10,920
framework right it utilizes PowerShell

726
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:13,020
remoting so in the enterprise space you

727
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:15,150
know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably not the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

728
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,580
decision to just have power shell

729
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,050
remoting enabled on all of your you know

730
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,480
all of your systems without some type of

731
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:24,470
control so the way we've kind of

732
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,380
architected solutions around<font color="#CCCCCC"> kansa is</font>

733
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:30,629
you know essentially some type of proxy

734
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:35,190
you know that is IP limited or some type

735
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:38,130
of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know some limitation and to sorry</font>

736
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:41,640
and pushing out the actual controls to

737
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:46,700

741
00:35:58,009 --> 00:36:02,439
it's really really interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

742
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:06,410
moving on so process creation auditing

743
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:07,879
we had a really interesting we have a

744
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:11,328
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting blue team guy come in</font>

745
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:14,089
from fortune<font color="#E5E5E5"> for and he was talking</font>

746
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:16,579
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know here within the windows</font>

747
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:20,869
event logs are some specific things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

748
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:24,279
you should be monitoring for because and

749
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:28,489
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's kind of like a</font>

750
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:31,400
analyze your situation appropriately but

751
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:35,259
that guy turns out to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

752
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:37,369
indicator in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of environments of</font>

753
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:39,289
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably shouldn't be</font>

754
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:43,759
here spawning interesting and weird

00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:47,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff the opiate rights management I</font>

756
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:49,099
don't care it can be homegrown defined

757
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:51,469

enforceable identity access controls

759
00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:55,369
right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a big this is a big</font>

760
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:58,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of organizations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:36:55,369 --> 00:37:00,109
we run into you know and typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

762
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:01,939
see the pen tests come in plug something

00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:03,589
into the wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> and an open Ethernet port</font>

764
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:05,178
in some conference room and then within

765
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:07,369
eight hours that the main you know the

766
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:10,489
domain controllers are knocked over so

767
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:13,039
some type of you know system and again

768
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:14,719
yep we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to level three so the</font>

00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">majority of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff is not going to</font>

770
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:21,019
be cheap it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reality of it</font>

771
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:23,809
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and finally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for level 3</font>

772
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:25,428
identity access controls documented

773
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:26,689
threat multipliers you need a hat you

774
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:28,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what the threat</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a lie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now we are starting to get</font>

779
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,799
into the part<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the portion of</font>

780
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:45,169
threat management where we need to

781
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:48,140
understand who might be incentivized to

782
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:53,229
steal<font color="#CCCCCC"> our stuff and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are their</font>

783
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:56,420
capabilities right now like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

784
00:37:53,229 --> 00:38:00,330
qualitative risk assessment that can

785
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:02,850
tend to get voodoo ish right but it's

786
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:05,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good exercise to kind of go</font>

787
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,620
through and understand I think at the

788
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:10,380
end of the day the goal really<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to</font>

789
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:13,740
be you know having some semblance of an

790
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">understanding of who wants to see other</font>

791
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff and what their capabilities are</font>

792
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:19,680
because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that in our</font>

793
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:22,370
enterprise security architecture when

794
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:27,060
we're when we're designing and deploying

795
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:30,420
these types of controls over time their

796
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:33,810
intent really is to drive the adversary

797
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:53,070
return on investment 20 make them spend

798
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:55,230
too much time and too much money that's

799
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:56,790
third party as far as I'm concerned you

800
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:59,700
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> third party risk management a lot</font>

801
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:01,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">but when we get into let's say here's an</font>

802
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:08,970
acquisition it's not part of the

803
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:10,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization oh that's that absolutely</font>

804
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:14,700
part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third party risk management</font>

805
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,350
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that that and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

806
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,660
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back in a slide deck but you</font>

807
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:20,220
know I think the three pillars of the

808
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,170
enterprise security architecture is risk

809
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,509
management policy standards and then

810
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:26,520
design architecture right that falls on

811
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:29,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">a risk management straight and</font>

812
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,370
straightforward right it's so there's an

813
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,630
association to threat management even

814
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,069
the vulnerability management right

815
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,990
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to have an</font>

816
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:40,920
understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where that organization</font>

817
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:43,169
sits and are they are they sitting in a

818
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,480
manner that is acceptable for your

819
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:47,670
business but it's all you know

820
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,930
realistically that's all third part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

821
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:54,620
risk management absolutely periodic

822
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:56,210
threat matrix exercises etc and then

823
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,319
stakeholders

824
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:01,730
again going back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole metrics</font>

825
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:06,150
right but now now we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

826
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:09,230
metrics<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's talk about metrics</font>

827
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:12,600
in relation to threat management itself

828
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:15,510
we want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about incident metrics</font>

829
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:18,750
that can include the characteristics of

830
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:20,460
that type of incident target system

831
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,280
characteristics the timeline of an

832
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:25,290
incident number of systems targeted

833
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,450
attack metrics what's the vector right

834
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:30,560
what's the sophistication was this just

835
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:33,200
a ransomware was this some some Eau de

836
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,210
attack profile characteristics

837
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:39,020
obfuscation techniques right were they

838
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:41,730
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really hide their tracks etc</font>

839
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,800
data metrics what was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data targeting</font>

840
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:47,220
what was the data compromised was any

841
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,020
data X chill traded right you start

842
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:51,120
begin building these metrics around

843
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:55,190
threat management and now we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

844
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:58,920
I think to fold and we really begin to

845
00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:01,410
have a model where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can begin gauging</font>

846
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,170
our own improvement over time does a lot

847
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:08,520
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff can be simulated by red</font>

848
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:10,530
and purple teams right but then we also

849
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,540
now have the ability to like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

850
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:14,070
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> the importance of through</font>

851
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,080
metrics being able to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

852
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:18,780
up into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business right they don't</font>

853
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily need to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that whatever</font>

854
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know polymorphic encryption was used</font>

855
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,380
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular attack but we need to</font>

856
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:27,900
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least have some type of metric around</font>

857
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,730
those types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks and what they</font>

858
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,570
were targeting and how they you know

859
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:34,740
we're able to succeed etcetera mm-hmm

860
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:37,710
the practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> by status really kind of</font>

861
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,689
ties into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your enterprise ticketing</font>

862
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:43,020
system right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the stats around</font>

863
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:44,610
open and active etc you know tickets

864
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,340
around threat management typically

865
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:50,180
incidents and then a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

866
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:55,020
favorites being time to compromise and

867
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:56,759
cost to disrupt these are really really

868
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,090
fun metrics if you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the point</font>

869
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,920
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program within your maturity</font>

870
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:03,790
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the threat management program to</font>

871
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,240
begin deriving these

872
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:08,860
right so mean time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to compromise again</font>

873
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,310
you can simulate a lot of that stuff

874
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,810
through red and purple team testing you

875
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:17,560
know working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an organization that</font>

876
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:19,570
look you know we know that crown jewels

877
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,660
may exist on these types of systems or

878
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:25,450
domain controllers or what have you so

879
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,460
based on the existing controls the

880
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:30,399
existing you know detection and response

881
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:33,070
capabilities what is the mean time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

882
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,620
compromise these types of systems right

883
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:38,830
and now can we begin showing improvement

884
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:41,339
over time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then cost to disrupt right</font>

885
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:44,590
this and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is directly in relation to</font>

886
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:47,590
you know that adversary our ally now how

887
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:51,100
much is it going to cost the the

888
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:53,710
adversary to you know to get to the

889
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:58,240
point where that compromise succeeds

890
00:42:53,710 --> 00:43:00,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">right the cost to disrupt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's</font>

891
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,689
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font>

892
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:07,750
application of threat management within

893
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:10,180
the ASV s framework that that I kind of

894
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:13,360
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with right what I'm going to do</font>

895
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:15,490
is make this all up on github and make

896
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:19,210
it all<font color="#CCCCCC"> community based and all that</font>

897
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:21,520
stuff contribute whatever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

898
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to a couple slides here I want to</font>

899
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk briefly about threat modeling</font>

900
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,529
there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different ways again</font>

901
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,820
like I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to sit here and say</font>

902
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,500
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

903
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,110
couple of ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've seen work very</font>

904
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:37,570
well this is the three tenants threat

905
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:38,830
model the paper here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll make all</font>

906
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:40,420
this available<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the paper here</font>

907
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:42,850
quantitative metrics in hand risk

908
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:45,820
assessment the three tenant model of

909
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:48,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity it's an excellent</font>

910
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:51,700
excellent paper right so take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

911
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:53,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they really kind of go into they're</font>

912
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,720
not they're not just kind of

913
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:57,270
you know being a talking head like me

914
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,580
they're going into some really looking

915
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:05,340
gnarly risk math and calculations but

916
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:05,340
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and this came from that</font>

917
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,730
application of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> free tenants model</font>

918
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,460
I've seen work very well from a threat

919
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:15,760
modeling perspective but my personal

920
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:18,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">favorite is this from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bruges Potter is</font>

921
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,420
dirty<font color="#CCCCCC"> count for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top threat model for</font>

922
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:25,450
reals you can't get more straightforward

923
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:27,700
than this right so here's the threat

924
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:31,450
model that you need to understand the

925
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:34,000
variables right<font color="#CCCCCC"> actor does action to</font>

926
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:41,350
asset resulting in outcome because of

927
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:45,550
motivation it's beautiful what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

928
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:47,740
to do now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's not really a demo the</font>

929
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:51,880
way like you know i'm not writing code

930
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:53,169
and and I'm worried that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font>

931
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fail the only way that this is going</font>

932
00:44:53,170 --> 00:45:00,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fail as if is if and it up</font>

933
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:02,020
Excel but uh I'm going to give you a

934
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:08,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">little taste of some of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

935
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:13,600
we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font>

936
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:19,120
our threat prioritization matrix so

937
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:20,680
we're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this is our defense</font>

938
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:24,400
in fact a lot of our defensive depth

939
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:26,379
portion of our anniversary<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're working</font>

940
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">with our sin here's our ears are gay and</font>

941
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:32,320
he puts visual room<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

942
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,030
unfortunately named names here not

00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:38,230
promoting any book this just happens to

944
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:42,580
be one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones this first guy here</font>

is removable access controls cognitive

946
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:48,730
threat analytics is actually a weird

947
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:50,710
kind of byproduct of a cisco acquisition

948
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,300
it's you would actually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to search</font>

949
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:54,580
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in order the work if you don't</font>

950
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,970
know what it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's not something</font>

951
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they</font>

952
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:57,819
actually kind of cell but it's really

953
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:01,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">really interesting in terms of threat</font>

954
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:03,700
analytics cisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will say is the one</font>

955
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,970
organization that with the Talos a

956
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">manilla Talos is all right Talos is</font>

957
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,140
really interesting because that is

958
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:13,570
basically tying every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco of</font>

959
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:17,020
security device to a degree in to a

960
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:20,230
centralized global threat database right

961
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:22,720
they have analysts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are something</font>

962
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:24,730
gets found that may represent a threat

963
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,259
to an organization and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

964
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:29,470
ability for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

965
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:31,330
get redistributed out to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco</font>

966
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:35,500
devices and there's a lot of those out

967
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:40,569
there it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting so I</font>

968
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:44,350
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> game may be sky-high is a cloud</font>

969
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:47,620
thing CWS<font color="#E5E5E5"> acceptor the point here is</font>

970
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:50,410
that once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have on an understanding of</font>

971
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:53,080
once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good set of inputs we can</font>

972
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:55,870
begin looking at things like okay what

973
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:58,950
type of malware are we are we dealing

974
00:46:55,870 --> 00:47:01,930
with is it a backdoor right and so our

975
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:05,319
threshold for these first right so now

976
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:07,930
retired<font color="#E5E5E5"> volume court</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IED</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this core body</font>

977
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,010
is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of getting to how</font>

978
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:11,830
important are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> within the</font>

979
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:13,390
organization right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can call this</font>

980
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:16,930
power second you know call a few

981
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:19,450
PowerShell commands and get an idea of

982
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:23,080
what groups you are you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font>

983
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:25,089
active directory and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can associate</font>

984
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,420
those groups with what should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an</font>

985
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:30,280
existing critical asset or critical

986
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:33,460
function services and functions within

987
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:36,340
the organization if your groups that you

988
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,560
are a member<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tie into let's say the</font>

989
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:41,050
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten critical services within the</font>

990
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:47,770
business that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a threat</font>

991
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:49,450
multiplier right service level etc so

992
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:51,040
what we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> here are thresholds and</font>

993
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,910
I'll kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bump this up here I'll make</font>

994
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big boy</font>

995
00:47:54,090 --> 00:48:02,460
this guy right so our threshold in this

996
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:05,310
particular little spreadsheet was 13 and

997
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:07,500
anything about 13 miles place now that

998
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:11,100
particular thing gets escalated to the

999
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:13,770
sock team sock team is now taking a look

1000
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:16,680
at things that may or may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have</font>

1001
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:20,670
actual access to you may not understand

1002
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:23,399
like who you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the origin what</font>

1003
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,500
is the intent of this potential threat

1004
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,000
right so those then we consider threat

1005
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,520
multipliers if you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1006
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,850
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to affect the overarching threat</font>

1007
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:36,170
result the scoring here so to speak but

1008
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the end of the day and I'll kind of</font>

1009
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:41,880
muck with this a little bit here you can

1010
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,380
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that here okay we've got our rating</font>

1011
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,700
we've got our description response

1012
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:48,960
accountability who to notify

1013
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:51,330
communications rhythm and post report if

1014
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">I drop this down to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1015
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,750
as serious all that stuff's going to

1016
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:58,770
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now we kind of have a rough</font>

1017
00:48:54,750 --> 00:49:01,650
idea of what our threat reaction or the

1018
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:03,240
reaction should be in relation to some

1019
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:05,190
type of threat within the organization

1020
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,819
now again that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we just</font>

1021
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:11,130
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a specific organ a</font>

1022
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:13,740
specific client of ours and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works for</font>

1023
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:17,970
them all of this can be completely you

1024
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:19,319
know modulated modified etc to fit your

1025
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:21,029
needs the other one that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

1026
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:25,170
a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is really where I</font>

1027
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:27,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">think some of the value of applying this</font>

1028
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:30,330
to the ASDs is going to come through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1029
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:33,180
ASDs actually provides you can just

1030
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:36,830
download this actual spreadsheet alright

1031
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:41,009
so this spreadsheet then you can see

1032
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:42,509
does this first thing which is verify

1033
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:44,430
all pages and resource require

1034
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:47,340
authentication except those specifically

1035
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:49,450
identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether all right it shows you</font>

1036
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:55,150
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a requirement for level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1037
00:49:49,450 --> 00:50:00,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">tues that requirement for 13 the entire</font>

1038
00:49:55,150 --> 00:50:01,480
SVS set of requirements and begin and

1039
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:03,810
again this is where this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the</font>

1040
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,890
grade line between an audit and

1041
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:09,040
something more you know sophisticated

1042
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:11,379
that has more teeth this has teeth<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1043
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,140
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we can really begin saying</font>

1044
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:16,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's not about necessarily are you</font>

1045
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,250
scanning other the example is are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1046
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:20,290
scanning for vulnerabilities it's how

1047
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:24,730
mature your vulnerability management

1048
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:28,390
program is right and so what I begun to

1049
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:32,740
do is apply this over to threat

1050
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:36,400
management so kind of come over here a

1051
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:38,500
little bit right so a lot of the stuff

1052
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,540
that I've talked about now I'm going to

1053
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,920
I'm going to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing I'm going</font>

1054
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,750
to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing from vulnerability</font>

1055
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,510
management and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1056
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,950
this you know I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make all this</font>

1057
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:50,380
public open source and you can

1058
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:53,470
contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> in github and all that but I</font>

1059
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:55,329
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this point now we have a much</font>

1060
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:59,140
more manageable framework that does have

1061
00:50:55,329 --> 00:51:02,230
teeth that you can kind of say okay my

1062
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:04,589
goal is to at least get to level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 from</font>

1063
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:07,599
a threat management perspective and

1064
00:51:04,589 --> 00:51:12,160
where do I lack what do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus</font>

1065
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:18,780
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right does that make sense all</font>

1066
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:18,779
right back to this of course

1067
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:39,279
good so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> next I think in relation</font>

1068
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:42,820
to the relation to the actual the ASDs

1069
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:46,300
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdlc process that's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

1070
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:48,720
originally intended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I did that</font>

1071
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:54,280
last year applied this to vulnerability

1072
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:55,419
and now this is all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1073
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,010
open source but I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next step</font>

1074
00:51:55,420 --> 00:52:01,770
logically is identity management and so

1075
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:06,790
with all that kind of setup you know

1076
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:10,720
public<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that I I mean I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

1077
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:12,700
and I really kind of hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this kind</font>

1078
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,859
of this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of testing with these types</font>

1079
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:18,330
of frameworks to understand the maturity

1080
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:21,310
of these processes<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a much more</font>

1081
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:24,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">important and much more successful way</font>

1082
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:28,240
to really kind of begin measuring more

1083
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:30,490
of the objective security in a way that

1084
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,649
isn't you know that you know you're not

1085
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:34,750
actually getting like super super you

1086
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:37,000
know knee-deep into into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeds but</font>

1087
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:41,290
also you know it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a compliance on</font>

1088
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:44,620
it right so that's pretty much that's

1089
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:47,490
what I got guys so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got a few</font>

1090
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,490
minutes are there any questions

1091
00:52:50,979 --> 00:52:58,848
I'm sorry I'll put them<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on SlideShare</font>

1092
00:52:55,519 --> 00:53:13,549
yeah I'll let her let the Rochester

1093
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:15,619
organizers know yes sir assets yeah yeah

1094
00:53:13,549 --> 00:53:17,599
absolutely yeah you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1095
00:53:15,619 --> 00:53:20,779
lexicon was probably very information

1096
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:23,390
specific but at the end of the day right

1097
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:25,579
the critical one of the most critical

1098
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:29,569
components here is understanding what

1099
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:32,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the critical assets that support</font>

1100
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:34,130
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business critical data right and</font>

1101
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:35,900
then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then who has access to that and</font>

1102
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:44,869
all that one yeah but absolutely yes

1103
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:51,559
yeah yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep questions comments am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1104
00:53:44,869 --> 00:53:55,789
completely off my rocker not yet I'm

1105
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:57,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking forward to it all right there's</font>

1106
00:53:55,789 --> 00:53:59,859
no no questions then thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1107
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,859
appreciate it
