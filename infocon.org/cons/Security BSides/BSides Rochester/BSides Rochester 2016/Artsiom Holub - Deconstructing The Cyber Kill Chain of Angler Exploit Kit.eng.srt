25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,280
when you think about five better flops

how it looked when it just started why

30
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:47,399
do I draw the parallels and call it a

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,890
peachy in bigger scale usually you are

32

here apt only about small networks

last couple years<font color="#E5E5E5"> angler was privately</font>

distributing ransomware which is a huge

41
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:19,070

doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> opendns to our detect and prevent</font>

43
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:29,250
this stuff so an exploit kit is a set of

44
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,769
payloads or exploits building our one

45
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,340
solution that's why it's all powerful so

46
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,900
you can be a management console you have

47
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:42,150
some kind of imported data for the stuff

48
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,800
that you will exploit in this case

49
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:50,550
usually those domains or just the web

50
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:54,420

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazing job analyzing payloads and</font>

exploit kids in particular

69
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:59,500
so he saw some of these payloads using

70
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,530
those files capabilities as early as

71
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,769
follows 2013 but he didn't pay too much

72
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,439
attention at on it until the black hole

73
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:13,989
take down after the black hole was taken

74
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:16,329
down in October 2013 a lot of malware

75
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:19,000
authors move to be looking for like

76
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:22,509
another exploit that's where the angler

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,300
came in play and after analyzing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

78
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:29,280
and analyzing the way angler works we

79
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:32,320
can see that it started all the way in

80
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,559
2010 and it's called xxx on the

81

little<font color="#E5E5E5"> chain and deconstructed because</font>

85
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:56,530
usually if like before we used to tell

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> apt only when you target something</font>

network of company network or something

89
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:09,039
else however if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the internet</font>

90
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:13,150
at the same network just huge scale so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

91
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:16,449
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> angler authors and the people</font>

92
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:19,198
behind it did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great job they super</font>

93
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:21,580
persistent there were enormous amount of

94
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,190
researchers spending a huge amount of

95
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:27,210
time finding their see two servers

96
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:31,780
blocking them taking them down however

97
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:34,630
it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> there it's very advanced it</font>

98
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,000
uses advanced techniques on all stages

99
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:40,719
of camping if you tell if you talk about

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,220
payloads the most used<font color="#CCCCCC"> SI VES are</font>

101
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,060
implemented we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Java</font>

102
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,400
vulnerability would be disclosed

103
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,759
publicly three days later<font color="#CCCCCC"> they would</font>

104
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:56,289
have exploited for it implementing honey

105
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,139
pot and antivirus avoidance I'll we've

106
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,419
been

107
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:02,520
doing a lot of honey pot projects to try

108
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:06,510
to catch all that stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't</font>

109
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,919
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> any of angular why because they were</font>

110
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,500
pretty sophisticated they would

111
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,870
penetrate your network see that oh it's

112
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably not a real you see there is no</font>

113
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:21,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason to infect it so they just don't</font>

114
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:23,639
drop the final payload they after we

115
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,430
figure out the schema that they used to

116
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs and we can real there a</font>

117
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,970
pattern for it and block it as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

118
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">we see something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks like the</font>

119
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,910
pattern they change it they switch to

120
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,790
the main shadowing which is a lot more

121
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:42,360
advanced technique but it requires

122
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:47,310
additional steps for the malware people

123
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:49,560
to get you the domain accounts all the

124
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,470
payloads that delivered by angular are

125
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,910
either highly obfuscating or encrypted

126
00:06:52,470 --> 00:07:01,350
and this way for antivirus is super hard

127
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:03,990
to you know decrypt every single package

128
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,750
or every single stuff that they cut they

129
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:10,560
are for skated and they plow becoming

130
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:16,979
pretty much useless persistent as i

131
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:19,530
already told in october 2015 Talos tube

percent of its traffic but four months

135
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:36,780

00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:39,810
same if even not bigger traffic and it's

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,549
everybody knows what is it where it's

140
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:52,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">kinda strong but nobody know how to</font>

about much about my backups when I seen

I just been up all night sensitive data

every week however besides ransomware

want make an extra buck you just rent

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:33,510
out your infrastructure to other malware

152
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:37,750
guys right so Carlos using opendns data

153
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:39,659
find out at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> three emails that were</font>

associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with different actors</font>

00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:49,300
delivering video hosting angular hosting

156
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:55,630
Lord and delivering different payloads

157
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:59,319
like timba and necro<font color="#E5E5E5"> stratagem so with</font>

158
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,920
that I would like to break down their

159
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:06,190
cyber kill chain of it if you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

160
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">apt it's a lot bigger I'll and you can</font>

161
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:11,890
break it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to you in smaller parts</font>

162
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,130
here I would I combine some steps

163
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:17,920
together just because they happen either

164
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:21,930
like simultaneously or one right after

165
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,849
another so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I came to the reconnaissance</font>

166
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,219
exploitation and because anization

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:34,029
delivery installation common control and

168
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:36,220
actions so reconnaissance for any apt or

169
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:38,500
any malware campaign<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

170
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,230
important because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

171
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,510
waste infrastructure that's protected

172
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,700
from everybody else because if you lost

173
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,290
that basic infrastructure you're pretty

174
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">much toast like all your business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

175
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:54,520
broken and with angular we'd see that

176
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,430
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't really afraid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose</font>

177
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:00,130
it sometimes they expose it but the

178
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,670
reason is pretty simple because they

179
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:07,660
like they are unreachable most of the

180
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:10,099
basic infrastructure located in Eastern

181
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:16,279
Europe countries like Russia<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kazakhs</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Ukraine so even if FBI can go and ask</font>

most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in these countries</font>

185
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:26,269
wouldn't care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that much yet one</font>

186
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:30,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the reasons that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let read some words</font>

187
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:32,720
like grow and spread for the main

188
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:36,349
registers for the main shadowing they

189
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,720
have to have domain registrant accounts

190
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,389
of course you can put out a bunch of

191
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,810
freedom<font color="#CCCCCC"> by fake accounts for yourself</font>

192
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:48,380
and use them just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one time but with the</font>

193
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:53,089
main shadowing you defeat something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

194
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:56,630
popularity check and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you register</font>

195
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:58,279
your domain couple days ago and you want

196
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,100
to route the huge amount of traffic to

197
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,259
it it would flag immediately in many

198
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:07,339
security appliances and you wouldn't

199
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:11,209
deliver anything they also used a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

bulletproof hosting which are pretty

201
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:15,439
common they're not that huge amount of

202
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,660
them but as they still exist those are

203
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:21,769
just companies who can cost anything and

204
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,079
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you do with</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as long as you pay the money I've</font>

206
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">used large providers we've seen a lot of</font>

other big providers but that doesn't

00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:35,449
mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're bare they just it's</font>

210
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,420
hard for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to handle all that</font>

211
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:43,880
enormous amount of domains they offering

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:47,019
to people also at the primal way their

213
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,370
angular delivered their initial payload

214
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:52,189
advertising companies it becomes

215
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:56,060
possible because<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies want</font>

216
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:57,889
to maximize their income so they are

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,489
participating something that they called

218
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:04,100
ad hopping or an exchange so if you have

any payloads yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gathering the</font>

00:12:52,040 --> 00:13:01,969
information so dedicated infrastructure

used to get those domain registrant

239
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:07,970
emails how it was done was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:12,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">all unsophisticated technique fishing</font>

241
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:16,239
they gathered a bunch of the domain

00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:19,549
registry emails temptem phishing emails

243
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:21,739
most of them would answer because most

244
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:24,799
of the companies don't really think that

245
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:26,540
DNS registrant email is something

246
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:29,029
important is something that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used</font>

247
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">against them and ambler people change</font>

248
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:33,919
that a lot now everybody have to

249
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,929
implement any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> control for their</font>

250
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:39,529
dns records they are becoming really

251
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:43,549
really pleasurable so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the fishing</font>

252
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:46,519
campaign finished they got some command

of the accounts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> let them build</font>

their initial infrastructure to actually

deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> rent somewhere so for their</font>

exploitation those are the websites that

258
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:06,499
would deliver the initial payload the

259
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:09,769
what we've seen breaking down to the

260
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:13,160
parts and we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that most of them</font>

are coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the WordPress and domain</font>

if you have a domain that using

wordpress how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often do you go three logs</font>

not a dolphin but we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing</font>

269
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:38,230
analysis on that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress sites got</font>

270
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:41,740
his every day sometimes from multiple

271
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,650
resources it's those are scanners at big

272
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:50,290
scales that run every day was from good

273
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:52,270
guys and bad guys as well so with the

274
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,420
very beginning of the campaign the

275
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:57,670
amount of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> abused or compromised</font>

276
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,290
websites is pretty low most of them

277
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:02,469
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be delivered using the main</font>

278
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:04,660
shadowing and dedicated servers but at

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point where we analyzing them right</font>

280
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:13,209
now most of the shifting to their

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:16,660
compromised domains those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVTs that</font>

282
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:22,720
we've seen been used for the past 90

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:25,150
days the smallest one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the very</font>

bottom it's a silverlight<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploit it</font>

286
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,959
think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see the growing of it more</font>

287
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more just because people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get used</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java get exploited a lot people get</font>

289
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:42,400
used at some other technologies getting

290
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:46,630
exploited a lot and it's not because

291
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,520
those technologies are we of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad now</font>

292
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,400
it's because they implemented everywhere

293
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,260
so that's what you target you know that

294

all this crappy stuff on your PC's when

298
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,810
you don't even know what's going on on

that's becoming bigger and bigger

301
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,750
problem and not all the people know that

302

work guys pretty clear they noted and

they use

306
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:31,260
so initial exploitation take place where

307
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:33,690
you want to defeat and build your

308
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:38,100

331
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:54,840
like they go for this kind of stuff

332
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:59,240
anymore so delivery schema delivery

333

334
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:07,590
security appliances so a lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:09,979
getting like imported at least from open

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:13,320
sources or some other companies that

337
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:16,620
building those lists up they also know

338
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,409
how firewalls work they also know how

339
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:23,360
any other security appliance work cell

340
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:26,760

343
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,480
darkly that's

we called it which is a not a server

345
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,600

<font color="#E5E5E5">a server that your payload calls in life</font>

349
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:58,320
resides on as a PHP code on the on the

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:09,879
and that's where all these ed companies

354
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:13,929
plane for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad guys because most of</font>

355
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:20,100
the ads are in the eye frames are they

356
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:22,810
up banners second is the redirect to

357
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,610
before like it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said like if they</font>

358
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:27,190
would just register a bunch of domains

359
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the popularity check can see that</font>

360
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,090
oh it's unknown domain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly is</font>

361
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:34,090
getting like 10,000 queries an hour oh

362
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:37,419
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad so they implement</font>

363
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:42,070
that was used with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> articles the DNS</font>

364
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:45,040
shadowing is different if Deena's

365
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:48,639
shadowing looks like you have the

366
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:51,510
initial domain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> habits a history it</font>

367
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,550
have its popularity but it has a

368
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:57,340
compromise dns record of the bad guy

369
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:00,100
going to the dns settings add another

370
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:03,429
sub domain they would reside on totally

371
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:06,459
different IP but for the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> plans</font>

372
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:09,220
it still looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the just a subdomain</font>

373
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:12,210
of the well-known<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain so it's proudly</font>

374
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,460
legit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> why not let the user go there</font>

375
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:20,670
so and you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the screen so</font>

376
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:24,700
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is probably some kind of</font>

377
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:26,980
generating algorithm the second part is

378
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:32,920
the actual domain that got compromised

379
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:34,620
and recently we've seen that this scheme

380
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,059
are changing again

381
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,889
because we already find out what the

382
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:41,070
main shadowing is and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

383
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:44,709
start care about their dns records and

384
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:47,230
they start building in there I frames

385
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,870
that during the rhetoric just looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

386
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:55,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the form of those sides again for most</font>

387
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:58,629
of security appliances sorry it looks

00:20:55,269 --> 00:21:01,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">like you are not living the same domain</font>

that so that just more in details how

392
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:15,700
the delivery and exploitation so first

393
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:20,080
you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your well-known site let's say</font>

pledged everything is<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine you are not</font>

440
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,750
getting the next step in the

441
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:05,410
exploitation change you say this is good

442
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:07,450
and we're good which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like if you are</font>

443
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:11,590
not vulnerable you don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you be in attack if you wonderful you're</font>

445
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:17,949
done so then you hit the lender page

00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:20,889
again web filter failed web address<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

not blog at payload delivered which is

00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:26,650
usually rent somewhere either encrypted

449
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,650
or highly appreciated antivirus is

450
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:32,710
failing here negotiation is going on

451
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:34,750
your pc<font color="#E5E5E5"> again for the antivirus the</font>

452
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:38,500
encryption by itself doesn't look

453
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:42,090
malicious tons of regular software on

454
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:45,460
your pc uses encryptions all the time so

455
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:47,639
how antivirus would know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font>

456
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,269
encryption that you don't have control

457
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:55,129
there is no way especially

458
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:59,029
with their finest malware I will break

459
00:24:55,129 --> 00:25:01,699
it down in details little further there

460
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:04,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">is like no evidence left even if you</font>

461
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,499
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can target it and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

462
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:08,389
that you've been exploited for forensic

463
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:10,249
guy who would come he would check the

464
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:13,939
entire system you say hey you don't have

465
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:16,549
anything right that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear on</font>

466
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,459
their side that they implemented so when

467
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:21,649
the data encrypted malware will usually

468
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:23,299
check for any local backups so it will

469
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:25,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">be easy for you to just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> restore your</font>

470
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,049
data if it would find them it would

471
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,419
delete it and then just<font color="#E5E5E5"> play the rents</font>

on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> house so at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point for user</font>

oh don't pay ransom values again up to

479
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:53,690
you some people would let it<font color="#E5E5E5"> go but most</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care about all their stuff</font>

that they have on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their pcs pictures</font>

482
00:25:55,489 --> 00:26:07,190
text some job files maybe so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

483
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">files ransomware works when the payload</font>

484
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:13,940
located exploitable process that already

00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:18,379
reside in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the memory it will inject the</font>

486
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:21,589
first payload in it that process have to

487
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:28,070
call load library when the load library

488
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:31,158
called it forces<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the dll to load in</font>

489
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:34,339
the context of the process so no matter

490
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:37,579
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be it would have at least</font>

491
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:42,079
user privileges and user privileges is

492
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:45,889
enough to increase staff so when the

493
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:48,320
deal is injected it loads remote dll<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zen</font>

494
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:50,629
deal never is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PC it's at</font>

499
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:04,809
be in your system all the time and

500
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:06,369
that's why you can find it however in

for Samuel Dale stop that infection at

00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:54,460
some point of the chain right but as the

average the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money they made a</font>

00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:01,899
year was about 35 million dollars that's

516
00:27:57,129 --> 00:28:08,738
huge amount of money if you look at it

517
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:12,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">as just the cash usually it breaks down</font>

include the process of legalizing those

00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:21,820
bitcoins main ways are carding shopping

underground exchange and money mules

522
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:29,739
with the underground exchange one of the

523
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:33,279
actors behind angler used to have the

buy bitcoins who<font color="#E5E5E5"> affected with rent</font>

527
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:42,580
somewhere which looked like an ideal

528
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:45,009
schema right you delivered<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ransom</font>

529
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,019
the people have to buy bitcoins they go

530
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:48,580
to server they give you cash you give

531
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:51,249
them the bitcoins that goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight</font>

532
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:54,689
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you however he took it down</font>

533
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:58,920
almost immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the black</font>

534
00:28:54,690 --> 00:29:02,570
take down so who knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> why but now they</font>

535
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:05,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to use all in our older techniques</font>

536
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:09,060
they also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money on the</font>

537
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:12,240
infrastructure there are losses of money

538
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:15,780
on any step either it would be carving

539
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,740
shopping or underground exchange the

540
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:21,120
exchange rates are pretty wild for the

541
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:24,290
paypal account with five thousand

542
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:28,260
dollars you have to pay about 17

543
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:30,480
bitcoins which is icing one bitcoins

544
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,879
like five hundred dollars so that's you

545
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,040
losing a lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd like for the</font>

546
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,130
people behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there is no sense to do</font>

547
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:41,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all the time however the end lost</font>

548
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:44,030
is about fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's why</font>

549
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:48,180
they will keep doing what they're doing

550
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:51,120
fifty percent is roughly 17 million

551
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:54,840
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thwart is roughly they might</font>

552
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,870
make more or less but they wouldn't go

553
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,389
away that's just ideal business for

554
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:05,959
people who live somewhere wherever I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

555
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:11,250
get them so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing opendns to</font>

556
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:12,930
stop that first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all most of</font>

557
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:17,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ransomware have been delivered</font>

558
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:20,460
through the domains or at least we've

559
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:23,790
seen very very rare you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the payload</font>

560
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,310
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would have a hard coded IP and we</font>

561
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:28,830
deal with DNS data as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I told</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like we</font>

562
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:34,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">deal about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred million requests a</font>

563
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:40,580
day so we can analyze big data looking

564
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:44,220
for patterns and to see how compromised

565
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:47,149
dedicated and like domain shadowing

566
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:50,640
infrastructure different traffic flow

567
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:53,580
between them we use something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

568
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,710
pure n which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you look at DNS</font>

569
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,620
queries will look at them at the sound

570
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,549
wave so you have the low part and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

571
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,668
suddenly

572
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:05,639
traffic start coming so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a way</font>

573
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:09,690
that might be one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the indicator but</font>

574
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:12,330
it's not exactly clear because a lot of

575
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:16,649
domains getting those wave just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

576
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:18,720
they launching like ad campaign oh they

577
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:21,299
got like simple like super popular

578
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,480
articles got tagged like<font color="#E5E5E5"> some by some</font>

579
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:30,629
guy on the head Twitter so we have to

580
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:32,909
mix it with other techniques so we are

581
00:31:30,629 --> 00:31:35,070
used to do a lot of honey pots now we're

582
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:39,450
trying to one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our researchers is</font>

583
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:42,210
doing something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's it's not like</font>

584
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:44,399
passive<font color="#E5E5E5"> honeypot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's active honeypot so</font>

585
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:48,720
it wouldn't just sit in the network it

586
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:52,939
would also go for payloads by itself and

587
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,619
we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sometimes from the same</font>

588
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:59,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromised domain you got different</font>

589
00:31:55,619 --> 00:32:02,908
payloads they are slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> different but</font>

590
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:06,210
they always rent somewhere so<font color="#CCCCCC"> pirating</font>

591
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:08,609
around those domains I let us discovered

592
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:13,590
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the compromised registrant</font>

593
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:15,210
emails might be so we can block some of

594
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:18,629
that stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be compromised</font>

595
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:20,850
later ahead of the time it raises<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

596
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:24,449
issues with people not understanding how

597
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:26,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">that work and you know screaming and</font>

598
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:29,850
crying that they didn't do anything bad

599
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:32,820
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> was their domain registered email</font>

600
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:35,309
they don't think it's better so after

601
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,850
analyzing that we use I use investigate

602
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:41,840
they also we use a visual a graphical

603
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:46,109
analysis which I would show<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

604
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,988
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that how it looks in investigate so</font>

605
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:52,199
you have the domain that had no traffic

606
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:55,499
at all and suddenly it got like 400

607
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,970
queries an hour that raises<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flag and</font>

608
00:32:55,499 --> 00:33:01,650
then there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

609
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:04,049
analyze it so this particular domain is

610
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:09,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the initial infrastructure</font>

611
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:11,340
for the non native Russian speaker it

612
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:13,889
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sense but I speak</font>

613
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:17,480
Russian and I can see that this is the

614
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:20,610
name in Russian just transliterated in

615
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,340
English alphabet so if you translate it

616
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:28,649
there would be a head of the

617
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:31,709
hippopotamus that one of the way of one

618
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:33,360
of the reasons why malware people don't

619
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:36,419
want to use something like that because

620
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,939
as soon as they see the pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

621
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:42,030
build a red X I can look for anything

622
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:44,970
that much this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff and plot it</font>

623
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:53,210
ahead of the time or just flag it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

624
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:56,070
you sell breaking down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email that</font>

625
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:58,620
this domain was registered to you is

626
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:01,200
another dedicated email because it's not

627
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,530
stolen again have the same pattern it's

628
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,530
rational<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's Russian words</font>

629
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:10,290
transliterating in English alphabet if

630
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:12,330
we pie with down<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you see that it</font>

631
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:15,899
doesn't have just one have multiple

632
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:18,869
domains and this actually a live actor

633
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:21,330
it got new domains popping up<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

634
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:23,250
every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's getting to</font>

635
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:28,230
the block<font color="#E5E5E5"> list and he keeps doing more</font>

636
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:33,149
and more and more the top part right

637
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:35,969
here and those are there alternative

638
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers and they have mapped to the</font>

639
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:41,848
order box<font color="#CCCCCC"> gns calm which was highly</font>

640
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:45,750
amused by many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the malware people for</font>

641
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:48,300
a long time unfortunately the way they

642
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:51,690
provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service doesn't give them</font>

643
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:55,109
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to stop or to identify well more</font>

644
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:57,990
actors right away and right down there

645
00:34:55,109 --> 00:35:00,470
we see that they will a bigger network

646
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,790
based on those couple domains they ready

647
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,990
they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> letters</font>

648
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:10,099
again and that's it so if you if you

649
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:12,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ASM we see that currently</font>

650
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:16,099
we see just one malicious domain but all

651
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:18,379
the most of the domains that would be

652
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:23,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">registered on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PSN and would matching</font>

653
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:26,990
those few patterns so either registered

654
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:31,580
by one of the actors email another actor

655
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:35,149
is right right<font color="#CCCCCC"> down here oh so what if</font>

656
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:38,598
it registered by this guy or this guy

657
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:41,119
and it much is one of these patterns we

658
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,430
can block it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right away but those are</font>

659
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,280
dedicated and abuse service and those

660
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:52,009
are dedicated accounts that used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

661
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:58,060
multiple scams this guy de Valera which

662
00:35:52,010 --> 00:36:01,040
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> his name his couple advertising</font>

663
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:03,799
companies registered with the same email

664
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,430
so we can see it's not something

665
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:10,490
compromised he actually dip in them

666
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:13,848
second part is the one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got from</font>

667
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:17,270
our active panic hope so you can see

668
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:20,650
here that it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the main</font>

669
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:24,020
shadowing right away it has their first

670
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:31,000
word<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything then</font>

671
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:34,910
have a legit domain underneath and this

672
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:39,260
domain hosted on that IP but if we take

673
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:42,799
a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> on just the second-level domain</font>

674
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:46,280
it happen they're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different IP if</font>

675
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:50,530
we look who registered that we can see

676
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:53,690
that there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot other domains that</font>

677
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:55,940
use the same registrant<font color="#CCCCCC"> Demuro and this</font>

678
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:59,060
is a good indicator that those domains

679
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,070
can be compromised most of the time what

680
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:03,320
we've seen they<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable they</font>

681
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,670
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving their attacking</font>

682
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,710
infrastructure from domain to domain

683
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:14,630
it takes them about<font color="#E5E5E5"> five to three days</font>

684
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:16,890
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we block this ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the time</font>

685
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,990
even if they are not malicious right now

686
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:21,720
they might be malicious three or five

687
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:26,129
days later and down there is a valid

688
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:29,910
proof hosting Russian asn that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost a</font>

690
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:42,598
domains so using investigate and our

691
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,760
infrastructure we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the seat no</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">read malware virus total panic pod and</font>

694
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:52,890
we can pilot around that seed to find

695
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:59,309
out the bigger infrastructure and the

696
00:37:52,890 --> 00:38:04,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">big indicators of compromise so for the</font>

697
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:06,900
last 90 days those are the highly abused

698
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:09,839
and they have the biggest amount of

699
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:15,589
malicious domains the delivering angler

700
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:22,349
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this one you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see that</font>

701
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:25,109
it located in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ukraine and it have really</font>

702
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:28,230
weird name which looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the name of</font>

703
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:31,980
one of the guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> who actually probably</font>

704
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:35,520
pretty close to the actors or to their

705
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:38,119
authors of that exploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> kid and I want</font>

706
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,119
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just show</font>

707
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:47,550
dress let's investigate there would be

708
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:52,260
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see I already look it</font>

709
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:55,680
up then Ted this guy thank you Sam isn't

710
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:59,250
that be but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before he didn't have his</font>

711
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:06,060
name however he change it a little bit

712
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:09,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the amount of a bad websites like</font>

713
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:11,759
ninety-five percent so some of the

714
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,860
domains that are hosted<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are just</font>

715
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,460
not live I think if they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life</font>

716
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:20,970
the malicious domains on this particular

717
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:25,500
SN would be found hundred percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

718
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:32,279
so i would like to actually so one of

719
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:37,440
the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we use to analyze big</font>

720
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:40,530
data is open gravity you can access<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

721
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:47,300
at open<font color="#E5E5E5"> gravity calm and i would like to</font>

722
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:50,690
show you a demo how how do we use it so

723
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,690
let's start

724
00:39:55,089 --> 00:40:02,529
with open refugee you can analyze any

725
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:06,129
data set that comes in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON format for</font>

726
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:14,019
the domains that I analyzed for the IPS

727
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:16,329
I analyzed I tube the data from but I

728
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:21,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">build the data set and met all their ips</font>

729
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:24,509
to the ASM and let's see how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

730
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,509
we open it

731
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:43,950
so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all that I piece that are</font>

732
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:47,550
associated with anger you see there are

733
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:50,279
some nodes that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected and map to</font>

734
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:54,330
the air sense and some notes are not so

735
00:40:50,280 --> 00:41:00,150
to make it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> less or more distinct</font>

736
00:40:54,330 --> 00:41:06,020
like I to remove all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Roy</font>

737
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:06,020
nice picture of highly abused their sins

738
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:56,599
so all the isolated notes are gone and

739
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:06,619
we can see so just let's add some colors

740
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:26,700
oh yes open graffiti is an ongoing

741
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:30,320
project I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> fts idolized and this is the</font>

742
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:35,339
last presentation if you didnt broke

743
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:40,220
yeah sorry for that sometimes have

744
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:40,220
always liked demonstrations

745
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:50,269
so let's think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about prevention I keep</font>

746
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,970
the data that is available for you

747
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:54,379
backed up all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time please you don't</font>

748
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:58,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to pay five hundred dollars just</font>

749
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:01,549
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you're a decaf right for</font>

750
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:08,660
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies at this point you have to</font>

751
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:12,470
implement at least one dns controller

752
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:16,519
what it would be it's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you but with</font>

753
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:19,220
the ransomware most of it cap can be

754
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:21,740
stopped at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS level of course if</font>

755
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:26,269
you use layer security it's way better

756
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:28,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">just because the exploit chain can be</font>

757
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:34,939
broken at any time and it would stop

758
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:37,640
your pc from ransomware punch management

759
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,680
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important and you know people</font>

760
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,750
say that over and over and over but as

761
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,500
you can see yes that's really important

762
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:48,559
if the vulnerability is already

763
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:52,309
disclosed the bad guys would make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

764
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:55,730
profitable in less than three days so if

765
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:59,299
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it can wait no it's not</font>

766
00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:01,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">and user education and with ransomware</font>

767
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:05,690
it's really hard because for the average

768
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:09,740
user like most of the affected websites

769
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:11,779
where CNN com the angler was delivered

770
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:15,649
by the ad banners in the sky that

771
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:20,119
built-in in your OS now it's really

772
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:25,400
really hard to for<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user ID to not</font>

get like not become a victim however

important for the end user to know what

782
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:59,020
to do in this case is because we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

783
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:01,180
doing the incident report<font color="#CCCCCC"> where they got</font>

788
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:14,709
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot encrypted everything it can get</font>

789
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,870
to but if it will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> immediate reaction</font>

790
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:18,790
it might be stopped to like two or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

791
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:20,620
machines and the price for the

792
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:22,060
ransomware wouldn't be seventeen

793
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:29,770
thousand dollars but it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

794
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:33,520
500 Oh summary as we can see the

00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:37,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations responsible for particular</font>

796

exploit kit but they're like oh if just

797
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:42,850
one exploit kit we're at nuclear exploit

798

<font color="#E5E5E5">killed there are neutrino they all</font>

799
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:47,770
shifting toward the ransomware I've seen

somewhere now it has deliver anything

00:45:52,570 --> 00:46:04,350
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it will stay here as a result</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">they are always ahead of us they always</font>

805
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:11,020
have something you for us to fight with

806

<font color="#E5E5E5">and the amount of users</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that impacted as</font>

807
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:20,530
huge findings point out to the like the

808
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:24,430
criminal organization that works at a

809
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:27,760
scale of a big company to monetize that

810
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:30,339
amount of bitcoins that they gather they

811
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:34,030
have to have a really really good chain

812
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:36,610
of cashing that out and that chain

813
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:38,170
couldn't be just simple of and consists

814
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:42,240
of one two or three people there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

815
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,240
probably hundreds<font color="#E5E5E5"> people involved in it</font>

816
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,420
with almost forty percent of the users

817
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:51,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">hitting handler being compromised that's</font>

818
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,100
pretty bad thread forty percent is a lot

819
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:55,170
if we can break it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to like one two</font>

820
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:58,259
or three percent that might be not big

821
00:46:55,170 --> 00:47:01,550
we might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it anymore but I</font>

822
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't see that happening is soon the</font>

823
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:05,760
security applications do not quickly

824
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:08,009
recognized ransomware<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

826
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:11,580
solution or any other solution it

827
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,520
doesn't know if you control that

828
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:19,380
encrypting that going on right now or

829
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:23,430
not and the details I'm not down to

830
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:26,250
their majority of us just because if it

831
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:30,270
happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some big company it hasn't</font>

832
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:34,560
it doesn't need to be disclosed as it

833
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:36,240
need to be with our bridges so one

834
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,549
company's got hit with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

835
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,250
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay ransom and didn't notify</font>

836
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:43,170
anybody and those bad guys will do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

837
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:45,060
over and over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and who knows if</font>

838
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:49,590
they wouldn't come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your company</font>

839
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:52,110
so for the forensic people it's hard to

840
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:54,180
because if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the incident</font>

841
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:59,160
response and nobody called you you can

842
00:47:54,180 --> 00:48:03,410
just get any data or even when you have

843
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,410
the chance to get data they already gone

844
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,760
and i think that's it

845
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:18,340
this is probably a very polished I'm

846
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:20,720
sorry to do but my understanding is

847
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:23,000
infected with the ransom it deletes all

848
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,069
your backgrounds and encrypts what's

849
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,060
left then<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you pay the money then</font>

850
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:32,420
it'll decrypt so is there a way in the

851
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:35,110
operating system<font color="#CCCCCC"> level to detect</font>

852
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:37,190
and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what encryption software I</font>

853
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:41,900
must I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know about encryption</font>

854
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:44,330
software but you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some kind of</font>

855
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:47,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">magazines</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now for example with the most</font>

856
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:53,029
recent ransomware as<font color="#CCCCCC"> logging it checks a</font>

857
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:56,180
certain keys in the registry as language

858
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:58,820
for example so if you have that setting

859
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:00,740
already set to like Russian for example

860
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:05,030
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are saved because it wouldn't</font>

861
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:07,279
encrypt anything so but to break the

862
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:09,980
actual encryption process I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

863
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:13,010
there is any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of solution another</font>

864
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:16,100
problem is that because the code is

865
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:20,300
injecting on the fly there are no that

866
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:26,089
many solution that can like money for

867
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:28,760
their integrity of your memory so yeah

868
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:31,430
other ways to stop it then just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

869
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,980
for like small parts like registry keys

870
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:35,690
or something else there is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

871
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:37,820
solution at this point and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is just</font>

873
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:43,780
other families using other techniques

874
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:47,870
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to entice them yes</font>

875
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:49,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">twix if you think the process of that</font>

876
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:51,440
these guys go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and setting up the</font>

877
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:54,770
shadow at the domain shadows is

878
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:57,470
automated now it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty</font>

879
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:59,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">much because like we can see that at</font>

880
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:02,810
least<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shadow domains using some kind</font>

881
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:05,060
of generating algorithms and it's been

882
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:07,910
around for a while I've never been used

883
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:10,340
just other case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they getting away</font>

884
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:14,390
from that because that anything that I

885
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:16,220
can be generated would have a seat edges

886
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:18,799
the matter of time and the matter of

887
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:20,899
data we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can gather to get that seed but</font>

888
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,880
as soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we discover</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the seed we can</font>

889
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:27,510
search for the patterns and block the

890
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:31,200
shadows right away if

891
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:33,390
so the rents were that you see the

892
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,879
encryption process like how is it doing

893
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:37,200
like file selection for example or like

894
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,530
how long does it take to actually

895
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,480
perform the encryption so to perform the

896
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:45,030
encryption depends on how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> files do</font>

897
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:49,410
you have we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> four targets it I</font>

898
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:52,590
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the target extensions in</font>

899
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:56,160
the malware from my experience to

900
00:50:52,590 --> 00:51:02,250
encrypt 30 gigabytes of data it takes

901
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:04,109
about 15 seconds so and it also depends

902
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:07,680
how fast your machine I'm pretty sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

903
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:09,840
will get like this service in the group

904
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:13,500
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> Samson happen to the hospital</font>

905
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:17,000
their entire network cut encrypted in

906
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,000
less than an hour

907
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,030
okay thank you
