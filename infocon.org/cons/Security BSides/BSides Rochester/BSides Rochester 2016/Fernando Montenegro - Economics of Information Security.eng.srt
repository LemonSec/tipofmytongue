00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">here why is we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about this</font>

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,500
what's why economics what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going</font>

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,310
to talk about this it's the notion that

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,090
in when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about security in</font>

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,800
general we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the all the</font>

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,649
technical aspects<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it there is</font>

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else going on as well and at</font>

12
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the day there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">technical elements to what we're doing</font>

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,850
but there's also the non technical stuff

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,270
this is a non technical talk if you will

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,360
and what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're talking</font>

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,760
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how humans interact right economic</font>

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,320
fundamentally is the study of scarce and

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,218
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that in a second and this</font>

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,559
plays a part here because resources are

21
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,199
not infinite attention is not infinite

22
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,530
the incentives of why people do things

23
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,270
are very well defined in economics and I

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,189
think that as security professionals if

25
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,149
we understand that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a</font>

26
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:17,908
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more success as a as a profession</font>

27
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:20,880
this is the topic from this from this

28
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,640
presentation derived from a MOOC I took

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,619
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EDX a little while ago called</font>

30
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,210
economics of information security which

31
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,549
I thought were extremely interesting so

32
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,710
this is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so much a lecture as</font>

33
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,390
a almost like a book report and what do

34
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,030
they come across<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put a little bit of</font>

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">i added of what i added before people</font>

36
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,900

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,680
need to their what they'll have

40

additional content on the slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> event</font>

that they're not here as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so a</font>

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,689
little bit about me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm currently a</font>

services roles I've been some operations

47
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,310
I've done some architecture as it says

48
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:08,649
here my degrees from 94 which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I right to</font>

52
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,310
for a long time I'm why<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they giving</font>

53
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,988
this talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and economics because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I find a</font>

54
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,730
topic that you extremely interesting and

55
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:23,620
I think in that I urge you as you

56
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,480
consider your own careers and you

57
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,970
consider doing presentations and stuff

58
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,060
do that I mean offensively a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wife come</font>

59
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,040
up and talk I<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly curious about</font>

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,569
finance<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'ma do it yourself in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tests or</font>

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything and eventually about this thing</font>

62
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">called a mortgage what the heck is that</font>

63
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,959
and then try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out from there I</font>

64
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,310
like economics there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of areas</font>

65
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,860
or what is the efficient market

66
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,569
hypothesis and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other one is behavior</font>

67
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,890
economics and behavior onyx will play a

68
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:53,230
part here in a second and then and then

69
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,238
data science<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so I'm a few hours</font>

70
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,590
away from a capstone and preserve and

71
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,190
they'll be done with that the

72
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,540
specialization let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sorry</font>

73
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,540
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> checking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the slides here a little</font>

74
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,720
cough that's better so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

75
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,760
a little bit about economics economics

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,799
as a discipline has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

77
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,358
people have looked at for thousands of

78
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,350
years it was part of philosophy

79
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:20,560
originally but then especially in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in</font>

80
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,930
the late 1700s kind of thing it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">classed as a as a discipline more of its</font>

82
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,670
own some people here may have heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam</font>

83
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">Adam Smith is the guy who came up with</font>

84
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,280
the

85
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,200
ocean of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> invisible hand of the</font>

86
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,200
market right so what they were doing

87
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:38,619
that the market kind of arrangers itself

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,329
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what people will do what so</font>

89
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,090
death was a book called The Wealth of

90
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,130
Nations in 1776 what people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

91
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,530
is that Adam Smith or I don't know much

92
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,970
is that in 1759 they published a book

93
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,310
called the theory of moral sentiment

94
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,960
which is very interesting because the

95
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,630
Theory of Moral Sentiments dealt more

96
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,810
with the motivations for why people do

97
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,640
things and it's interesting that 200 300

98
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:04,000
years later or discussion some of that

99
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,269
in behavior economics moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> up very</font>

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,580
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how in terms of where people</font>

101
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">work an economics that have developed as</font>

102
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:16,299
a kind of developed in two major trends

103
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,500
macro and micro go back to those<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

104
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,380
second throughout the 18th and 19th

105
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,600
century I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out a couple</font>

106
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,810
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people Jeremy Bentham is interesting</font>

107
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">interest one of the topics to discuss is</font>

108
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,940
that charity event<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've introduced the</font>

109
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,860
notion of the panopticon which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> he is</font>

110
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,330
a guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Parisian develop like a prison</font>

111
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,250
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would have someone in the</font>

112
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,130
center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you could watch all around it</font>

113
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,860
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> argue that Jeremy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bentham is</font>

114
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,600
kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inspiration if you will</font>

115
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,340
for a lot of the security monitoring do

116
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,560
nowadays at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the model we want to watch</font>

117
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:51,520
what everything's everyone is doing and

118
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,110
then déjà Ricardo was interesting

119
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,490
because he introduced the notion or he

120
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,890
discussed the notion of comparative

121
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,300
advantage with what's comparative

122
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:02,289
advantage right so you have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

123
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:05,500
they both threw a tax<font color="#E5E5E5"> a and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> passed be</font>

124
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:08,290
and person number one is better a half a

125
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,870
and attack speed than person<font color="#CCCCCC"> number two</font>

126
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,660
it's still in the benefit for both

127
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,390
people one and two for one of them to

128
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,120
specialize in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

129
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:20,520
the other and I'm butchering economic

130
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">fire as I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned but it's the notion</font>

131
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:27,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that introduces specialization so as a</font>

132
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,030
as a as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole we've been we've been</font>

133
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:33,270
refining the science of economics for a

134
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:35,039
few years again<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

135
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,450
nineteenth and twentieth century you

136
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,040
started the discussion around what is

137
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:43,229
what should government be doing how

138
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,550
should you stimulate an economy not some

139
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:49,290
of you may have heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> John Maynard</font>

140
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:51,900
Keynes John Maynard Keynes if I would

141
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,670
say the philosophical inspiration for

142
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,340
the quantitative easing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as in the commonly since 2008</font>

144
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,320
prices the idea that you can boost

145
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,630

would nominate these two guys now

00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,860
there's two areas to economics the first

one the two major areas to economics

213
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,050
first point is macroeconomics and and

214
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:00,269
then realizing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need and</font>

macroeconomic if this study of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

216
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:05,160
broader economy like how how is going

<font color="#E5E5E5">how is the money supply going to affect</font>

the the aconnick outfit of a nation and

219
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,830
so on it's not as interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us from</font>

a<font color="#CCCCCC"> shoe</font>

a as the economy<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes into an expansion</font>

223
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,730
or contraction that<font color="#E5E5E5"> affects budgets and</font>

224
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,469
what have you it is interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

225
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,850
does study things like an employment

226
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,930
unemployment as it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

227
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,160
unemployment is interesting there's

228
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,900
different elements to an employment

229
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,020
there's frictional unemployment cyclical

230
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,579
and and structural<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that role play a</font>

231
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,520
part in security later on but that's

232
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,790
that's macroeconomics microeconomics is

233
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,189
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more interesting microeconomics is</font>

234
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,680
the other major branch of economics and

235
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:49,550
that's the study of scarcity it's the

236
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,739
study of how people in a particular

237
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,410
interaction are going to look for the

238
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,110
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> outcome in a transaction it's the</font>

239
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,480
FFF here to the study of individuals or

240
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,180
market when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear the notion of</font>

241
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,640
supply and demand yes it plays a part in

242
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,060
macro as well but here is where people

243
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're analyzing how people are</font>

244
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,900
maximizing their own utility in other

245
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,490
words you're trying to in a particular

247
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,410
yourself that's the that's the theory

248
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> microeconomics is where you</font>

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,520
find this ocean of disgusting

00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,589
information economics and and both

251
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:29,550
decision in game theory so it is

252
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:31,560
extremely interesting from that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

253

security effects economics that's where

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:40,590
you're going to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself most of</font>

256
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:43,050
the time it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a formal part of</font>

257
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:45,540
economics but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that behavioral</font>

258
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,770
economics is absolutely essential as a

<font color="#E5E5E5">security professional for you to</font>

260
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:55,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">understand behavior economics is more a</font>

261
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:58,230
multidisciplinary field if you will that

262
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">includes psychology it includes finance</font>

263
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:04,470
it includes economics it includes

264
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:06,870
sociology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's as the title says</font>

265
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,910
there it's a funny expression is the

266
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,400
bounded rationality of economic aid

267
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:14,610
which basically is a very nice way of

268
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:17,040
saying people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not rational we don't</font>

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">always maximize your not always trying</font>

to

271
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,540
you're not always calculating the

00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:24,569
maximum payoff for a particular

273
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,209
transaction we have our inherent biases

274
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:30,959
and will act on those biases and

275
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:34,260
behavior economics is a way of analyzing

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and looking at how we can factor</font>

that in as you develop systems for this

behavior economics it was started in the

00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:18,450
biases and these are biases that we have

study of these biases and also intended

301
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:47,790
how do you incentivize people to do

anyway that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best behavior</font>

the stock market you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

308
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,270
labor market well a market is more of a

model<font color="#E5E5E5"> than anything else it's how you're</font>

310
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:08,370
going to interact you analyze how people

311
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,140
interact and in the market you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">something called the price and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the price</font>

is a very signal on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that market to</font>

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,150
not produce and a market smarter social

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:22,119
is it more for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this example</font>

317
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,680
talk to a perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> description of things</font>

318
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,960
but it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good approximation and</font>

319
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,140
remember i mentioned the brewer and

320
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:32,650
arrow fruit flies back well they kind of

321
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:35,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">proved that for some definition of</font>

322
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,959
people being better off a market is a

323
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:41,230
very efficient way of achieving that

324
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,660
buying and selling good so how do you

325
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,880
get an efficient market which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

326
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,740
for exactly the number of things have to

327
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen you need to have lots of people</font>

328
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">buying and selling you need to have</font>

329
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,840
what's called property rights the notion

330
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:58,240
that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I buy something I get the full</font>

331
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,460
benefit of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if I sell something</font>

332
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,830
I get the full benefit of death and buy

333
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,610
in there did I also pay the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs</font>

334
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:08,740
so it's right I i received i got the

335
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,350
full I the first property<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights for a</font>

336
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,240
particular transaction you assume that

337
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is perfect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information people know</font>

338
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,630
what they're buying is felling you

339
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,339
assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are rational pay you</font>

340
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,470
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a little bit rate and</font>

341
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,110
you assume things like all transaction

342
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,180
costs and end that as it says here non

343
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,190
increasing returns to scale we are going

344
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,319
to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few slides how all of</font>

this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> different in the security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

346
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,600
information security specifically if you

347
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,310
don't have those conditions you have

348
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,950
what are called market failures and they

349
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:44,079
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the market crash you hold</font>

350
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,760
your thought I will get non decreasing

351
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,030
returns to scale you'll see that in a

352
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:54,970
second it's the notion that you're born

353
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:58,180
that as you get a larger you're a cost

354
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,860
at some point will rise again hold that

355
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,430
hold that thought thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

356
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,020
question do you have market fingers if

357
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,880
you don't have a large number of buyers

358
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and seller if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's called</font>

359
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,320
of an opera or a monopsony right<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

360
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,900
monopsony is when you have fewer buyers

361
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,610
that you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need and we all know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

362
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,040
all heard of monopolies and there is

363
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:22,810
several negative things to monopolise

364
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:24,829
but what I will say is that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me from</font>

365
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">an economic perspective</font>

366
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:30,029
permissions respected monopolies are

367
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,740
interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the triangle is to</font>

368
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:34,740
impress discrimination of buying of

369
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,290
selling you something for what you can

370
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,070
bear to pay and not necessarily what did

371

<font color="#CCCCCC">you what they are willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

372
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,930
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell you a ten dollar</font>

373

bottle of what is a ten dollar bottle

374
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,279
wine i'll sell it to you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty</font>

375
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:52,019
because i know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can pay property</font>

376
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,910
rights if you don't have property right

377
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,430
to get into what's called an externality

378
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:58,969
and that's the notion that you make an

379
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:01,170
economic decision but you are not

380
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,720
responsible for the costs associated

381
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,060
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that decision the typical example</font>

382
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,940
we always talk about this pollution

383
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:11,939
radiation pollute you may not by

384
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,860
definition you're not you're not bearing

00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,769
the full cost of that pollution<font color="#CCCCCC"> red</font>

386
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,350
society as a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and that has very</font>

387
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:21,570
interesting consequences because that

388
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,639
leads to things such as free writing

389
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,690
right people in fact not paying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

390
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,010
cost of pollution i'll just keep

what's my incentives what's my economic

394
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,649
incentives do not do that and there's

395
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,329
also positive there's also positive

396

other market failures that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

404
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,480
is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have information about</font>

what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into what's</font>

called information asymmetry you don't

407
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,740
know

408
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:10,580
tales about what you're buying on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

409
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:14,540
selling that leads to things such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">zit severe adverse selection what this</font>

411
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,839
is particularly interested in the field

412
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:22,579
of insurance right what<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends up</font>

413
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:25,010
happening if you buy a if you we<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze</font>

414
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,139
and say that hey listen if only sick

415
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,290
people sorry it should succeed but if

416
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,700
only sick people will go and buy

417
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,470
insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the market it's too</font>

418
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,970
expensive for a healthy person to join

419
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,470
so the frequence are going to be higher

420
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,840
well as the things are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be hired</font>

421
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,490
in only if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sick I you're</font>

going to pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and that's it and</font>

423
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,800
that's a negative feedback if you will

424
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,350
there's a few others we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

462
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,220
haven't produced much so your cost per

463
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,139
unit is pretty high as you have to set

464
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,910
at the factory and you start hiring

465
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,910
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't produce as much</font>

467
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:41,059
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a groove and now your</font>

marginal<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost and it gets to where</font>

you're producing well let cetera at some

then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start paying overtime</font>

472
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:52,230
maybe you need maybe your suppliers

don't have as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the good as much</font>

476
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,150
your your your marginal<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost increases</font>

477
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,520
at that point in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd probably</font>

open up another<font color="#E5E5E5"> factory and so on this</font>

increase in return to scale right and

488
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,870
this has extremely interesting

489
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:38,850
consequences for its for softer markets

490
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:40,439
why well if you have it in that in that

491
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,959
curve where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just showed you you</font>

492
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,430
have very high fixed cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very low</font>

493
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,220
marginal costs what this means is

494
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:51,430
it introduces the notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this kind</font>

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of market will tend to forget security</font>

00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,880

498

500
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,560
fast as they can right so this is this

501
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,090
market is prone to monopolies well if

502
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,490
that market is Prince of an operative

503
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,260
then we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting to a strong incentive</font>

504
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,410
for that company to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into our market</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">rates to have first mover advantage time</font>

506
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,910
to market becomes essentially getting

00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:28,210

can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security why because</font>

hard to measure security is something

513

that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fort it</font>

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as an industry we should start</font>

saying all this software companies are

522
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,149
they they're stupid for not fixing bugs

523
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,040
with each other it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

524
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,410
in their economic interest and

525
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,940
absolutely rationale for them to do so

526
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that's the underlying message here</font>

527
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,560
now what I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover is that</font>

528
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:18,520
there's a ton of other things as well

529
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,830
you have notions that in once you get to

530
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,510
despite if you start appealing it's

531
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,280
irrational interest to appeal to

532
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">complimentary goods you build a platform</font>

533
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,080
and you build around it how many deer

interesting consequences or how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you</font>

574
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:07,480
analyze this how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get information</font>

575
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:09,279
about a particular there were two

576
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,749
mechanisms once called signaling the

577
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,580
other ones called screen one was from

578
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:14,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">stiglitz the other one was from Spanish</font>

579
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,629
I forget which one was which I bet

580
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:19,269
expense for signaling and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stiglitz</font>

581
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:22,748
were screaming in signal you what you do

582
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:25,869
is you whether you try to signal to your

583
00:24:22,749 --> 00:24:29,379
buyer that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your good has higher quality</font>

584
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:32,320
in screening if you are the buyer you

585
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:34,330
try to screen out as your sellers so

586
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,460
that only good sellers are going to

587
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:39,428
eventually make it through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

588
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:42,669
not perfect signals well these are not

589
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:43,640
perfect magnet in no other word for the

590
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:47,510
word signal

591
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,520
it's certified right so if you getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

592
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,430
certification is nothing more than

593
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">providing a signal that you know what I</font>

594
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,840
have some level of quality as you can

595
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,370
see as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can imagine this has</font>

596
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,260
tremendous consequences in the

597
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:03,050
information security all my product is

598
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,550
certified and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot this also leads to</font>

599
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:06,580
interesting scenarios where sometimes

600
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:09,260
the certification process gets abused

601
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,970
I'm still very curious what's going to

602
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,650
happen and i love the notion of the

603
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:15,560
legend crafts movement that we now

604
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,970
everybody can have ssl cert but what's

605
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,280
the consequence of that from a strictly

606
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,740
perspective for the quality for this for

607
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,040
the security of a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> significant</font>

608
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,780
anyway that signal screening has another

00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,480
game anybody here working for a vendor

610
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:32,540
software vendor or service vendor like I

have these are just examples of that

being implemented in insecurity jumping

00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,500
into security areas themselves any one

describes the dynamic of the market

00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:28,040
pretty well security goods are

632
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,140
insufficient information it means that

633
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the buyers don't really know what you're</font>

00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">buying and the sellers they have some</font>

635

idea of what they're selling but not

636
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:38,390
that much as well right so you end up

637
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,570
dead

638
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:43,730
about the markets<font color="#E5E5E5"> I then on the signals</font>

and not on the security list off in

640
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:49,160
other words you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for some</font>

641
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,650
external evidence of some that funding

643
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:57,200
don't buy into the actual security of a

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:15,590
whenever there is an incident everybody

extremely relevant other areas software

656
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,010
development by itself i mentioned this

00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:35,719
briefly earlier there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a tremendous</font>

658
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:40,370
there's a tremendous failure derivative

659
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:42,410
of getting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first emergency we get</font>

660
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,689
into issues of information city through

661
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:47,120
this is the paper that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ross Anderson</font>

662
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,390
wrote back in 2001 the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gap got</font>

663
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,669
the whole economics of security going

664
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:55,430
how hard is it to tell if a product is

665
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:57,290
secure or not it's very difficult so

666
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:59,690
it's the rational expectation of a

667
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:02,060
software vendor together with us as

668
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:05,570
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they possibly can and for us</font>

670
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:10,300
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dexa message I'm trying to</font>

671
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:12,620
get across here there's if there's

672
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,510
significant externalities in software

673
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:17,600
development in the hole all of the free

674
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:19,580
open-source movement in openssl how many

675
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,679
people actually use openssl versus how

676
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:24,290
many people contribute to it that's your

677
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:28,240
typical free writing that comes from an

678
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:30,820
externality right and if you

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> owners of patchy right why do we get</font>

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:46,480
people to expect people to change you

687
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,260
to this lecture right well why I find

688
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:56,650
economics so interesting how we're going

689
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:59,170
to solve this well realistically never

690
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,720
mind as you like it or not the economic

691
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:05,980
approach to solving an externality is

692
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,929
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example regulation so we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

693
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,679
to see more regulation security is not

00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:16,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">because people are evil it's because</font>

released the late last year that at some

00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:27,250
point there were in eighty-seven percent

least one high risk for their ability

701
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:35,800
for a large period of time why is this

702
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:37,950
because it was not in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone</font>

703
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:42,129
manufacturer or your service providers

704
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:44,440
interest they were not incentive to fix

705
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,240
it to push that vulnerability out now

706
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,380
Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> may have fixed it very quickly</font>

707
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,600
but the model itself is not it doesn't

708
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,730
it doesn't even sent the service

709

provider or the carrier sorry sir the

710
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,870
provider are the four manufactures

711
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,970
reporter to push that upgrade out so

712
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:04,540
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example of why externalities</font>

713
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:07,480
play a part in security now another

714
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:11,080
interesting areas in vulnerability by

price a vulnerability has been a part of

718
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,590
economics or a part of the economics of

719
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:21,810
security since pretty much when it

720
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,270
started

721
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:26,490
if you had the initial argit's where I

defense and tipping points would buy for

723
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:32,310
their abilities and that has extremely

724
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:34,800
interesting economic consequences first

725
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:39,060
of all it lowers the transaction costs

726
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:41,280
for a for a buying and selling of

727
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:44,520
vulnerability if I know that I can go to

728
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,470
some place and felt that it's easier for

729

00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:25,020
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment that you introduced this</font>

vulnerability being fixed are going to

749
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,220
give it to apple or you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,990
if you could sell the vulnerability only

what are you going to do about it what

what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me about the price</font>

760
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,600
it's someone's going to pay for that and

761
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,430
there's and i really recommend that you

762
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,219
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the work that the likes of</font>

bugcrowd they're doing and hacker 102 in

764
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,410
terms of bug bounties it's extremely

765
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,790
interesting but i like but proud a lot

766
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,520
they've been doing some very interesting

767
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:15,990
work in solving that information is

research privacy is another huge area in

774
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:39,740
terms of economics of privacy I

actually behave so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example I talk</font>

they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about monopolies</font>

risk management is pretty much economic

invest in security there is an

803
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,300
interesting model of the Gordon web

804
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,120
model that tells you that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

805
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,440
should you should really apply for a

particular to fix a particular

807
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:00,620
vulnerability thirty-seven percent of

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> your expected loss and it will go</font>

809
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:05,179
through the calculation there's a

810
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:07,430
there's a battle going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on between</font>

811
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,889
qualitative and quantitative risk

management people love their they are

813
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:13,569
highly involved in research and all the

814
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:16,570
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> love their statistics based</font>

probability-based

816
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:21,739
calculations this is ever you can do

817
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:24,078
with how much you're going to invest

818
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:28,439
informational symmetry plays a huge part

819
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,339
1 of the air is I I didn't cover too

820
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,289
much is what's called the

821
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:34,020
principal-agent problem in economics and

822
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:36,119
that is if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two people in you</font>

823
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,679
are the principal and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an agent</font>

824
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on your behalf</font>

825
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,839
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an informational symmetry in</font>

826
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:45,328
that you don't know what that agent is

827
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:48,989
actually doing there is an incentive for

828
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:51,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">that agent to act on their self-interest</font>

829
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:55,979
more than your as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> principal this is</font>

830
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:59,910
why I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> picking on particular fields</font>

831
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:01,650
but for example real estate so if you

832
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,569
are if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real estate agent</font>

833
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:06,569
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> research that sells that</font>

834
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:09,089
you sell your house for more than you

835
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:10,558
tell a comparable persons houses and you

836
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:12,900
leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the market</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for longer that's</font>

837
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:16,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> freakonomics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff earlier on why is</font>

838
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:19,380
that because hey your your your interest

839
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,460
of selling then your house is<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

840
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,309
than when you're selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own first</font>

841
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,720
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> selling someone else's the</font>

842
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:26,069
same thing applies in our area is the

843
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,589
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to mention here is that</font>

844
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:30,779
I've been in many audits security audits

845
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:34,140
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaders and one of the one</font>

846
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:35,940
cases I've heard cases I've seen is you

847
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,799
come up again with<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's up on their</font>

848
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,950
own video<font color="#CCCCCC"> camera what's the findings on</font>

849
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:44,250
an audit high medium low finally I've

850
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:46,259
seen people argue more not for fixing

851
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">their vulnerability but for</font>

852
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:51,539
reclassifying it not as a high but as a

853
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,400
medium why do they do that well<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

854
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:55,559
only high vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> get bumped up</font>

855
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,539
to management right so that's a

856
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,490
principal-agent problem at play here

857
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:01,559
right and if you don't understand that

858
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,118
you're over<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did the fix all that of</font>

859
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,690
course not they were not incentive to do

860
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:10,020
so insurance for another huge area could

861
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:12,270
get into a lot more I've done fraud

862
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,050
prevention for a number of years and I

863
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,520
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cybercrime is a</font>

864
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,940
extremely interesting area from an

865
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,680
economic perspective you have the whole

866
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,270

875
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:44,890
discussion underground markets are

876
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,170
tremendously interesting it I wish you

877
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:48,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">could I think that session that lead</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">will be on underground market alone</font>

879
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:52,810
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called the Red Queen</font>

880
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:54,640
hypothesis in the car and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

881
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:57,370
fact that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't evolve you die</font>

882
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,560
and we see that happening in underground

883
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:02,290
markets all the time right you see

884
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,290
prices for exploits dropping over time

885
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:06,700
because they get more efficient here

886
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:10,270
underground markets are extremely

887
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:12,009
efficient in which this is interesting

888
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,200
for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze not because you want</font>

889
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:16,360
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily close your technicals on</font>

the economic objective of the your

892
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:23,860
attacker is maybe you can try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix</font>

893
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:26,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that issue as a both necessarily a</font>

894
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:29,170
technical issue and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are tons of</font>

895
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,570
other externalities this would not be a

896
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:34,420
presentation in 2016 if I did not

897
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:36,820
include ransomware right so here if the

898
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,500
rent the mandatory rest of his life the

899
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,030
thing about ransomware that's extremely

900
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,460
interesting from an economic perspective

901
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:44,530
is that up until<font color="#E5E5E5"> now why does anyone</font>

902
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">care about this why did this thing blow</font>

903
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:49,030
up as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it did and it's going to</font>

904
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:51,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep blowing up because from an economic</font>

905
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:55,300
perspective two things happened number

906
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:58,420
one it's now the criminal element found

907
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,920
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy way to monetize it where as</font>

908
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,350
before if they broke into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your machine</font>

909
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,480
and they are able to to get remote

910
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:06,730
execution they will use you as spam

911
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,359
platform and sell out in

912
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:12,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">she'll spam is to do that better but now</font>

913
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:14,560
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can charge 400 bucks for your</font>

914
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:17,109
machine to do something so its bigger

915
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,330
economic incentives to do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

916
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:21,400
this is what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why I ransomware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

917
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,840
picked up so much look the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

918
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,200
about that they're real quick is just

919
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,600
that the ransomware they actually have

920
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,740
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> behave as a legit business in order</font>

921
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,460
for people to actually get comfortable

922
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">paying rent so it speaks to right thank</font>

923
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,810
you it's big factor that red flame

924
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,270
hypothesis here today if you as a mouth

925
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:42,580
as a ransomware a platform if you don't

926
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how to behave people are not going</font>

927
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,430
to trust you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are not going to</font>

928
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,350
pay and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to not do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

929
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,359
think press over is extremely

930
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:52,600
interesting in a morbid sense reported

931
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:55,990
in the sense that it brought it brings

932
00:38:52,600 --> 00:39:00,400
back to the user some of the owners of

933
00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:03,399
doing security you do most people

934
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't care I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean when you talk to</font>

935
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they may want to say</font>

936
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,220
necessarily care oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes I medicine is</font>

937
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:11,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">stand for my account I don't care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

938
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:14,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">some I may have to be I may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to pay</font>

939
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,330
400 500 bucks I do care<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm still</font>

940
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,880
curious to see what the long-term effect

941
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,470
is going to be of ransomware on user

942
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,359
perceptions of security I think that's

943
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:26,589
an interesting area to do research over

944
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:28,779
the next year or so right which brings

945
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,520
us to security awareness I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

946
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,920
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing anything to do it security</font>

947
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,509
awareness for your user community you

948
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,670
absolutely must understand behavior

949
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:39,790
economics you absolutely should

950
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:42,790
understand that people have their their

951
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:44,590
biases and I urge you to please do not

952
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,570
treat your users<font color="#E5E5E5"> are stupid they are not</font>

953
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,130
stupid they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing when they don't</font>

954
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:50,500
follow your security advice they're

955
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:53,740
doing the exactly rational thing to do

956
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,750
there's a fantastic paper by<font color="#CCCCCC"> korn a</font>

957
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:58,750
speculative higher rate from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft I</font>

00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:01,619
had on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mountain foods later called</font>

959
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:05,339
the so long and no thanks for the

960
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:07,559
pronounce the papers from 2086 today but

961
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:09,749
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a little dated in the</font>

962
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:11,880
examples that he gives in terms of span

963
00:40:09,749 --> 00:40:15,689
and things like that they just fantastic

964
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:18,509
paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> arguing that people ignoring</font>

965
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:21,630
security advice is absolutely the

966
00:40:18,509 --> 00:40:22,859
rational thing for them to do so we tell

967
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:25,319
people hey listen you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should pay</font>

968
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:26,819
attention to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS on the on the</font>

969
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:29,970
browser oh by the way you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should check</font>

970
00:40:26,819 --> 00:40:31,349
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if the domain is a valid for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

972
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:36,119
is the certificate has an expert and so

973
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:39,569
on and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> on all that has an</font>

974
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:42,420
economic cost and on aggregate people

975
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:44,220
are rational when they ignore it and if

976
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,140
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't take that into account when we</font>

977
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,720
write security policy when we write and

978
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:52,558
user documentation we're just setting

979
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,569
ourselves up for failure great the same

980
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing about the the principal-agent</font>

981
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:58,319
problem applies here as well I mean

982
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:01,650
people active<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their self-interest</font>

983
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:04,710
it's 5 p.m. on the friday and you have

984
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:07,349
to send a file out to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

985
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:09,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">the file out to your partner's somewhere</font>

986
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:13,710
else are you really going to go through

987
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:16,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">the trouble of setting up but figured</font>

00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:17,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">file-sharing exchanging keys and whatnot</font>

989
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:21,569
are you're just going to have any nail

990
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:23,519
up right it's human behavior right it's

991
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:24,538
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> stupid it's the rational thing that</font>

992
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,669
they're doing from an economic

993
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:27,660
perspective may not be what you want but

994
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:30,210
it's the rational thing that they're

995
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,129
doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just an example that came</font>

996
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:34,230
from google<font color="#CCCCCC"> west year on the kind of</font>

997
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:36,630
things they've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address behavior</font>

998
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:40,200
economics in a little bit this was how

999
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:43,559
chrome used to do this was how chrome

1000
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,569
used to do a warning you see that they

1001
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:48,150
had multiple levels of<font color="#E5E5E5"> warning and they</font>

1002
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:50,609
simplify that on<font color="#E5E5E5"> chrome free search why</font>

1003
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:53,400

1004
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:56,880
they found through a data focused

1005
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,190
analysis that people were not paying as

1006
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,040
much attention to

1007
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:03,200
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of errors here right there's an</font>

1008
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,990
interesting study on your human behavior

called the paradox of choice and if I

1012
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,150
they analyzed whether people would buy

1013
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:16,280
more if you give them six choice six

1014

choices of jam or whether you give them

1015
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:22,280
24 choices of them and jam and people

1016
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:25,580
were literally choosing to buy less if

1017
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,770
they had more choice that's kind of

1018
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:30,380
thinking of life here I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wrap up</font>

maybe we do this introduces<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

that i recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like i have a</font>

1040
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,030
same advice for security people where

it's a programming learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to automate</font>

discussion of information asymmetry

1044

applies here as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

you are a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good security professional</font>

1047
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,230
well one of the ways is credential from

1048
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:41,990
you get your university degree you get

1049

1052
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:50,440
right this is the rational way of

<font color="#E5E5E5">leading of dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the information</font>

the screening perspective we should

expect interviews to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

incentive for someone to cheat their way

1067
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:27,670
into security is higher as well and this

1068
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:31,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of dry is why you have a</font>

certification paper mills and whatnot

1070
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,330
and this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons why the</font>

1071
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,090
interviews are getting tougher and

1072
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:41,529
tougher and tougher anyway just to wrap

1073
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:43,150
up we look at the few broader economic

1074

not understand the incentives behind the

absolutely focus on the right levers

I'll leave you with one final time which

1129
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:58,890
is isn't a lot of what we do in security

1130
00:46:55,349 --> 00:47:00,930
nowadays itself an externality in other

1131
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:03,960
words we are asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> people hey listen</font>

1132
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:06,598
you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not do this and we make that</font>

1133

as a dick that and people yet you should

1134
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:14,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">not you can only use to prove whatever</font>

1135
00:47:11,749 --> 00:47:16,049
people are going to rationally look for

1136
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,749
a way around it people i want to

1137
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:22,680
rationally ignore<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and we shouldn't do</font>

1138
00:47:18,749 --> 00:47:25,890
that thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for listening</font>

1139

to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do have the slides up in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you may have yes sir you mentioned</font>

1143
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:38,960
underground which I played I see me

1144
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:42,710
criminal markets are extremely efficient

1145
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:46,940
why do they experience or lesser market

1146
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:49,400
failures so forgiving you the question

1147
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:52,280
is why do underground markets experience

1148
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">fear fewer failures than traditional</font>

1149
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,080
markets that's a question that I would

1150
00:47:55,250 --> 00:48:01,280
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this happens because the</font>

1151
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:03,529
markets they have fewer fewer of those
