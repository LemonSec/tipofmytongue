you have questions I would be happy to

answer them in a more private setting

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,589
I've been working on cryptography policy

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different I'm going to talk a</font>

little bit about the past about how we

got here about where we are what's

25
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,479
happening and what has just happened and

26
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,059
I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make some predictions and</font>

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,220
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future where I expect us</font>

a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit out beyond that one of the</font>

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,619
there were no anonymizing proxies we

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,000
barely had the first Inklings of TLS but

39
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,759
there were words and there were lots of

them and images and code<font color="#CCCCCC"> and politics</font>

41

encryption and its export was illegal

84
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,209
but there were no geo blocks there was

85
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,750
no IP fencing there was nothing like

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:59,840
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1990s and so the regulation</font>

ended up being an ineffectual<font color="#E5E5E5"> checkbox</font>

the export laws didn't apply anyone

contain the algorithm it only contained

108
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,180
a description of it and he was banned

109
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,270
from doing so the State Department

110
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,890
listed encryption on<font color="#E5E5E5"> itar or the arms</font>

and we sued the department of justice

for any of you following UK politics I

released a draft policy on encryption

that would have required everyone using

encryption to store plaintext for 90

236

days and cap key lengths at 64 bits on

they withdrew it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it can be</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hand over encryption codes that came out</font>

dark it got like

246
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:52,110
in the fall the president said he didn't

247
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,209
well he didn't actually say this this

248
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,060
was an official leaked to the Washington

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,149
leaks so if you see Ellen Nakashima

254

quoting unnamed administration sources

255
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:11,970
she is both right and that's official so

256
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,949
anyway this was an l a-- nakashima

257
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,379
article in The Washington Post that

258

Obama was quoted as saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we will</font>

requiring companies to decode messages

261
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:29,879
for law enforcement and of course

262
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:32,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a bullet there uh but Bloomberg</font>

263
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,860
leaked a national security council memo

264
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:38,279
from a little bit before when Obama said

265
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,589
this which was they are not going to

266
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:43,350
pursue legislation right now they're

267
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:46,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to instead wait for something big</font>

268
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,870
to happen that was some time around

Thanksgiving and of course something big

270
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,449
happened just a couple of weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> later in</font>

271
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:59,519
San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bernardino and we got Apple versus</font>

272
00:12:54,449 --> 00:13:02,040
FBI this I I can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about</font>

273
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,660
this the the legal geekery is of

274
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,550
interest pretty much only two lawyers um

275
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,620
but what was this case really about this

276
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,779
case was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the FBI wanting the</font>

277
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,579
ability to mandate that companies turn

00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:17,730
our devices into tools of surveillance

279
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:21,209
it was not about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one phone and it</font>

280
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:23,040
never was the national<font color="#E5E5E5"> security memo</font>

281
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:25,829
National Security Council memo that

282
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:30,569
Bloomberg leaked I think demonstrates

283
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:33,750
that quite well this was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tragedy</font>

284
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:35,699
that the DOJ is cynically exploited to

285
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:39,180
seek what they had been wanting for a

286

year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> half it's about a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> master key</font>

neither here nor there because it wasn't

legal precedent<font color="#E5E5E5"> Comey admitted so in</font>

under oath and a hearing in the house in

March they want the ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to demand</font>

302
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,160
that US tech providers stop providing

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:24,060
end-to-end encryption or secure device

304

305
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,459
win if they won in san bernardino they

306
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,079
would have an order that they could then

307
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,870
take two courts around the country and

308
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,300
get follow on orders to kill and end

309
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,100
encryption as we saw it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they lost</font>

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> San</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bernardino they could take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

311
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,280
loss to Congress and say look we don't

312
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:46,740
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the legal powers that we need</font>

313
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,480
there's also there also was a case in

314
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,050
the Eastern District of New York that

315
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,610
case went away last night at about 8pm

316
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,709
when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government gave up just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

317
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:59,010
they did on the eve of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing in</font>

318
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:01,650
San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bernardino uh the FBI strategy was</font>

319
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:04,620
flawed for three reasons first legally

320
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,270
what the FBI was asking for would have

321
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,820
represented a fundamental shift in the

322
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:12,060
way that American courts interpret the

323
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,100
all writs<font color="#CCCCCC"> Act no court for instance had</font>

324
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,709
ever ordered<font color="#CCCCCC"> brinks to create a master</font>

325
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,350
key that had never happened and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

326
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:23,220
essentially what FBI was asking Apple to

327
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:25,980
do here it was flawed technically we

328
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,100
barely know how to create secure systems

329
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,780
and if you think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one</font>

330
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,300
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent secure you're fooling</font>

331
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,790
yourself and everyone around you the

332
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,680
fact that FBI is demand seriously

333
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:42,870
demanding that we make our systems less

334
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,670
secure is insane to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> barely</font>

335
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,690
keep data out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands of people who</font>

336
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:51,420
shouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and to make that</font>

337
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:54,720
harder doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sense and it's</font>

338
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,949
flawed for policy reasons if FBI got

339
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,690
what it was asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> in San Bernardino</font>

340
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,580
it would have absolutely crippled

341
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,750
American business and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way</font>

342
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">that any one outside the US would buy</font>

343
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,320
devices that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they knew were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> backdoored</font>

344
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,000
and then foreign governments would

345
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,430
demand exact

346
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,550
the same access and Comey has no answer

347
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:17,000
for how to prevent that there's some

348
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:20,300
other litigation going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> too maybe we</font>

349
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,300
don't really know it's not all writs Act

350
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:26,300
litigation the New York<font color="#CCCCCC"> Times had a</font>

351
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:29,719
report that whatsapp which is owned by

352
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,250
Facebook is under a decryption order we

353
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,710
think that's not being actively

354
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,200
litigated we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're doing</font>

355
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:39,110
they have a wait-and-see stance there

356
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,110
but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know there may be</font>

00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,390
ficek orders we don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

358
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:47,000
are we've heard some rumors but they're

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,470
not particularly credible Ellen

360
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,520
Nakashima hasn't published an article in

361

The Washington Post thing that's

362
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:57,050
happened and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> this week we filed a</font>

363
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,300
Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to

364
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,800
demand answers on that and we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

365
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,890
actually have a pretty decent chance at

366
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,379
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the USA Freedom Act which was</font>

367
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,629
passed in June of last year requires

370
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:17,000
and this certainly would be are required

371
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:20,300
to be declassified so that's a that's

372

the the core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our lawsuit that we</font>

computers as we know them

395
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,530
because there's no way of keeping a

402
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:40,220
would demand I'm as a side I'm a

403
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:43,460
lifelong Californian and to see my

404
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,890
senators name up there is depressing um

405
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,020
and as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said burr Feinstein is</font>

406
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,230
problematic on every possible level it's

407
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,929
unconstitutional as we as we saw at the

408
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:57,080
beginning of this talk code is speech

409
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:59,570
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to ban and to end encryption</font>

410
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,149
including open source is a prior

411
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:04,700
restraint and I have a post up at eff

412
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,350
from last summer talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

413
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,940
exactly this bill would be

414
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,189
unconstitutional even though I hadn't

415
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,700
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months away from seeing the</font>

416
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:16,220
bill uh it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> break the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet as</font>

417
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,919
we know it I mean it would mandate that

418
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,970
everything be<font color="#CCCCCC"> decrypted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time and</font>

419
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:24,500
that's not just not how encryption works

420
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,510
it would cripple American business for

421
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,900
the reasons that I already discussed and

422
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,520
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be totally ineffective right</font>

423
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,130
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet interpret censorship is</font>

424
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,490
damaged and routes around it we can all

425
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:39,290
get PGP we all probably have and to

426
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:42,770
encrypt oh and there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

427
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:45,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">can do to change that fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is just</font>

428
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:50,840
a fact and law enforcement needs to

429
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:54,110
learn to<font color="#E5E5E5"> live with it so in 2016 what</font>

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looking at what so I've done</font>

Christmas past and Christmas present now

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,790
I'm going to do Christmas yet to come

433
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:05,120
what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we what are we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read what are we</font>

434
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:08,928
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> our options well we could do</font>

435
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:12,080
something like China and have a key

436
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:14,390
escrow mandate the New York Attorney

437
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,879
General has a key escrow mandate which

438
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:19,429
which was put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into effect last year for</font>

439
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,460
banks so banks that use secure

00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:25,040
communications within themselves

we're gonna get something maybe more

are the US government is going to go

after defaults not primitives what do I

mean by<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't care if people</font>

Rochester are capable of using PGP or

OTR they don't give<font color="#CCCCCC"> a crap about that</font>

535
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:29,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">what they care about is average</font>

536
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:34,650
Americans and they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deny average</font>

537
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:37,290
Americans there's digital security we

539
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:42,600
I don't think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to see a</font>

companies like Google Facebook and Apple

544
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,490
especially I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:07,409
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try as hard as they can</font>

550
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:11,130
to make those guys stop encrypting by

551
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:13,620
default and as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> any mandate that</font>

552
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,679
does pass will affect only the masses it

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,029
won't affect Isis it won't affect

554
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,730
international pedophile rings it won't

555
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:22,260
affect organized crime why because as I

556
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,539
said earlier anyone with a modicum of

557
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,220
sophistication is<font color="#E5E5E5"> free you script out</font>

558
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:33,330
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing anyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do about that</font>

559
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:35,940
uh and we might get court rulings for

560
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:38,250
the first time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that we were</font>

York the FBI pulled the plug on both of

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:49,919
those the that wasn't particularly

565
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:53,070
surprising to me but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't it wasn't</font>

566
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,720
exactly expected either so we haven't

567
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">gotten a court ruling on Krypto since</font>

the 90s we might get<font color="#E5E5E5"> one this year and</font>

00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,399
that's it

questions

571
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:28,110
um so okay so that's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

572
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,940
I'll repeat it for people who couldn't

573
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,889
hear being recorded to what extent is

574
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,720
the degradation degradation of security

575
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:38,179
for the masses harm us the people in

00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,990
people having the right to privacy on

583
00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:01,080
social movements don't start in public

584
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:04,380
they start in private having having

585
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:07,500
security for people who aren't tech

586
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:09,600
savvy is critical on that's the way that

587
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,840
social change works and security and

588
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,240
privacy are critical they're they're

589
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,059
prerequisites for democracy and without

590
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,530
security and privacy we can't have we

591
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:21,660
can't do the hard work that social

592
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:25,410
change requires the civil rights

593
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:27,390
movement almost ended because of j edgar

594
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,570
hoover and and ubiquitous surveillance

595
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:33,360
it almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended before it started and</font>

that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I'm I'm</font>

598
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,590
people around the world right if you're

do not in whatsapp is how they get it

605
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,490
right now my message is how they get it

606
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:03,299
right now you you can do security

607

<font color="#CCCCCC">the country and it might stick it might</font>

609
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:14,280
not but it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be ubiquitous</font>

610
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:20,150
otherwise you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you you can't</font>

611
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:20,149
get social change yeah

612
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:38,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah um there-there some legal there are</font>

613
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,260
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal differences so that would</font>

614
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:43,409
only that wouldn't those sorts of

615
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:47,400
requirements don't apply to products

616
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:48,810
they only apply to services<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's a</font>

617
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot easier to pass a law that says you</font>

can't provide a messaging service

619
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:55,530
without a back door than it is to say

620
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:57,960
you can't provide a messaging client

621
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:00,330
without a back door there's some stupid

622
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:13,430
First Amendment and due process reasons

623
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:15,659
why that's true yeah doesn't scale I

624
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:33,810
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might work on a one off but it</font>

625
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:36,330
doesn't scale um that's that's actually

626
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,429
a really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question maybe so we</font>

627
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't so things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tor messenger and</font>

628
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:44,550
pot don't use pond but<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> turn</font>

629
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:46,290
oh sure so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was right now it</font>

630
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,570
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the focus is on content but</font>

631
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:51,840
what about anonymizing or metadata

632
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:54,450
masking has FB<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started to attack that</font>

633
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the answer is no not yet because I think</font>

634
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">no one really uses it no one uses tour</font>

635
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:02,760
messenger or at least knowing that the

636
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:05,190
FBI cares about no one uses pond nor

637
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:09,360
should you because Adam hasn't updated

638
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:11,130
it in like a year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> half</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um but it</font>

639
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,639
that's possible that we might get

640
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:17,400
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw the the</font>

641
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,190
former head<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the CIA say that we kill</font>

642
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,710
people based on metadata right the NSA

643
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:26,610
in the CIA almost don't care about

644
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:28,860
content they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just care about when</font>

645
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:31,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">where and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two from they don't care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

646
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,790
the what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even need to know</font>

647
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,600
what's being said or even who's saying

648
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:37,030
it so long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as they</font>

649
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">the connections so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really about</font>

650
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:42,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">law enforcement law enforcement wants</font>

651
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,330
content intelligence agencies are fine

652
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:49,900
not getting content they're fine with

653
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:52,899
metadata yeah so we might get some

654
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:57,010
tension on anonymizing or metadata

655
00:30:52,900 --> 00:31:11,260
masking if those tools become useful at

656
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:13,870
scale they're not yet that's so that's

657
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,669
possible the question is heads<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in</font>

658
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,928
former heads of intelligence agencies

659
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:19,120
here in the states have come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

660
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:21,610
favor of encryption there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

661
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,459
reasons why stealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Keys is certainly</font>

662
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,899
one of them interestingly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ber</font>

00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">Feinstein bill is in the Senate</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the Intelligence</font>

667
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,770
Committee in the Senate is what's

668
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:40,870
pushing back doors even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though the</font>

669
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,990
intelligence community doesn't seem to

670
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,989
be

671
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:59,080
there's a there's this argument this

672
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">battle but the bigger problem I see a</font>

673
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,439
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I talk maybe aren't</font>

674
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,780
as technical they don't necessarily

675
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,790
understand why it's important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

676
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,770
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I often hear things like well</font>

677
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,110
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have anything to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hide then</font>

678
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:17,950
what's the big deal what do you what do

679
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:19,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think is the best argument or words</font>

680
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,930
of enlightening and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

681
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:25,540
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could all post on whatever forms we</font>

682
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:30,790
like to try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people overcome</font>

683
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:32,080
that so my my response<font color="#CCCCCC"> to if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

684
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,149
have anything to hide<font color="#E5E5E5"> why should I care</font>

685
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,740
about encryption is essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> what i</font>

686
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,320
said earlier about privacy it's not

687
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,000
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you it's about everybody else is</font>

688
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,220
and you have nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hide as</font>

689
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,590
irrelevant and there are people with

690
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:50,400
things to hide and that's a positive for

691
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:54,669
society the other the other response

692
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:57,100
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have is in 2013 according to a</font>

693
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:59,050
poll by<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDG and look out something like</font>

694
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,649
four million phones were lost or stolen

695
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:06,669
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. fully a quarter of those</font>

696
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:09,820
lost or stolen devices ended up causing

697
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:13,750
identity theft one quarter a million

698
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:15,250
phones a million Americans were victims

699
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:17,680
of identity theft because of lost or

700
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:19,510
stolen phones that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> true anymore</font>

701
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:23,620
with full disk encryption that has

702
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:25,300
stopped that's the other thing right if

703
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:30,750
FBI gets its way we're right back to

704
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:30,750
where we were all the way in<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

705
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:44,580
a great question do I see this trickling

706
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:46,559
down to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> States yes and no on two</font>

707
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:49,289
different levels so both California and

708
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,239
New York have proposed legislation that

709
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:54,359
would require phones sold in those

710
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:56,519
states to have back doors both of those

711
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:57,839
bills are unconstitutional because they

712
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:01,379
violate something called the dormant

713
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,668
Commerce Clause pretty cut-and-dried so

714
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:05,958
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to see legislation on</font>

715
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:08,789
the state level in terms of local

716
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:12,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">sheriff's and whatnot demanding the same</font>

717
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:13,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">access as FBI I mean sure they're going</font>

718
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask for it I don't think they're</font>

719
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:18,539
gonna get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right NSA has a whole lot</font>

720
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:21,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than FBI has and they don't share</font>

721
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:24,929
their toys I don't see FBI sharing its

722
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:46,169
toys with with local pd's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

723
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:48,210
i don't see of them yeah so coke yes so

724
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:50,368
code is speech but speech is the the

725
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:53,339
First Amendment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not absolute right so</font>

726
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:54,899
if a requirement and I'll go deep into

727
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:58,470
the law a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a second if a</font>

728
00:34:54,899 --> 00:35:00,750
requirement would affect speech based on

729
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:03,118
content which any end to end encryption

730
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,710
ban would then it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to meet what's</font>

731
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,359
called strict scrutiny so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

732
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,430
nailed narrowly tailored for a

733
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:10,650
compelling governmental interest narrow

734
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:14,640
tailoring means it has to be neither

735
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:17,940
over broad nor under broad here any ban

736
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,670
on Krypto would be both over broad and

737
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:22,410
under broad so saying code is speech

738
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,210
you're right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that doesn't</font>

739
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:26,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything sort of from an absolutist</font>

740
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:28,859
perspective but what it means is any

741
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:31,200
regulation on code is going to be

742
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:33,650
subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> to strict scrutiny and it</font>

743
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,649
wouldn't pass

744
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,580
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like recently planning on</font>

745
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:50,870
switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media companies their</font>

746
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:57,640
business model like they<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't get me</font>

747
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:57,640
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there was a recent forum</font>

748
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:05,950
yeah so that the quarry post has been

749
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,950
debunked but anyway let's eat another

750
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,890
sure so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is I yeah there is</font>

751
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:27,350
some end-to-end but really most things

752
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:29,799
are still just I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plaintext</font>

753
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:32,150
I'd say TLS and that's absolutely true

754
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,250
it's absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> true that Google has</font>

755
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,810
access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your gmail and they they are</font>

756
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,750
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep that forever because they</font>

757
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:41,680
want to scan it and display you ads same

758
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:44,660
with facebook Messenger the issue is

759
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,779
there is whether end-to-end encrypted

760
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:50,690
tools are legal right because if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

761
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:53,870
not that has huge trickle-down effects

762
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:55,400
to the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ecosystem so yeah</font>

763
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:58,700
people are free to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use whatever tools</font>

764
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,130
they like I actually signed in this this

765
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,779
again dates me I sign into AOL<font color="#E5E5E5"> Instant</font>

766
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:06,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">Messenger every day is one of the</font>

767
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:09,170
protocols that my my track<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane signs</font>

768
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:13,190
into of course every conversation I have

769
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:15,010
there is OTR so yeah there are there are

770
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:17,630
plain text protocols and that's fine

771
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,850
that's a business model choice but it

772
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:24,859
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay a business model choice it</font>

773
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:28,578
can't become a legal requirement yeah

774
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:30,259
discourse and legislation discuss this

775
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,989
it always comes down to the issues of

776
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:34,160
privacy and constitutional rights

777
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:36,440
economics<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that were really factored</font>

778
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,140
into it I mean when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk about you're</font>

779
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">selling products that are hampered you</font>

780
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,339
know by back doors or<font color="#E5E5E5"> we crypto you know</font>

781
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:45,140
no one's really addressing the economic

782
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:46,819
impact of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that consumers are just not</font>

783
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,589
going to body products that they know

784
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:51,140
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be subject to use dropping</font>

785
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:52,700
um so I think the economist's are

786
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,670
looking at it hard but most of that

787
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,960
intelligence is behind paywalls I think

788
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:59,569
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer that we don't have</font>

789
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:06,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">economist City efforts okay last</font>

790
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:09,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">question okay that was pretty strong</font>

791
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:18,170
incentive to use good curved over

792
00:38:09,009 --> 00:38:21,440
economic incentive where do we see the

793
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:23,180
financial incentives with crypto well so

794
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,680
we see the financial incentives with bad

795
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:31,700
crypto all the time right when when the

796
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:35,598
RSA be safe thing hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fan RSA sales</font>

797
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:38,899
plummeted when the Juniper thing hit the

798
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:42,349
finger we all know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened right</font>

799
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:46,779
we no one outside the US is going to buy

800
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:50,029
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> products if any of this comes to pass</font>

801
00:38:46,779 --> 00:38:52,630
all right um thanks if you have

802
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:52,630
additional questions

803
00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:01,170
you
