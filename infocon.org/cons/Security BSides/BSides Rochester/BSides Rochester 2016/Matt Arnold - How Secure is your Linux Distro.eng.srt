1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:09,719
okay so welcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how secure is your</font>

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:15,179
linux<font color="#CCCCCC"> distribution or if you prefer the</font>

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:22,519
Linux Mint saw bash fest of 2016 I am at

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:26,939
our old<font color="#CCCCCC"> who am i or who the heck am I um</font>

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:30,710
I'm a I've been working hacking on linux

6
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:37,010
distributions since I was about 17 or 16

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:37,010
mostly debian but slackware lately so I

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,730
do mostly instant I used to do mostly

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,710
instant messaging software and I are

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,339
seeing various communication stuff like

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:54,360
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> debian that sort</font>

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:59,699
of thing and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this is my first</font>

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:04,199
talk so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be too cruel to me um so</font>

14
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:09,110
who here uses linux mint you're probably

15
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:13,048
own already<font color="#E5E5E5"> or will be soon enough but</font>

16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:16,289
um the inspiration for this talk came

17
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,700
about in February of this year who here

18
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,810
knows what happened to linux mint in

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:26,299
febuary<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so anyone want to tell us</font>

20
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,299
what happened to linux mint in February

21
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,949
people were<font color="#CCCCCC"> corrected for two hours</font>

22
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:42,390
that's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> right they compromised the</font>

23
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,449
distribution itself the distribution

24
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,030
download servers and replaced but and

25
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,920
replace the official<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux Mint I says</font>

26
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,470
with a compromised version and by the

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">way since their distribution servers</font>

28
00:01:52,470 --> 00:02:03,930
were also their website service they

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:06,509
change the md5 sum on the website<font color="#CCCCCC"> so but</font>

30
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,110
it got me thinking what is the linux

31
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:12,360
distribution anyway well it may seem

32
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,290
obvious it's the stuff you insert into

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,180
your computer to make it go unless

34
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:25,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're on windows in which case you're</font>

35
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:27,780
in the wrong room but how a developer

36
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,760
defines a linux distribution is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

37
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">linux kernel obviously otherwise it</font>

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,730
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a freebsd distribution which</font>

39
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,610
debian does<font color="#E5E5E5"> also do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you should check it</font>

40
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:42,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">out it's quite awesome them together</font>

41
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:45,720
with a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of packages a set of software</font>

42
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,030
upstream software that makes a complete

43
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,370
operating system you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

44
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:58,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Linux kernel is the CPU of the system</font>

45
00:02:50,370 --> 00:03:02,040
that way um it's the same analogy as the

46
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,080
same CPU is in the nest on nintendo

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,250
entertainment system and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tamagotchi</font>

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,930
but they're different systems right no

49
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:15,079
one got that analogy

50
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:17,599
so depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what the distributor</font>

51
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:21,280
decides to do he can control almost

52
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:25,760
anything so the distribution is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OS</font>

53
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,129
not linux<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the kernel itself the</font>

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,980
colonel only provides drivers and other

55
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:33,798
such<font color="#CCCCCC"> mundane</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff it doesn't even build</font>

56
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:37,929
itself without a bootloader which is

57
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:40,040
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> provided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by your distribution so</font>

58
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,280
security engineering and the linux

59
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:48,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution context ken is critically</font>

60
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:51,699
important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> linux ecosys and</font>

61
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:54,949
apart from the major distributions

62
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:58,840
everyone does it badly and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

63
00:03:54,949 --> 00:04:01,189
and and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just linux mint it's</font>

64
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,120
the firmware that runs inside your

65
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:07,219
router is a linux distribution the the

66
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,379
thing that runs your TV is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the linux</font>

67
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:15,379
distribution so what this talk is going

68
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:17,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">to cover is how security engineering is</font>

69
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:19,880
done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the major linux distributions so</font>

70
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,320
that if you're like an embedded systems

71
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:29,360
designer you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can take some lessons from</font>

72
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:32,750
all right so how do so so how does how

73
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,639
do the big players define security well

74
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:40,250
while it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not written down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anywhere but</font>

75
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:41,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've patched together a definition so no</font>

76
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,020
linux distribution will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

77
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">secure all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the software all the time</font>

78
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:54,020
there are vulnerabilities in packages

79
00:04:48,860 --> 00:05:00,889
coming out daily some are more critical

80
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:03,698
than others but every day the linux

81
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:10,280
distributions or at least the big ones

82
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:12,710
deal with security problems so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font>

83
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,068
be able to secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the software all</font>

84
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:18,318
the time so

85
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:22,639
what a linux distribution or at least

86
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:25,879
the big ones Debian RedHat<font color="#CCCCCC"> etc will try</font>

87
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,949
to do is not introduce any bugs new bug

88
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:31,339
new security vulnerabilities themselves

89
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:34,520
and the parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the system they do</font>

90
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:39,529
control are as secure as we can possibly

91
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:42,369
make them usability and security are

92
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:45,949
always a trade-off so we can't go

93
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:48,139
locking down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and requiring it</font>

94
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:53,559
to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> only signed binaries or it</font>

95
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:58,270
wouldn't sell well as a distribution so

96
00:05:53,559 --> 00:06:01,099
so and the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> parties react quickly</font>

97
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:03,709
the reason I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that security</font>

98
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:06,289
vulnerabilities are being fixed daily is

99
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:12,589
because they are being actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked</font>

100
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:14,300
on daily and um security teams know

101
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:17,110
what's go what vulnerabilities are

102
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,749
coming up in the next week<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll get and</font>

103
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:23,209
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> month you can't predict</font>

104
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:29,059
vulnerabilities but as soon as one is

105
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:31,279
spotted um it gets picked it gets picked

106
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:34,849
up immediately and worked on otherwise

107
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,469
people will hit you with bats or or call

108
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:43,188
you up and swear at you in German I've

109
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:54,579
had this experience myself at two in the

110
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:57,139
morning yeah yeah but look like a joke

111
00:06:54,579 --> 00:07:02,649
how'd they even get them how they even

112
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:05,829
kept my phone number<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I can't so now</font>

113
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:09,229
now that we've dealt with definitions

114
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:11,240
let's deal with specifics there there

115
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:15,050
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple levels to securing an</font>

116
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,939
entire OS and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just responding</font>

117
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,249
to vulnerabilities and software it's

118
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:22,029
also making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't get there to</font>

119
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:22,029
begin with so

120
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,890
and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make sure voter abilities</font>

121
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:35,979
don't happen to begin with we secure the

122
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:38,539
toolchain GCC the noodles the linker in

123
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,600
recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> years with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advancement of</font>

124
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,810
static analysis technology and compilers

125
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,390
it has become<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent an</font>

126
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,060
entire Club entire classes of

127
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:54,380
vulnerabilities before they even happen

128
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:56,480
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least in most cases hackers are</font>

129
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,710
clever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> are beginning to get around</font>

130
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it but we do have least most of the</font>

131
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,940
obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> covered now I'm not a</font>

132
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,130
compiler designer so I can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

133
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:11,090
you how that all works all I know is

134
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:17,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's that that it's there it broke stuff</font>

135
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:23,419
we fixed it now integer overflow just

136
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:25,760
stack smashing all other classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

137
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:29,960
vulnerabilities don't happen or at least

138
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:35,120
are harder to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work than they used</font>

139
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:37,880
to be it used to be trivially easy to

140
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,599
exploit a unix box and this applied

141
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:45,010
everywhere freebsd anything all you had

142
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:49,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do was find a buffer overflow in I</font>

143
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:51,319
set a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> youíd binary so all you had</font>

144
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,709
to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> find a buffer overflow in ping</font>

145
00:08:51,320 --> 00:09:04,010
and you were golden now that doesn't

146
00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:06,350
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> our least it's harder so if if</font>

147
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:10,939
you want specific details<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

148
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:14,120
we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> see me after or what or what</font>

149
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:20,210
the team that's responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for these</font>

150
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are doing so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next important</font>

151
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:25,180
step to securing the Linux distribution

152
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:29,060
is securing the channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> of distribution</font>

153
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:33,170
your apt you're young you're Dan a pure

154
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,010
whatever package manager you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has</font>

155
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,069
to be

156
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:42,890
has do not install anything it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

157
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:44,840
supposed to install and that's turns out

158
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:49,220
to be harder than<font color="#CCCCCC"> it harder than it</font>

159
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:53,270
looks um because we can't use

160
00:09:49,220 --> 00:10:00,980
traditional TLS security on repositories

161
00:09:53,270 --> 00:10:02,840
anyone know why now<font color="#E5E5E5"> um because we have</font>

162
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,530
to rely on commercial CD ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

163
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:11,800
case um basically if you have one

164
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:14,300
central server you abandon and a

165
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:19,490
distributed system is<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more secure</font>

166
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:24,500
than a centralized system every day of

167
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:29,150
the week so what the major distributions

168
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:33,260
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted is they sign their</font>

169
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:38,060
repository index files with<font color="#E5E5E5"> gpg now what</font>

170
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:42,189
a repository index file is is it lists

171
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:44,949
every binary package every<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpm every Deb</font>

172
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:51,700
that's available in that repository

173
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:57,830
together with its secure hash sha-1 md5

174
00:10:51,700 --> 00:11:01,190
whatever it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really doesn't matter so</font>

175
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:04,990
after apt is done downloading the first

176
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:08,330
thing it does is check the md5 or

177
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:11,600
whatever hasher using and you should be

178
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:14,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">using cha 256 unless you've royally</font>

179
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:20,030
broke in your apt configuration which is

180
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,160
very hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do these days so the first</font>

181
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:27,530
thing it will do is check against its

182
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:32,660
database of hashes and it won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> install</font>

183
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:35,360
anything us the hash matches but anyone

184
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:38,360
want to know what can be the difference

185
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,240
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> a boner a piece of software with</font>

186
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,300
a remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> hole and a piece of software</font>

187
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:51,150
without a removal

188
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:54,000
one bit one bit in a binary um can often

189
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:57,090
mean the difference between a vulnerable

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:06,330
piece of software and are not an ounce

191
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:09,740
of software so so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use PGP</font>

192
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:14,160
to make sure that no man in the middle

193
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:18,750
attack happens because it's trivially

194
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,180
easy to change the md5 or the package

195
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:27,060
the signature of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the specific package</font>

196
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:30,060
you're working on and um then flip the

197
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:37,949
bit in the binary if you're using TLS Oh

198
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:40,739
up or so pgp is used to sign the index

199
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:44,750
files and that's secured and that

200
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:52,740
secures the channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> of distribution in</font>

201
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:55,350
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases um we are come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ftp master</font>

202
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,130
team of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Debian and there are similar</font>

203
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:01,290
teams in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Red Hat are constantly are</font>

204
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:03,990
constantly doing research on as to how

205
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:08,280
to break it so they discover

206
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:13,700
vulnerabilities before the hackers in

207
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:23,850
this particular piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of infrastructure</font>

208
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:25,290
so what what so basically two attacks

209
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,480
that have been prevented<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they</font>

210
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:34,620
were ever able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen in the wild</font>

211
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:37,140
where the replay attack where you replay

212
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,650
a known unknown vulnerable version of

213
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:42,080
the software as if its current there was

214
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:49,430
no way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to detect</font>

215
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:54,020
2010 now there is it's called valid

216
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:59,900
until it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it simply date stamps the</font>

217
00:13:54,020 --> 00:14:02,689
release files and the other attack was

218
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,150
not so much an attack but a design flaw

219
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:10,070
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps and I only know specifically</font>

220
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:13,670
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Debian um so the design flaw an</font>

221
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:17,840
app that was discovered<font color="#E5E5E5"> was um basically</font>

222
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:20,479
any key that was registered in apt as a

223
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:24,590
valid signing key would be accepted for

224
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:28,580
all repositories there was no way to

225
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:33,860
detect what repository went with what

226
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:36,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">keys and new versions of Debian Jesse</font>

227
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:43,430
onwards it's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer possible to do</font>

228
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:51,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> repos security for you</font>

229
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:53,719
and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> being terribly boring but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once a</font>

230
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,410
repo is compromised the way the Linux

231
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:03,920
Mint one was how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the cycle time</font>

232
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:07,790
until<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gets reset by the correct teams</font>

233
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:11,149
no longer be distributing well lytic

234
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:14,810
Smith was a media was a compromise of

235
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:18,320
their ISO media not the repository

236
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:20,449
itself now if you compromise a

237
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,870
repository say you break into a

238
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:27,370
repository sir if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to the</font>

239
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,990
repo server<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's trivially easy and</font>

240
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:34,399
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be undetectable if you compromise</font>

241
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:37,339
the repo because the way automatic

242
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,639
signing works on repo servers is you

243
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:44,870
have to have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> passphrase to the gpg</font>

244
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:49,660
key in memory every time you do a update

245
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:53,269
of the repo which no one wants to do

246
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:58,550
everyone wants to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> their changes in</font>

247
00:15:53,269 --> 00:16:00,320
fast and make it works and no<font color="#E5E5E5"> one no one</font>

248
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,420
wants to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy that's standing by</font>

249
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:08,860
to enter the passphrase 24 hours a day

250
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:14,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven days a week so um what they do</font>

251
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:18,199
what most repos do is have a key that is

252
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:20,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">not password protected at all so once</font>

253
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:23,300
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that repo server you own the</font>

254
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:26,750
whole distribution and there are two

255
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:29,180
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of preventing that and both are</font>

256
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:33,850
usually employed by good distributions

257
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:36,019
one is to make the repo server as

258
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:42,320
difficult to hack as you possibly can

259
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:46,670
make it which um back when I ran a repo

260
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,870
I'm made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had to have PGP</font>

261
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:52,790
encrypted port knocking on it so the

262
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,730
firewall wouldn't even let you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font>

263
00:16:52,790 --> 00:17:01,339
you or me or have access to my gpg key

264
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:06,679
in any event and the second way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

265
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:11,120
that to secure against a repo compromise

266
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,559
is to have the anyway everyone knows how

267
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,628
PGP works

268
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:20,240
and will understand what i mean by

269
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:22,730
revocation certificate so basically what

270
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,849
debian and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think Fedora does this as</font>

271
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:28,669
well is have their revocation

272
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:31,279
certificate and they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it through a</font>

273
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:34,600
secret sharing scheme and give the

274
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:39,970
secrets to geographically distributed

275
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:45,678
persons that are trust so basically

276
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:49,519
there are 12 people who debian who sort

277
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:53,450
of watch for a repo compromise and if it

278
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:57,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens they get together and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 mm and</font>

279
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,980
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven of them agree that the repo has</font>

280
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:04,119
been compromised they're allowed to

281
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:09,999
revoke any key that<font color="#CCCCCC"> debian has ever used</font>

282
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:15,490
so once that happens actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> staff work</font>

283
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:25,999
and that the time the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it takes</font>

284
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:29,269
varies um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know I don't know</font>

285
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:33,740
who's currently on staff to do that in

286
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:35,809
debian but if the people responsible for

287
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that we're anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

288
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:40,580
people responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for checking out</font>

289
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:44,389
security vulnerabilities back when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

290
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:48,220
in actively involved it would be

291
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:50,719
measured in you<font color="#E5E5E5"> 48 hours at the latest</font>

292
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:56,299
before you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> German people cursing at</font>

293
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:59,590
you into him and then if that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

294
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:59,590
work they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> French people cursing</font>

295
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:09,710
and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Swedes get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

296
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:15,270
fun day when you have a major problem

297
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:17,730
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not taking care of it now</font>

298
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,530
linux mint as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know doesn't have</font>

299
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:24,030
any of these security procedures set up

300
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:26,430
so what amazes most people would know

301
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything about linux distribution</font>

302
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:31,350
security engineering is not that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux</font>

303
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:37,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">mint hack happened it's that it didn't</font>

304
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:40,770
happen sooner and you can see thee and

305
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,350
you can look at the lwn comment sections

306
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:47,720
and mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the reaction</font>

307
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:50,820
from the community as this happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

308
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought i bet they didn't have Clem's</font>

309
00:19:50,820 --> 00:20:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone number they would be cursing at</font>

310
00:19:52,470 --> 00:20:02,810
him so the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of security</font>

311
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:06,360
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> in linux distributions is</font>

312
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:09,690
called patch management or change

313
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:13,020
management see all the repo security in

314
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:17,040
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no good if you don't</font>

315
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:23,360
tightly control who has access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

316
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:31,260
the repo at any<font color="#E5E5E5"> given time um and and</font>

317
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:33,990
it's um and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the idea is any change in</font>

318
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:40,770
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution you all know who did it</font>

319
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:44,880
when and hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> why so you want a</font>

320
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:48,180
public<font color="#E5E5E5"> record as possible and on you</font>

321
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:53,660
Bunty you can install<font color="#E5E5E5"> Debian dash key</font>

322
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:56,610
ring and run a command to get a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

323
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,650
the thousand or so people who have

324
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,770
direct commit access to the repo and

325
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:08,180
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> email addresses</font>

326
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:11,639
so as an active distribution contributor

327
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:14,430
you get a lot of spam emails I get like

328
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:21,320
five thousand a day and I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

329
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:25,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">involved in about a year so um because</font>

330
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:27,840
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> without direct access the person</font>

331
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:32,040
with direct access better know who made

332
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:39,240
that change when and why otherwise they

333
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:42,750
won't have access for very um and and at

334
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:45,750
least the Debian people and slackware

335
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:48,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">two are very serious about who gets</font>

336
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:52,200
access to what you have to go through a

337
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:54,990
whole identity validation process where

338
00:21:52,200 --> 00:22:00,150
you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City show them your</font>

339

340
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:08,340
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> test it's like the worst final you've</font>

341
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:11,790
ever had and it's individually and

342
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,679
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been and when you go to apply</font>

343
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,950
for commit access they've been watching

344
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:20,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">you for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> typically a year or more I don't</font>

345
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:23,550
want to face my own committers exam yet

346
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,520
because they know exactly where I'm

347
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:32,700
likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mess up and they will ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

348
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:37,860
those questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Fedora is</font>

349
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:40,020
similar they have not pgp validating

350
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:43,409
their committers they have ssl

351
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:47,520
certificates<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 infrastructure which</font>

352
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:52,290
is a bit easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Red Hat Inc to</font>

353
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:55,530
managed centrally um

354
00:22:52,290 --> 00:23:00,149
and that's a bit of security flaw there

355
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:01,620
but um or could be potentially but as

356
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,020
long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're maintaining their</font>

357
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,949
correct procedures they are gapping

00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:11,639
their central signing server that

359
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:13,860
shootin that's not much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a problem but</font>

360
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:19,140
as I said in security decentralized

361
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:27,050
systems beat centralized systems any day

362
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:27,050
of the week hang on that better not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

363
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:34,800
wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be surprised if someone from</font>

364
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:38,790
the community was watching this would

365
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,790
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be surprised in the least um now the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">next aspect I don't have a slide for</font>

367
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:49,560
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's kind of freeform and</font>

there's no set process<font color="#E5E5E5"> because every</font>

security incident is different is what

370
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:57,800
happens when you discover or it is

371
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,899
discovered that a security vulnerability

372

exists in some part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the system and</font>

373
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:09,840
likes a bash or we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> shellshock</font>

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerability a couple of your Telugu so</font>

375
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:19,590
what happens when vulnerability like

376
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:24,120
that is discovered well you all know

377
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:27,030
what CVEs are right<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're basically</font>

378
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,070
public reports of security

379
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:33,020
vulnerabilities that exists in a piece

380
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:33,020
of software um and

381
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:45,180
debian has what is called the security

382
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:48,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident tracker basically its data</font>

383
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:51,990
mining and Fedora has a similar thing

384
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:54,290
but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it i don't i don't</font>

385
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,670
know enough about their procedures to

386
00:24:54,290 --> 00:25:01,170
tell you what it's called or how it

387
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:06,720
works or anything so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

388
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:08,970
data mining the cds for any penny bug

389
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:14,250
that applies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a package in the</font>

390
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:16,530
distribution and when something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

391
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:19,500
that is discovered you get a friendly

392
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">email and if you don't respond to the</font>

393
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:25,230
friendly email saying you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

security<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem in your package or one</font>

395
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:32,790
of your teammates<font color="#E5E5E5"> does one for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

396
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:37,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">you typically get an annoyed email from</font>

397
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:41,430
a human and if you don't respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

398
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:43,260
they attempt to find other contact

399
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:45,150
information other than your public email

400
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:50,490
address and that's at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where</font>

401
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:54,780
you get German people calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you at two</font>

402
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:57,930
in the morning came and basically they

403
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:04,340
say you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem fix it or it's</font>

404
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:04,340
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for you um and</font>

405
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:15,629
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's a publicly reported</font>

406
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:18,649
vulnerability it'll get uploaded as soon

407
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:24,419
as it's done and it better be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done fast</font>

408
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:29,908
like a week is is the furthest it's

409
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:31,679
acceptable to be at<font color="#E5E5E5"> for responding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

410
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:35,580
security vulnerability before you get

411
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:38,100
annoyed calls and eventually your access

412
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:41,129
to commit on that package is revoked and

413
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,760
the security team takes over and it's a

414
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:50,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">very bad day for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your reputation anyway</font>

415
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">um but it is it's a private</font>

416
00:26:50,760 --> 00:27:02,158
vulnerability things work a little bit

417
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:05,189
different um because private

418
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,210
vulnerabilities are private so the

419
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:13,590
reporter of the vulnerability or

420
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:17,070
whatever organization responsible for

421
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:20,610
assigning the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE will typically reach</font>

422
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:25,649
out to the major distributions and the

423
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:27,510
week and if it's bad enough the major

424
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:33,629
distributions will reach out to the

425
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:36,590
minor distributions and so typically the

426
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:39,960
process works such that the patch is

427
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:42,209
already in and fixed as soon as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

428
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,889
public so as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the vulnerability</font>

429
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:48,690
goes public you of a patch in the

430
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:51,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">already built ready to update ready to</font>

431
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:57,090
go now<font color="#CCCCCC"> for zero-day vulnerabilities</font>

432
00:27:51,529 --> 00:28:00,210
slightly different um because your

433
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:02,039
native owner<font color="#CCCCCC"> bodis will get it depending</font>

434
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,500
on how serious it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get the</font>

00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:08,490
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> team involved they're involved</font>

436
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:11,399

um<font color="#CCCCCC"> my first talk and I look dead</font>

comparable so so that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE response</font>

447
00:28:45,309 --> 00:29:01,570
works and um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> involved in</font>

448
00:28:53,940 --> 00:29:08,950
about a year in debian work but hang on

449
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:14,049
now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll stay there sorry um but um</font>

450
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:16,780
I almost got another annoyed German

451
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:19,450
phone call if my team mate hadn't been

452
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:22,780
able to take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

453
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,549
because the vulnerability in a package I

454
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,250
was responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for was spotted last</font>

455
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:30,900
week and I didn't know about it and I

456
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:36,309
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be asked when I can go back in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> May</font>

457
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:38,590
end of end of May to contribute to

458
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:44,080
Debian where was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Island the security</font>

459
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:47,918
vulnerability happened and um so

460
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:51,460
security is taken very seriously in most

461
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,990
major distributions like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said in the</font>

462
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:58,900
minor distributions in the router

463
00:29:52,990 --> 00:30:00,700
firmware it's not at all with linux mint

464
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,530
and a bunch of the smaller distributions

465
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,409
they typically only have one server on

466
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:08,710
which they put their website and there

467
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:11,710
is 0 distribution and their build system

468
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:15,039
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything so compromising that one</font>

whatever is the keys to the kingdom now

471
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:26,429
linux mint was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky and this is</font>

they smartened up

476
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:40,090
they look a lot like the linesman's case

477
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:44,139
study would but<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux mint is the only</font>

00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:55,960

00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:57,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was basically how is basically the</font>

malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of the distribution</font>

484
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:08,040
they inserted a package on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I so</font>

485
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:11,560
they slipped streamed it onto the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISO</font>

486
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:14,230
which is very easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

487
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:17,050
iso building tools right on the system

488
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:20,140
there and we're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point in the top</font>

489
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:24,070
where I expect questions so just stop me

490
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:28,450
there um so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> slip streamed a piece</font>

491
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:34,270
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux now are called tsunami um which</font>

492
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:37,120
is basically a standard bonnet such as

493
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,730
you'd get on a drive-by download for

494
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,770
windows or apple but because they had

495
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,470
control of the build servers they could

496
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:47,139
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> it specifically for their target</font>

malware for<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux works all</font>

499
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:55,120
distributions all the time um because

500
00:31:52,300 --> 00:32:00,370
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so heterogeneous and that's part of</font>

501
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:04,570
what makes Linux more secure than any

502
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:08,189
other platform out there um or freebsd

503
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:13,389
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to boast of more secure</font>

504
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:15,600
open open DSD they only get a better

505
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:19,060
security record because they're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane</font>

506
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,689
because they're paranoid and no one uses

507
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:30,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">them mexican</font>

508
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:33,500
um that's exactly but so inserted this

509
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:38,060
malware onto the disk I'll replace the

510
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:42,410
md5 sum on the website and bang they

511
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:45,320
were in business now because linux users

512
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:48,940
are smart and that's the that's the up

513
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:51,560
or most<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux users are somewhat smart</font>

514
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:55,490
that's the other security that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

515
00:32:51,560 --> 00:33:01,370
other a bit of security in this puzzle

516
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:04,730
it's you and I it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the enthusiasts</font>

517
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:07,189
solving Linux users out there who

518
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:11,660
noticed this stuff who are paying

519
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:14,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention this was spotted within hours</font>

520
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:17,570
and they shut down the download server

521
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:28,040
and got everything all squared away

522
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:30,830
eventually but and but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only reason</font>

523
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,200
this wasn't as bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it could be was</font>

524
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:37,399
and the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason this was able to be</font>

525
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,340
noticed was the guy who<font color="#CCCCCC"> did it I went</font>

526
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:43,450
and bragged to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ZDNet and made his</font>

527
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:47,030
malware obvious nap now if you were

528
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:50,120
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really malicious you could</font>

529
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:54,230
do a bit flip in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl package and</font>

530
00:33:50,120 --> 00:34:00,320
make it vulnerable or or insert a

00:33:54,230 --> 00:34:06,860
rootkit into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ext4 or or XFS drivers</font>

532
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:10,159
and then not brag about it um but you

533
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,980
would still get noticed so this probably

534
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,319
has it

535
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:19,050
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> first like major</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other smaller</font>

536
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:21,889

537
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:27,570
they maintain their security practices

538
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:44,580
correctly um um it shouldn't be a

539
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:47,970
problem mint has a lot of users but is

540
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:50,279
only managed by three developers who are

541
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:52,109
very good at graphical design and making

542
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,440
things look pretty they're amazing at

543
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:58,819
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I installed the mint user interface</font>

544
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,580
on top of slacker that's how good<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

545
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:04,590
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other distributions</font>

546
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:09,060
pull their software and are installing

547
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:10,710
it on their own systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> but because they</font>

548
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,930
don't care about low level engineering

549
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:19,320
and because they're a poorly funded team

550
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:20,940
on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and don't really understand the</font>

551
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:26,369
security implications of what they're

552
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:30,390
doing I mean we have some of the Debian

553
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:31,770
RedHat and the other big players in the

554
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,900
distribution market have some of the

555
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:44,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">most talented security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> researchers in</font>

556
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:47,900
the in the world working for um so if

557
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:53,759
you're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a distribution if you're</font>

558
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:55,800
doing embedded device work if you're

559
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,470
doing anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

560
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:05,100

561
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:08,029
mistakes um and um take it stand on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

562
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:12,330
shoulders of giants in essence um

563
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:14,220
because Debian fedora and everybody else

564
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:20,970
have already done<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this security</font>

565
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">work for you and it only and and so it</font>

566
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:28,109
doesn't take a lot to re-implement

567
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:32,340
or use what other the bigger

568
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:35,130
distributions are using so but linux

569
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:39,240
mint doesn't didn't really care about

570
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:43,470
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> at about correct low level</font>

571
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:51,169
engineering before they had I bet

572
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:54,509
they're carrying a lot now um but um so

573
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:56,790
don't put the iso on the same server as

574
00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:03,170
the website don't put your build system

575
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:06,770

00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:29,400
are some CGI scripts um but the fool but

583
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,040
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Debian user forums which are run by</font>

584
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,980
Debian are on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely separate</font>

585
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,759
server on a completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> separate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> June in</font>

586
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:41,160
a completely separate geographical area

587
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,860
on a completely separate subnet of the

588
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:48,060
VPN apparently I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

589
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:49,950
sure but the fourth but the when when

590
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:54,390
the Debian user forums were hacked a few

591
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:58,230
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was 2011 someone</font>

592
00:37:54,390 --> 00:38:03,029
nothing happened other than the forums

593
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:06,650
were hacked in that sucked um but it had

594
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:11,100
no distribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> wide consequences now if</font>

595
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:14,930
the if a server like the Debian master

596
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:20,339
server were hacked or rise or Alioth

597
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:23,069
which are the central infrastructure of

598
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:26,880
the project is managed by those three

599
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:29,280
servers so if those three servers get

600
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,890
hacked it's not going to be a good day

601
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,730
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2005 when</font>

602
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:37,759
they got hacked or one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them did</font>

603
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:44,420
I forget I forget exactly which one but

604
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:49,910
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really matter but and it's</font>

605
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:52,250
very hard to hack those servers so um I

606
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:55,399
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> off on a tangent there but back to</font>

607
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:58,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the original question linux mint is</font>

608
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,430
small in terms of development team size

609
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:04,790
to what they're trying to accomplish um

610
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:09,500
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what matters I mean they</font>

611
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:14,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">could easily like um not distribute</font>

612
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">iso's and just rely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on you bunt to IFOS</font>

613
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:21,140
and a little script to get their stuff

614
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,840
working but they don't do that they want

615
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:27,700
to distribute the ISO themselves and

616
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:29,960
that that has security consequences so

617
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,689
anyone have any more questions because

618
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:45,020
I'm running out of material and I still

619
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:53,320
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes whoo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off topic</font>

620
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:53,320
I'm I'm the<font color="#CCCCCC"> king of tangents so yep</font>

621
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:15,109
however have you ever um do you program

622
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:16,819
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ever done a greater than sign</font>

625
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:30,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is at least for x86 the</font>

626
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:33,890
opcode the machine instruction that

627
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,719
essentially controls what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font>

00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:39,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">is doing for greater than or less than</font>

630
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:45,219
that is in your secure in your program

631
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:49,729
you could easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a remote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hole if</font>

632
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:56,509
and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other up codes which are</font>

one bit apart or or or or inserting an

634
00:40:56,509 --> 00:41:03,259
extra bite and it would still work<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

635
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:08,380
it would cause a remote hole all depends

636
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:13,099
on knowing the software itself and

637
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:16,839
knowing how how<font color="#CCCCCC"> its assembled everything</font>

638
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:21,140
but you can manipulate it there was

639
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:22,910
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> classic case and this was</font>

640
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:28,699
discussed at the Chaos Computer Club

641
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:31,629
meeting of 2014 I can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the exact</font>

642
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:35,179
talk title if you want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusively</font>

643
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:39,829
demonstrated that you could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

644
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:44,179
remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> hole by flipping one bit so</font>

645
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:47,269
binary manipulation is a thing now there

646
00:41:44,179 --> 00:41:52,989
are no recorded cases of it happening in

647
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:55,788
the wild but who knows like North Korea

648
00:41:52,989 --> 00:42:00,610
distributes a linux<font color="#CCCCCC"> distribution who</font>

649
00:41:55,789 --> 00:42:05,020
knows what they're doing with it um

650
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:07,330
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> China has this great firewall that</font>

651
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:11,290
can do deep packet inspection and

652
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:14,740
whatever so who<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows what they're doing</font>

653
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:19,990
with that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily get an</font>

654
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:21,939
encryption back door if you had to build

655
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:23,709
on what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier talked about if you</font>

656
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:27,040
are at the keynote you could you don't

657
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:31,180
even have to legislate it you can if you

658
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:34,480
control the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet the pipes you can</font>

659
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:39,960
theoretically control everything so does

660
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,960
that answer your question over there and

661
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:57,299
um you install Debian and um look up

662
00:42:53,110 --> 00:43:00,880
mate on debian or cinnamon on debian or

663
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:07,260
you or slackware has even better support

664
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:11,440
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this um you can essentially download</font>

665
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:15,580
cinnamon or mate like if we can get out

666
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:21,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this I'm i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iterative i'm</font>

667
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:25,420
using mates on um yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and their</font>

668
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:29,140
cinnamon spins um that are attached to

669
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:32,140
larger distributions you bunt to mate

670
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:34,540
remix is a good one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I believe</font>

671
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:39,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's one for cinnamon coming out as</font>

672
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:39,090
well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know if that's out yet but</font>

673
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:47,710
basically the software that's a user

674
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:50,049
interface is disconnected from the

675
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:52,780
distribution so you can essentially do

676
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:57,820
it on any distribution distribution if

677
00:43:52,780 --> 00:44:03,550
you know how and the distro overlords

678
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:06,280
being the good good people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font>

679
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:09,520
have provided ways to do that on a more

680
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:13,700
secure distribution so debian<font color="#E5E5E5"> fedora</font>

681
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:16,279
anyone will have this sort of capability

682
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:18,960
you just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look for it and not</font>

683
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:26,059
reflexively download mint because it's

684
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:26,059
easy um and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't mean to rag on mint</font>

685
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:34,589
actually I do because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> um well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it may</font>

686
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,720
seem like i'm picking on them but it

687
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:39,900
could have easily this could easily

688
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:43,799
apply to any small distribution like

689
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:48,269
solid xk or app to sador apostate or

690
00:44:43,799 --> 00:44:50,430
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's called um this could even</font>

691
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:52,709
apply to slackware if the security if

692
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:56,328
the people running it weren't smart and

693
00:44:52,710 --> 00:45:00,299
paying attention and everything so

694
00:44:56,329 --> 00:45:07,980
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

695
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:10,670
think and basically i'll answer

696
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:15,380
questions until they kick me out um

697
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:15,380
there you

698
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:33,150
anyone you could compromise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I applied</font>

699
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,830
this to the major distributions but it

700
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:39,450
could easily apply to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> firmware in</font>

701
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:42,810
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV everyone's using Linux now um so</font>

702
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:45,870
um it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could easily apply to your phone</font>

703
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:52,820
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could easily apply to anything that</font>

704
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:56,279
runs linux um who would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it um</font>

705
00:45:52,820 --> 00:46:02,720
generally anyone with an interest in

706
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:11,870
hacking those things for any purpose um

707
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:15,779
um yeah monitoring um um there could be

708
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:19,380
trade secret implications like a lot of

709
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:24,020
development companies use linux as part

710
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:27,930
of their development work<font color="#E5E5E5"> like um so</font>

711
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:30,800
trade secret theft just sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of anything</font>

712
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:34,649
you would want to hack anybody over a

713
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:38,460
distribution is a way as with any other

714
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:45,150
operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> system so does that answer</font>

715
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:50,310
your question do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still have time yes</font>

716
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:53,130
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> any anyone have any more questions so</font>

717
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:55,790
you guys start your own again<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and be</font>

718
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,790
like man um

719
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:04,920
and now no I'm probably going to do a

720
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:07,250
proof of concept distribution that just

721
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:18,930
some weird things<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the colonel but</font>

722
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:20,220
that'll stay in the lab for down um so

723
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:25,730
does anyone have any more questions

724
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:25,730
there can i I over there

securing that image so<font color="#E5E5E5"> theoretically a</font>

hacker who is inside amazon or inside

729
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:51,910
digital ocean or any sort of cloud

730
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:55,330
provider could slip stream a piece of

00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:58,000
malware a rootkit or whatever inside

attack also<font color="#E5E5E5"> works so those images better</font>

00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:21,750
be secure um so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still have time or</font>

00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:34,470
running out of material 10 min for
