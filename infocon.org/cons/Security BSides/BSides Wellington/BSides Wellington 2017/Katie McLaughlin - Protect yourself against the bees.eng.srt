flowers lots of flowers lots of bees

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:57,120
even fuzzy ones from Wellington this was

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,370
taken the the windmills up the way but I

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,289
like these kind of ease but I also like

22
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:06,719
these kind of ease this is a bee this is

23
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,100
an emoji be my slides up and I'll

24
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,100
updating over here one moment

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:24,270
there you go okay stop that right this

26
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,619
is an emoji B emoji you may be familiar

27
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,798
with it

28
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,840
poet Ahana is the Maori word for cure a

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,789
by the way my slides didn't have the

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,490
translations up here sorry um

31
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:36,959
anyway this is Abby you may recognize it

32
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,399
you may not recognize it because

33
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,729
depending on what platform you're using

34
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,829
your emoji bees look different if you're

35
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,450
on iOS it'll buy the first one if you're

36
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,068
an Android in the middle and if you're

37
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,099
on Windows it'll look like the one on

38
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:53,250
the end it all depends what platform

39
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:55,079
you're running now a lot of the bees are

40
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,000
standardized which is great

41
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,529
standard bees for everyone they all look

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,509
the same they've all got two wings

43
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,899
sometimes they have legs have a stinger

44
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,840
it's great then it gets a bit confusing

45
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:10,038
so you've got the iOS beep standard be

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,840
yeah bit of a cartoon yeah 7 out of 10

47
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:15,149
then you've got this bee which is just

48
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,880
cute as heck this is from emoji 1 which

49
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,940
is a kick-started open source open

50
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,690
licensed emoji said but they keep on

51
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,690
updating their B so depending on which

52
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:31,980
version you have you have a different B

53
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:34,290
I like 2.0 it's kind of fuzzy this is

54
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,880
the Android B this is my favorite be 10

55
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,269
out of 10 keep buzzing my little friend

56
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:46,769
um sadly this B has been superseded by

57
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:49,109
this B this is the Android Oreo B it's

58
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:53,209
an exorcist because I've never seen any

59
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:53,209
B with the eyes and the wings

60
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,989
good luck getting that one out of your

61
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:03,230
head um this is the LGB if you have an

62
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:06,350
LG phone they supersede your emoji for

63
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,700
you this be it's like the B movie but

64
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,620
every time you see the B you keep on

65
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,720
being reminded that the B movie exists

66
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,550
and this is from Samsung so every time

67
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,900
you see this B you need to make sure

68
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,860
you're not using a Galaxy Note because

69
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,900
they explode and of course you have your

70
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:25,040
wonderful successful red team abhi with

71
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,850
its honeypot he's playing Quidditch I

72
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,739
don't know anyway

73
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,780
I'm for these and more emoji takes

74
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,490
follow me on Twitter TOCOM slash emoji

75
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,610
right it's like dog rates but for emoji

76
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:37,370
anyway back to the beasts when I'm not

77
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:40,370
taking pictures or grading B's

78
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,290
I do conference Docs I've been traveling

79
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,510
around just a little bit doing a talk

80
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,060
called the power and responsibilities of

81
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:49,160
Unicode adoption which sounds completely

82
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,930
super technical but it's basically just

83
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,090
me ranting about emoji and not just the

84
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,540
B emoji it's great you should go see it

85
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,650
ah thing is that's not my top title this

86
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,060
is my top title the power bolt and

87
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,090
responsibility it's called sweat of

88
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,040
Unicode adoption its buckles which makes

89
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,870
it really fun when you try to put this

90
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,299
as your talk title through every kind of

91
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,800
conference software you can imagine

92
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,200
first time I got accepted I got an

93
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,410
acceptance email congratulations we have

94
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,920
chosen your talk select a talk the power

95
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,200
lightning bolt and responsibility

96
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,550
where's the rest of my talk title

97
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,469
doesn't sup there some places won't even

98
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,780
let me submit it because it says that oh

99
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,360
we can't handle full byte characters so

100
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,250
we're just gonna like drop your talk

101
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,370
content so I can't even like put my

102
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:40,600
proper talk title up but then the lovely

103
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,600
crew at Kiwi Con

104
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,700
yeah sadly it didn't get accepted last

105
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,310
year Kiwi Kong could've got accepted

106
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:58,550
here besides Wellington accepting what

107
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:59,740
he tweaked on rejects it's what makes it

108
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,300
the best

109
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,700
sorry that's a tuna pun I should keep to

110
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,800
the beat punks anyway um some

111
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,659
conferences get it right I get in line

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,190
emoji and it works fine except when they

113
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,030
try to print it out and then it just

114
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:15,890
drops or sometimes when you have say the

115
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,710
lovely AV people that get printouts um

116
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,330
it prints out that and for this

117
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,789
particular talk I was introduced on

118
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,460
stage as the power box box and

119
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:29,390
responsibility box of Unicode adoption

120
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:32,599
box that was fun but some wonderful

121
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:35,090
conferences actually add a B for me

122
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,100
because my talk title was supposed to be

123
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:41,840
protect yourself from the beat the emoji

124
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:43,640
get to the sides thank you um the amount

125
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,039
of effort that B sides put in to

126
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,510
actually put a B there was great because

127
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,280
it's like oh I'm doing the talk about

128
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,810
the B it's about as a be on your

129
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,719
schedule here's some I prepared earlier

130
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,880
um other times it just works as well

131
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,940
like I've had wonderful in line thinking

132
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,430
emerging in my talk but this particular

133
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,920
character wasn't standardized until 2016

134
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,870
so I've had printouts in communications

135
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,030
that look like that we're just being fun

136
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,820
but mostly they just tend to drop it out

137
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,299
entirely this was a print out put on a

138
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,549
wall so I put emoji stickers on it and

139
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,959
fixed it

140
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:21,378
but what's really great is when you get

141
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:22,699
the digital bullets cuz this is how my

142
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:24,529
talk came up

143
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:29,659
you may notice something a bit weird

144
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:33,439
that that is a legitimate that is the

145
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:36,859
Windows 8.0 representation of that emoji

146
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,269
which means I know that at the mumble

147
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:40,128
mumble Convention Center in mumble

148
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:42,139
mumble City I know that they're running

149
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:43,939
Windows eight point I and have not

150
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:46,129
upgraded to eight point one so you know

151
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:47,719
exactly what operating system they're

152
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:52,039
running and then you can get your mad

153
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:53,748
zero days from there so that's fun and I

154
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,039
don't just do this like I don't just

155
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:56,479
travel the world giving talks about

156
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,669
emoji just to try to pop conference

157
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,929
software I can just tweet people that

158
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:04,698
decide to leave their internet on in the

159
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:06,619
middle there talk pop ups hi from this

160
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:10,369
we can tell that this wonderful person

161
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:11,839
is running Windows 10 but you know

162
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:13,009
there's still like the actual thing you

163
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,419
there you can tell it's Windows but

164
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:19,039
because of the color you can tell it's

165
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:20,389
Windows 10 and it's not just conference

166
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,329
slides I also do it when I order coffee

167
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:25,249
there's a little tiny be there and when

168
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:29,029
I'm not ordering coffee I just order the

169
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:30,649
food that looks like emoji anyway this

170
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:32,449
is delicious by the way this is from

171
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:36,319
sweet release friends of Kiwi con and

172
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:40,099
besides it's amazing but if you can't

173
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,939
find emoji fake vegan pork dumplings you

174
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:42,938
can always just get a bee-sting

175
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:48,828
anyway back to the beasts so this is a

176
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:50,179
hacker conf yeah we know bees are

177
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:53,179
awesome but going use bees to hack

178
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:54,828
things well if you have a whole lot of

179
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:56,479
time and some super glue and little tiny

180
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:57,979
micro processors you could attach the

181
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,469
little tiny microprocessor to the back

182
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,998
of bees like they did in Manchester so

183
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:03,498
they have these little tiny microchips

184
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:04,969
on the back of these and they can track

185
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:06,529
where they go and see the migrating

186
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,279
patterns of bees and work out why all

187
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,719
the bees are disappearing

188
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,189
maybe it's because people keep on

189
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:13,699
attaching microchips to them and they

190
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:17,799
get really upset but this is fiddly um

191
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,799
also known as the Internet of sting spy

192
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:25,020
we should stick to our emoji but what is

193
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:27,449
emerging emoji is used to describe any

194
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,508
sort of picture character but it's not

195
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:32,940
emoji is a specific thing these are not

196
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,440
emoji these are terrible terrible things

197
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,120
that should not exist they're normally

198
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,399
animated and they make me cry when I

199
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,289
hear these are called emoji these are

200
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,219
also not emoji these are Facebook

201
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:50,730
stickers I have 20 minutes

202
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:51,750
thank you I know these are not emoji

203
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,339
these were cool back when yahoo

204
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,420
messenger was the thing 15 years ago

205
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,950
when you could get the original Shrek

206
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,449
stickers in your messenger and annoy

207
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,510
people because Ben width is horrible

208
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:05,940
this is not an emoji this is an an emoji

209
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,680
this is facial recognition tracking as a

210
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,269
gimmick trying to make it popular and

211
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,399
also trying to get you to buy the iPhone

212
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:13,740
X or 10 or whatever they want to call it

213
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,560
now this is a perversion of the stuff

214
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,839
that sort of takes away your privacy but

215
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,880
you know cute anthropomorphic Fox and

216
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,070
these are not emoji either these are

217
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,700
stickers you can use these stickers in

218
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,850
Twitter

219
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,829
these these are emoji duck is an

220
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,510
official emoji owl as an official emoji

221
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:32,760
however the implementation here is

222
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,760
putting stickers on two emoji which

223
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,230
means that you can do things like

224
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,140
anonymize particular screenshots in your

225
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,550
presentation except do not do this to

226
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,199
anonymize your information with twitter

227
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,810
stickers because the original image will

228
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,020
be uploaded to Twitter please don't do

229
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,010
this

230
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:52,800
anyway native emoji can also break your

231
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:58,410
phone which is great this is the pride

232
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:01,529
flag this is a legit emoji unicode can

233
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,449
calm being clumpy bump Gandhi bump it is

234
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:05,279
comprised of two existing emoji

235
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:07,109
characters and then a 0 with Joyner in

236
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,640
the middle so when it reads it all

237
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,589
together in a system that's been

238
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,310
specifically updated to understand this

239
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:17,070
set it will change into the pride flag

240
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:20,069
except if you were to say put white flag

241
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:23,579
0 rainbow you could crash your phone

242
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:26,040
they've since fixed this there's been a

243
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:28,969
whole lot of Unicode bugs in iPhone

244
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:40,889
including the effective

245
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:42,929
that wasn't me that's a bug anyway the

246
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:45,209
the effective power thing

247
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:47,160
has a whole bunch of Arabic text and

248
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,899
when it pops up in a notification the

249
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,819
notifications automatically truncated

250
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,410
except if you're familiar with our big

251
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:53,969
text the more you add the shorter it

252
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,469
gets so it tries to truncate it it goes

253
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,529
to longer tries to truncate again and

254
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:00,480
the phone reboots there's also this

255
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:03,509
really interesting bug where you tried

256
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,759
to type and it came up as that that's

257
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:09,600
fun on the web it's even greater you

258
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:14,459
know where emoji has to work URLs it has

259
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:18,809
to this is a real URL spoon emoji ws

260
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:22,258
there is an entire RFC dedicated to add

261
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:24,420
I swear that's not me I'm not gonna move

262
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:26,519
anymore okay there is an entire RFC

263
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,309
dedicated to describing how to convert

264
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,439
that emoji into Unicode to be able to

265
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:34,350
use just Latin characters to be able to

266
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:37,199
describe the URL um you can also use

267
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,350
emoji in your crew strings but you

268
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:42,799
cannot use emoji in specific places

269
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,509
otherwise and we'll get to that because

270
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,069
ha9 can use emoji you can also use

271
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:48,869
extended characters you can also use

272
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:51,689
your right to left so you can get

273
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:52,709
wonderful URLs like this where depending

274
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:54,449
on the browser it will flip it around

275
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,529
and it'll look like that and then it

276
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:59,309
looks like it's encrypted but it's

277
00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:01,799
actually that so yeah that's been fixed

278
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:03,149
now which is great um also another thing

279
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:06,209
in Safari which is really interesting

280
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:08,790
you cannot use the lock emoji in your

281
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:11,729
tab bar because it would make it look

282
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:14,610
like say your site was secure so that's

283
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:17,339
cool um also you can pop shells with

284
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,919
emoji well you can power shell with

285
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:22,129
emoji this has been recently going

286
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,499
around Twitter as the sunset protocol

287
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:28,139
sunset so you can make some really sick

288
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:29,669
obstacle and then you can make it so you

289
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:31,709
can't actually see the fact that you're

290
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:33,689
calling PowerShell from your things and

291
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,579
it's cool because it's like hey look I

292
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:38,790
got PowerShell it's like shell bit

293
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:41,579
powerful anyway but you can't use emoji

294
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:47,130
in PowerShell which is sad but

295
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:48,959
the best thing this is the biggest thing

296
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,910
that I've ever seen happening where

297
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,599
emoji could have broken the entire

298
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,069
Internet

299
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,870
who here has heard of WordPress

300
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:00,839
WordPress runs a lot of the internet who

301
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:04,019
here has heard of MySQL who here runs

302
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,440
MySQL who he makes sure that they have

303
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:09,690
strict all tables set great if you don't

304
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,470
there's next bits for you let's get back

305
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:15,540
to our be actually this B this B has a

306
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:19,290
particular code point this is our code

307
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,849
point this is four bytes there is a

308
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,610
particular issue when you do not have

309
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:27,480
strict tables enabled and you use utf-8

310
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:30,450
in MySQL if you used utf-8 m before

311
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,279
you're fine if you use utf-8 assuming it

312
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,920
would be actually utf-8 compliant it's

313
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,070
not and you get fun stuff like this if

314
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,890
I'm on a wordpress blog and with my

315
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:44,399
malicious black hat on I could type in

316
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,970
something like this this just turns up

317
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,550
like Oh

318
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,100
besides Wellington is awesome except I

319
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:54,089
have a been in there if you have a

320
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,880
WordPress version lower than 4.2 I

321
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,110
believe and you have MySQL and you do

322
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,329
not have strict tables and you have

323
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:04,860
utf-8 it will drop your input at the B

324
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:08,219
which means you could then put in

325
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,399
another comment which is the rest of

326
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,649
your injection script because the angle

327
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,110
bracket script is stopped client-side

328
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:17,430
but you don't need the starting bracket

329
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,170
you've got that in your previous comment

330
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:22,079
so as soon as you load the page again

331
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,360
you have the first bit and then your

332
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,649
quote with no ending double quote and

333
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,290
then you have the rest of your script

334
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,300
and then your site explodes because

335
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,880
you've got cross-site scripting attacks

336
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,079
all because of that little B isn't that

337
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,179
wonderful

338
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,179
