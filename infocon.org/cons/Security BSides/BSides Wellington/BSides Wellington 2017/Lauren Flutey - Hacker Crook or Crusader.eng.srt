1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,469
so I'm Lauren thanks you run for having

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,840
me here today it's a really big honor to

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,700
be at this conference and talking on

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,460
people who are really industry leaders

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,110
in this area so I haven't committed my

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,870
speech to memory so just be with me as I

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,280
read my notes today I'm presenting a

8
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:24,170
very short summary of my honours

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,610
research that I've just finished so I'm

10
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,980
currently doing my master's degree and

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,720
information systems I'm here at Vic and

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,260
I also work with a great group of people

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,579
at PwC and the cyber team just in

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,608
advance I apologize for the use of the

15
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:40,219
word cyber especially given the previous

16
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:44,059
talk but I do agree with that talk as

17
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:46,100
well so yeah so I'm Peter we see is a

18
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:47,300
graduate security analyst now and I've

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,819
been there since seize out of the year

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,559
so thankfully the phenomena that I set

21
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:54,319
out to prove and my research actually

22
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:57,289
exists or at least albeit with a small

23
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:58,670
sample that I took so are we taking my

24
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:02,350
findings to a larger scale over summer

25
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:04,849
for completion of my master's degree

26
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,860
yeah so I apologize for the use of the

27
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,509
word cyber my research has a few

28
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,700
purposes so the overarching purpose

29
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:12,860
being to prove what I was observing was

30
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,509
actually taking place so I've noticed

31
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,670
people and you guys for the hem as well

32
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:19,340
typically non security specialists or

33
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,750
non techies in general like in a broader

34
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,729
sense they tend to hold some really

35
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,549
specific thoughts and opinions of who or

36
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:26,270
what a heck it might be I cringed at the

37
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:28,399
use of the word hacker

38
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:31,250
so I didn't attempt to define the word

39
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:32,930
but I just let it be so I feel like pop

40
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,430
culture news media and generally

41
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,380
speaking the sensitive nature of

42
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:39,619
security or factorization would

43
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,149
contribute to those perceptions so a way

44
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,130
that I like to explain this explain this

45
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:46,850
in short to people it's by asking the

46
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:54,158
simple questions so oh sorry oh my

47
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:56,899
goodness sorry just be with me okay so

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,429
by asking a simple question so how do

49
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:00,950
you picture what do you picture when you

50
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:02,359
might when someone sees hacker generally

51
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,969
this explains the existence of the

52
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,350
phenomena that I set out to prove but if

53
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:07,339
I were to ask this audience right here

54
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,320
I'd probably get a totally different

55
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,300
response or at least I hope I'd get a

56
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,340
really different response so nonetheless

57
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,349
if you picture a teenager in a dark room

58
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,450
awake all night hacking whatever that

59
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:18,230
might be then you're not alone so my

60
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,670
research sample

61
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,010
thanks the same with some interesting

62
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,390
findings so to investigate this

63
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,649
phenomena I crafted two research

64
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,679
questions as a starting point

65
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,269
what stereotypes if any does the general

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,610
public associate with terms including

67
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:33,650
hacker hacking cybercrime or computer

68
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,920
computer hacker and what are the

69
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,269
characteristics of these perceptions so

70
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,129
be honest what are the social

71
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:41,989
governmental and business implications

72
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:47,720
for how these perceived hackers are

73
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:48,920
portrayed and public discourse so the

74
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,810
problems caused by these perceptions

75
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,089
developed as I conducted the research

76
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,860
yes it's bad that people assume hackers

77
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,420
to fit a certain mold but what's worse

78
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,220
than this is the disconnect and lack of

79
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,988
fear or awareness a lot of people have

80
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,239
this reflex and their own security

81
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:03,950
behaviors the lack of awareness was

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,920
extremely apparent and what's worse is

83
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:09,018
the company lack of care so to quote one

84
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,328
of my interviewees my if postponed is

85
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:14,840
the same as my phone pin haha actually

86
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:17,690
probably change that which yeah you can

87
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,069
make of that what you will so then I

88
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,410
wondered what are the implications of

89
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:22,970
this beside really for security what

90
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,739
does this mean for wider society let

91
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,510
alone the security industry but also

92
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:31,849
like why have I opened this can of worms

93
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:33,230
so like most research I spend a lot of

94
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:35,328
my time performing my literature review

95
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,099
and at the side of my university career

96
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,099
I never imagined I'd have to analyze

97
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:42,440
Angelina Jolie's 90s classic hackers but

98
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:44,480
here we are and as expected it didn't

99
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,370
help me to define hacking but it did act

100
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,340
as an integral influencer to society's

101
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,239
perceptions of hacking so I mean about

102
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,650
proving this problem through a

103
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,239
qualitative assessment of my findings

104
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,340
which were gathered through a series of

105
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,470
ten interviews of teen people or

106
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,530
confidential in nature these 10 people

107
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,609
were intended to represent society and

108
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,410
to address the elephant in the room I

109
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:05,209
realized that teen is a really small

110
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,769
sample to conduct from but I wanted to

111
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:08,599
use qualitative methods at least to

112
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,389
begin with so I could gather data that I

113
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,099
couldn't really measure with numbers

114
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:15,260
however I plan to move to a quantitative

115
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:18,228
for my next stage so I can like really

116
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,029
have a broader scale for my research so

117
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:22,039
the individuals who participated were

118
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,448
from a range of professions some of

119
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:25,699
which include a hairdresser a wine

120
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:27,590
grower and electrician carpenters and

121
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,570
importantly one security professional

122
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,380
and other professions including some

123
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,030
students so 19

124
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,580
questions were developed and of these

125
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,739
questions were five topics and including

126
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,490
attitudes to attacking personal security

127
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,260
behaviors

128
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:45,030
hacktivism piracy and legal matters so

129
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,800
now to get to the surprising and the

130
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,380
unsurprising findings starting with

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,290
awareness so important to note here as

132
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,060
the asterisk which means that whatever

133
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,970
is stated as excluding the security

134
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,000
specialist who I interviewed thank god

135
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:03,600
so he essentially ended up being a

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,280
control of sorts so that was good so all

137
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,230
interviewees excluding the specialist

138
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,450
expressed confusion towards a topic of

139
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,950
cyber crime a lot of arms and as we said

140
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,840
as well as a lot of I don't knows

141
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,940
relating to all five question topic

142
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,890
areas again none of the interviewees

143
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,390
apart from the security specialist knew

144
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,130
what the suit was or what the function

145
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,630
may include people did make some

146
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,700
reasonable assumptions though including

147
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,920
cert being a fire brigade for computers

148
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,050
and just important to note here when I

149
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,120
was a sitting cert I wasn't assessing so

150
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:34,770
indeed specifically but rather suits as

151
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,620
a I guess global industrial construct so

152
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,060
the next section being understanding

153
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,680
nine out of ten interviewees were

154
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,870
accepting or not concerned about piracy

155
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,000
despite admitting to protecting in it

156
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,980
and while I hold no no opinion about

157
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,670
piracy I found it alarming that none of

158
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:53,250
these individuals had heard of VPN so it

159
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,720
appeared that a major disconnect existed

160
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,610
with individual understandings of

161
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,770
cybercrime and the lack of security

162
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,150
measures that people had in place so if

163
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,219
you were aware that cybercrime is a

164
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,109
problem but don't seem to really relate

165
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,730
it to their lives it's like a dissonant

166
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,570
message that they just don't act upon

167
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,650
apart from the security specialist

168
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,080
possibly the most important topic was

169
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,940
influence which drew forth some alarming

170
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,650
but not really surprising results so

171
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,090
seven out of ten individuals solely

172
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,370
reference external means for their

173
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,320
reasoning such as online sources and

174
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,210
news media and only three drew from

175
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,099
internal reasoning such as comparison to

176
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,739
other crimes or experience be it

177
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,510
personal or otherwise so of the sample

178
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,550
of ten nine people worst confusion

179
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,050
frustration or general concern for the

180
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,380
poor media portrayal of cyber security

181
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,120
related events so I say cyber security

182
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,370
really broadly because to some people

183
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,510
that means to come calm but to some

184
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,130
people what it means like completely

185
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,180
different things altogether but I

186
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,979
deliberately didn't

187
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,419
to define that sort of realm so I found

188
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,310
it really concerning which raises

189
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,599
another problem that people are

190
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,370
consuming media from sources they

191
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,440
consider unreliable but they're not

192
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,850
really bothering to get to the truth so

193
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,729
I don't know about you guys but I find

194
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:07,199
that quite worrisome so I found some

195
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,599
unexpected findings about perceived

196
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,039
characteristics of hackers I'm sorry for

197
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,800
the boring table but I think it's pretty

198
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,990
good so sex people feel that heck is

199
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,340
illogical technically smart or something

200
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,620
along the lines of intelligent

201
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,289
this was an unexpected finding as for

202
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,940
the previous literature that Odysseus so

203
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:26,940
an odd utilization or assumption

204
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,310
appeared so here we are and it's not

205
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,259
targeted at anyone so four out of ten

206
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,180
individuals mentioned participation and

207
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,669
World of Warcraft to be an attribute of

208
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,410
a hacker make of it what you will and I

209
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:38,250
didn't remotely prompt people to mention

210
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,990
World of Warcraft

211
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,199
it was rather from participant made

212
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:45,210
comments alone so I figured this might

213
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,160
be a reference to like gaming and gaming

214
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,719
culture in general and this was just how

215
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,919
people kind of explained it because it

216
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,470
might have stood out as like a prolific

217
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,870
example but nonetheless that forms a

218
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,310
notable trend so general nerdiness was

219
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,280
mentioned as well as being awake all

220
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,930
night I feel like my participants might

221
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,539
know some pretty committed gamers or

222
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:09,240
what they deem to possibly be hackers so

223
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:11,099
another boring table I'm sorry but I

224
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,080
also measured the frequency and nature

225
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:16,229
have sent out cyber related events their

226
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,990
participants mentioned so broadly and

227
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,310
the realm of cyber so the chemcam saga

228
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,620
was mentioned by nine out of ten

229
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,300
interviewees and I'll get to why shortly

230
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,460
but you can probably imagine why so

231
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,949
monochrome was mentioned either directly

232
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,880
or indirectly three times as was snowed

233
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:35,430
Edward or should I say it would Snowden

234
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,708
and the American elections mentioned in

235
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:39,328
a very broad sense so important to note

236
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,458
here there were more characteristics

237
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:42,929
that were mentioned but I'm just

238
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:46,079
including the ones that had really high

239
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:47,489
frequencies so people reiterated across

240
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,439
the interviews their confusion about

241
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,149
these about these in other events

242
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,950
so two admitted they tried to follow

243
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:54,690
news headlines about these particular

244
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,060
incidents but found it too difficult to

245
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,290
follow and otherwise didn't know really

246
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,969
like where to find out more

247
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,279
so the coats the quite sunscreen

248
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,689
demonstrate this but there are certainly

249
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,129
more throughout my transcripts of the

250
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:10,319
similar sorts of comments alluding to

251
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:12,509
the same things all right so to long

252
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:14,459
didn't read or what academics refer to

253
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:17,269
is the conclusion what does this all

254
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:19,559
mean so a high level of participation oh

255
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:21,689
sorry a high level of intelligence

256
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,189
participation in Wow and general

257
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:24,899
nerdiness are characteristics of a

258
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:27,238
hacker at least for the sample that I

259
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,739
get it it seems a few of my friends

260
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:31,709
might be hackers after all based on this

261
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:33,329
logic furthermore the chemcam saga for

262
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,599
which I hold a neutral stance was a

263
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:38,339
standout event related to cyber metas

264
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,369
generally at least to non-specialists so

265
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,449
most importantly and unexpectedly

266
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:44,100
interviewees were mostly dissatisfied

267
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:46,469
with media reporting on the topic of

268
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,729
chem comm and wider security security

269
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:52,319
and cyber crime related events so what

270
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:55,109
do these mean for the widest cyber

271
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:57,599
security industry I can assume from my

272
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:59,489
findings that sorry that the perceptions

273
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,350
were taken generally they may cause

274
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:03,179
social government to and business

275
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,549
implications whether we realize it or

276
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,079
not importantly I think my findings are

277
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:08,999
significant to policy development going

278
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:11,279
forward and IT and security areas

279
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:12,749
because individuals and organizations

280
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,119
may act according to these perceptions

281
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:20,730
or at least their preconceived ideas or

282
00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:22,579
lack of care and awareness so distrust

283
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,439
for news media has major repercussions

284
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:27,419
what sources will people turn to if they

285
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:29,279
don't know who to trust and of course

286
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,600
security behaviors so if people think

287
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,399
that hackers are just well players who

288
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,689
have too much time they may be a little

289
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,730
bit less inclined to improve their

290
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:37,289
security practices and this definitely

291
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,029
relates to an organizational level as

292
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:40,259
well

293
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:42,239
so just because the crime may be less

294
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:43,739
tangible than a physical crime it

295
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:47,689
doesn't really make it any less damaging

296
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:50,069
and hopefully we're all aware of that so

297
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:52,259
that pretty much wraps up my talk and

298
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:55,409
thank you all for listening to my first

299
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:58,139
ever talk so if you want to find out

300
00:10:55,409 --> 00:11:00,449
more I definitely want to hear people's

301
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,429
critiques constructive criticisms and

302
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:04,589
this sort of thing along these lines so

303
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:06,919
hit me up at my Twitter will talk to me

304
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,919
after this

305
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,579
you
