1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:11,910
and good afternoon can you hear me up

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:14,309
the back no maybe ghetto guys my name's

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,970
Edward Fowle I also go by the name of

4
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,970
the fuzz and my talk is on we're using

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:25,229
breach data from both an offensive

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:28,200
standpoint but also just how we can also

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,360
employ it from a a defensive standpoint

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,839
just out of curiosity how many people

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,929
here pen testers or bug bounty hunters

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,100
or or what have you

11
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:42,839
cool defenders boo teams excellent so

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,589
there's there's a good mix actually

13
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:48,079
probably more blue than red out here so

14
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:50,399
just to give you a bit of background

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,469
about myself so I've been working the

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,559
security space now for for eight years

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:59,729
mostly on the the offensive side I often

18
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,399
find myself diving between both both

19
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:05,640
offense and and defense but mostly from

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,650
the B side of you know thinking through

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,770
how would you as a threat actor or or a

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,799
threat do some sort of harm to an

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:19,439
organization so I never on my own team

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:23,009
in Sydney I have two staff a couple of

25
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,439
support folk and I am looking at hiring

26
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,180
sometime in the next 12 months so if

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,240
you're interested to come up and say

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,530
g'day but most of the work we do works

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,469
on the depend testing space but it kind

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,539
of has as I've had out of the last two

31
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,460
and a half three years we've found

32
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:44,009
ourselves stepping back a lot further in

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,979
terms of as opposed to just doing a

34
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:50,429
simple test or a simple VA understanding

35
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,439
what a lot of this understanding a lot

36
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:54,899
of what the the actual threat means to

37
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,419
the company or even coming back and

38
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,340
rethinking true end and going through

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,759
what's actually gonna make this

40
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,670
someone's worst day so off the back that

41
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,960
we've been doing a number of interesting

42
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:10,199
pieces of research around the space

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,359
especially around things like like

44
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,649
reconnaissance and understanding our

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,330
customers but also things around events

46
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,120
that have been taking place such as

47
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:27,150
breaches on top of us are also lecture

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:30,690
at UNSW Canberra as well mostly in in

49
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:34,260
the wild security space and Internet of

50
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,550
Things which if you're actually looking

51
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,649
at going to university next year we've

52
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:41,520
we will have Faraday cages they're so

53
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:45,150
happy days so what are data breaches

54
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,220
this is the definition I'm pretty sure I

55
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,340
pulled it from Wikipedia or Captain

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,830
James chopped and changed it but a data

57
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,720
breach is an incident where a sensitive

58
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,290
protected or confidential data has been

59
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,620
viewed stolen unauthorised can be things

60
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,940
like personal health information

61
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,140
anything personally identifiable trade

62
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,459
secrets or intellectual property now for

63
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,130
the context of this talk the thing where

64
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,600
we are looking at is really heavily

65
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,450
going to be around things such as users

66
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:18,299
and passwords but there's other pieces

67
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,480
of data there as well that that's fairly

68
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,660
interesting in and so just to go through

69
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,700
it there's been some form of disclosure

70
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,090
or or occasional instances of disclosure

71
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,640
since about 2005 so doing a bit of

72
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,250
research on this the the first instance

73
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,200
of this I believe was a while back and

74
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,160
about oh five or it was actually yep

75
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,660
this event took place we've lost a heap

76
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,900
of data we then started seeing

77
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:49,829
especially with the rise of one second

78
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:53,040
2010 we started seeing what more

79
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,050
significant occurrences of this taking

80
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,989
place they also start to become quite

81
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,120
public and are now almost commonplace so

82
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:04,680
we've already had this week the whole

83
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,150
piece on on over the losing 57 million

84
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,140
records and if you have all the

85
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:15,900
screenshots on yes that's on your left

86
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,000
sorry my left I just flew in last

87
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,989
night so if you have a look at the

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,910
screenshot on your right we'll see any

89
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,370
reach from information is beautiful doc

90
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,590
that we're since about 2010 we've seen

91
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,030
not only the the volume of these

92
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,080
breaches increase but we've also seen

93
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:36,039
the size of the content

94
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,310
that's been disclosed increasing as well

95
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,630
now what's also been a another piece

96
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,190
it's been quite peculiar about these

97
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:47,260
breaches is that knowledge of their

98
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:49,450
events will become public long after the

99
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,099
actual breach has taken place so

100
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,780
LinkedIn for example and I'll reference

101
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,290
LinkedIn here a lot

102
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,969
just because from a a pen tester and and

103
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,420
offensive security standpoint it's been

104
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,890
an awesome breach to use that occurred

105
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,410
in 2012 but we didn't know anything

106
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:10,330
about it until the beginning of 2016 so

107
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,700
what some of the content we see in

108
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,289
breaches such as this so emails phone

109
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,820
numbers and other contact information is

110
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,520
what's there and that's going to be the

111
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,349
personally identifiable piece of

112
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,390
associated an individual with that set

113
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,810
of data will also start seeing things

114
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:27,250
such as home address and contact details

115
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,530
in there a lot but what's been really

116
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:34,360
curious whoops now sites see a reduction

117
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:38,349
in the number of credit cards that have

118
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,630
have been publicly disclosed now if you

119
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:44,050
go back to say the Stratfor breach in

120
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:46,210
2010 credit cards were in there a lot

121
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,340
but a lot of people have now actually

122
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,109
sad decline of hey I probably shouldn't

123
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,270
hold that sort of information anymore or

124
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,360
it's actually cheaper to make it someone

125
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:57,190
else's problem and outsource it things

126
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,390
such as correspondence email addresses

127
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,300
sms's

128
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,979
or internal messaging systems within an

129
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,960
application may also be present and that

130
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,670
in itself may contain data but that

131
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,650
usually takes a bit of time to analyze

132
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:12,250
and every now and then will things see

133
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:15,549
things such as scanned ID IDs IP

134
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:20,370
addresses from points of origin or some

135
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:22,630
sort of other context specific material

136
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,410
so where's my interest and what have

137
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:28,300
been some of my early observations for

138
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,920
this so I originally started diving to

139
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,660
this just because I really started

140
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,250
having a bit of interest in some of the

141
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:38,590
data that was out there and I'm probably

142
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,600
the first instance this was breach

143
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,150
against the ABC in Australia back in

144
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,870
2013 going through it you could actually

145
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,120
start to

146
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,640
not only identified some of the

147
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,550
passwords that were there being

148
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,190
associated with well-known individuals

149
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:59,210
but peculiar I started coming across

150
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:02,410
that hey the two or three admin hashes

151
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:07,700
that were in the system were in fact

152
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:10,040
being sawed forward for cracking on a on

153
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,590
a Russian forum and it was evident that

154
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,540
the site had actually been breached

155
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,429
long before so off the back of just this

156
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,260
little bit of data it's like hey we've

157
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:23,210
actually seen that someone probably beat

158
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,550
beat Anonymous or whoever made claims to

159
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,070
the hack about a year or two prior to it

160
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,410
I assume once I've been doing as well

161
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:34,940
have been around the Ashley Madison Bri

162
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:36,740
trove from about two years ago so things

163
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:41,180
I've actually enjoyed looking at have

164
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:45,560
been have been along the lines of

165
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:48,160
correlating the addresses within Sydney

166
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,590
and socioeconomic status so for example

167
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,840
there were more fake accounts set up on

168
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,869
the lower North Shore of Sydney than

169
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,549
there were in say Western Sydney it's

170
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:03,320
also been interesting correlating that

171
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:08,140
data with your own personal with your

172
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:10,310
own personal email addresses and and

173
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,919
email addresses of people that you know

174
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:16,150
that's that's curious to see who

175
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:19,010
actually used their their real address

176
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:21,349
but the the best one for me so far has

177
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,280
actually probably been around the

178
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,200
LinkedIn breach

179
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,169
I'm also because that's what most people

180
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,700
in business have been using it's also

181
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,530
been fairly accessible in the there's

182
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,120
always for us there's always actually

183
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,370
been an account that would be able to

184
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,289
find but just as a general observation

185
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,169
probably the the more the most

186
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:41,030
significant disclosure I I believe that

187
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,890
was out there was probably around

188
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,199
Stratfor and that was more to do with

189
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:49,100
the people Stratfor how does their

190
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,370
clients and the the nature of that

191
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:56,150
breach inanity outcome probably the

192
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:58,220
large one of significance of families

193
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:01,400
around Yahoo but

194
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,910
I'll always come back linkedIn has for a

195
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,069
very long time being very useful for

196
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:09,260
identifying passwords and identifying

197
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,880
password behaviors and I'll show that in

198
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,710
a sec but probably the most balancing

199
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,330
one has in fact been though being out of

200
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:20,450
websites so yeah just Ashley Madison is

201
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:24,580
has a really rich bit of data of that

202
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:27,050
that really points to some interesting

203
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:30,980
some interesting behaviors by by a

204
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:32,990
number of individuals so what actually

205
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,500
really spurred my interest was in fact

206
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:40,250
my own password being in the LinkedIn

207
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,500
breach and being quite easy to to crack

208
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,880
so this this was my password before

209
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,890
anyone wants to go and try and use it I

210
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,439
don't I actually went through every

211
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:54,110
service I'd used in the five or ten

212
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,600
years prior to this event to verify that

213
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:00,380
I was no longer no longer using it I

214
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,270
think I found about two or three

215
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,680
instances where I still was and this is

216
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,140
kind of what sparked my interested well

217
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,839
if if I'm doing this then surely

218
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:12,610
someone's probably still doing this

219
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:17,060
elsewhere say within their organization

220
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:22,460
or within other services that they use

221
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:24,439
as a part of their business so what some

222
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,670
of the stuff that can be relevant to us

223
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:31,160
when we're doing say a business-related

224
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:37,219
penta so IP addresses and correlation

225
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:38,689
with corporate proxies so Ashley Madison

226
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,110
I'll come back to Ashley Madison is the

227
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:45,620
example there you're it's actually quite

228
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:48,560
easy to stop pulling out so he was a in

229
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,140
one case we found so the one we actually

230
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,290
used for correlating corporate proxies

231
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,819
was in fact the proxy for the Australian

232
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,969
Parliament House where you could

233
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:02,870
actually start going through and

234
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:04,100
identifying not only IP address accounts

235
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,870
that have been signing in from that IP

236
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,580
address but we were then also able to

237
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,880
align up with date of birth with people

238
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,880
that we know are in that facility and

239
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,220
off the back of that

240
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,570
start extrapolating other data about

241
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:21,090
them if you're able to start stitching

242
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,900
together a number of data sources you

243
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,870
could actually start identifying

244
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:28,770
password sequences or behaviors so if

245
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:31,410
one target we had a look at had managed

246
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:34,890
to incorporate the word bounty in their

247
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,600
password consistently and could simply

248
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:42,270
just increment or decrement that number

249
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:44,010
is required so it can also start

250
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,990
extrapolating a little bit of data on

251
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,850
human and behavioral analysis such as

252
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,010
logging times if it's there but a lot of

253
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:55,920
that's going to be dependent on the sort

254
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:57,660
of information you have the other one as

255
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,790
well is around people who are

256
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,459
maintaining the same password across

257
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,620
multiple sites which is something that

258
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,650
we consistently see in those will

259
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:10,200
typically be our first targets but also

260
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,630
the other one is well as use of this

261
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,390
data in things such as blackmail or

262
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,460
corporate espionage or or financial gain

263
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:20,069
and I'll talk about an incident we dealt

264
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:23,940
with a little earlier this year on that

265
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:26,340
but things like adult web sites are

266
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,440
incredibly powerful when you need to

267
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,000
actually say that yes this person has

268
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,670
been using this web site we can then

269
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,650
also correlate their reuse of the linked

270
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,390
in their LinkedIn password with their

271
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,910
Ashley Madison password and there's no

272
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:42,330
way they can deny that they've been on

273
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:45,089
these systems so what are some of the

274
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,950
issues with with maintaining the sort of

275
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,050
data so our purposes we're saying

276
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:51,240
welcome I'm not a lawyer at the end of

277
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:54,120
the day you're gaining and making views

278
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,250
of information that has been thieved at

279
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,770
some point in time and it's been

280
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,810
disclosed by someone and it's it's it's

281
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,860
somewhere out in the open but I always

282
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:07,319
come back to said well how this is

283
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:09,390
differ from from eternal blue or one

284
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:14,820
acquires have eventually evolved into in

285
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:19,380
that someone was effectively able to use

286
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:22,500
the code that was provided to create the

287
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:25,350
eternal blue exploit and publicly use it

288
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,720
do we also make use of that exact same

289
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,360
exposure from a defensive standpoint and

290
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,740
I understand how this works how we're

291
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,070
gonna patch it and then off the back of

292
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,960
that use it in a defensive in a

293
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,850
defensive mechanism so it's been one of

294
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:43,740
these peculiarities of yep

295
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:46,050
I have data that has been stolen and has

296
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,940
been disclosed but for me I always come

297
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,060
back to this whole well we're using a

298
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:54,480
firm a defensive standpoint of we're

299
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,459
trying to help organizations not reuse

300
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,530
what we're trying to help individuals

301
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:03,030
within an organization not reuse their

302
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:05,850
password and this kind of leads to my

303
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:08,780
next point we've already seen indicators

304
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:15,680
that suggest this is already in use so

305
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:20,040
does so if anyone has any visibility on

306
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,270
on either on any points that have been

307
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,189
used for it for logins if they've seen

308
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:25,319
any credential has anyone seen any

309
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:28,230
credential stuffing attacks in the last

310
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,600
12 months coming through any welcome to

311
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:33,000
anyway yep yep so down the back there

312
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,440
I've and this this also came a

313
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,530
discussion point with a colleague of

314
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,900
mine who runs an Australian film called

315
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,350
casada where they were using some of the

316
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,699
data that we had in fact gathered on

317
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,410
email addresses relating to one of their

318
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,420
customers the back of which they're

319
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,760
saying well we're able to correlate this

320
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,250
with the LinkedIn breach someone appears

321
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:59,640
to be consistently using that breach

322
00:14:53,250 --> 00:15:02,370
data in order to gain access to to two

323
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,780
email accounts and interestingly enough

324
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,970
Sam and I were talking about this last

325
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,530
week and he was saying well we're

326
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,390
already starting to see it again and

327
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:14,280
it's typically occurring off several

328
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:20,550
specific sites funnily enough in August

329
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:23,699
2017 my team and I got called in to a to

330
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:29,250
an instant response this was by a couple

331
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:31,400
of lawyers based in Brisbane who we're

332
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,750
trying to understand how exactly this

333
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:37,980
attack had occurred on one of their

334
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,100
customers so these guys were were an

335
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,310
Australian supplier

336
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,620
resold goods in Australia and they had

337
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:47,050
this interesting piece of Correspondence

338
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,710
from one of their US suppliers as the

339
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:53,770
u.s. supply used office365 they did have

340
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:56,350
to factor or thin abled and they were

341
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,420
trying to establish how one of their

342
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:03,280
account managers accounts had in fact

343
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:05,740
been compromised and now there was no

344
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,980
evidence of a social engineering attack

345
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,740
there was no indication that there was

346
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:15,730
any targeted attacks on that individuals

347
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:19,150
local machine but I guess for us this

348
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:22,140
was a case well the the simplest

349
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:24,310
explanation is often the correct one and

350
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:27,010
we said hey we'll look we've got all

351
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,630
this breach data you know what what's

352
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:30,300
this individuals email address off the

353
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:33,960
back of which you were able to say well

354
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:36,310
is this your password turns out it was

355
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,860
but what was procuring about that whole

356
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:41,020
interaction wasn't so much the technical

357
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,080
sophistication that had taken place it

358
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,810
was I would say fairly operationally

359
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:50,020
sophisticated in that the correspondence

360
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:52,839
that was maintained was very specific

361
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:57,790
the language that was used was

362
00:16:52,840 --> 00:17:02,400
consistent with the the victims actual

363
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:04,569
method of talking via email and it

364
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,819
turned into a hey we need you to update

365
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:09,250
your payment details to send us a

366
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:13,060
quarter of a million dollars to a new

367
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:15,880
corporate bank account in Hong Kong so

368
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,560
with very little sophistication this

369
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,270
thread actor was able to impersonate

370
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,589
someone getting access to their account

371
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:29,260
and walk away with about a quarter of a

372
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:32,260
million dollars Australian so in terms

373
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:35,680
of how we get the the data that we use

374
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:39,820
for this breach correction in terms of

375
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:44,290
how we get this breach data and organize

376
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:47,139
it we try and opt so my team and I try

377
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:50,230
and look forwards publicly available we

378
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,640
is several sources and if you'd like I'm

379
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:56,150
happy to provide the the links to

380
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,179
some publicly available sources for the

381
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,130
starter but the reason why we go for

382
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:03,159
that public data is one it means that

383
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:06,890
we're not actually trading in in

384
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:09,620
information or we're not helping people

385
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,090
profit from it but it's also this is the

386
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,229
information that is out there and it's

387
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,020
probably the information that's going to

388
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:19,640
getting used and in terms of verifying

389
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:22,700
authenticity now this is kind of a

390
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,299
curious one I think for the the most

391
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,559
part and I was asking this question

392
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:29,270
myself about two or three days ago of

393
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:34,279
how authentic is some of the datasets we

394
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:36,320
haven't in one sense it's kind of

395
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,549
relevant because we wanted to actually

396
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,580
store information that's going to be

397
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:44,450
relevant for us but in another sense

398
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,428
it's kind of one of those things that

399
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,950
we've just got to say well we were not

400
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:51,679
too fussed at this stage but it would be

401
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:55,909
curious to sort of over time increase

402
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,440
the the verification that what we have

403
00:18:55,909 --> 00:19:00,620
is true and accurate and it's actually a

404
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,809
irrelevant risk now when it comes to

405
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,120
managing some of the large data sets

406
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:07,100
that we we do have when we're doing this

407
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,428
as a proof of concept we were just

408
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:13,158
taking the raw data and just graphing it

409
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:16,520
which took a lot of time so over time

410
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,440
we've built out a database that we have

411
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,020
we've got a simple API that plugs into a

412
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:26,270
couple of other services that were we're

413
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:28,850
getting up and running but this that

414
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:30,649
takes a little bit of time to evolve and

415
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,590
right now in its current form we're just

416
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:35,059
using a very simple database structure

417
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,399
with user names passwords and other

418
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:40,700
interesting data that we have against

419
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:43,370
individuals so when it comes for our

420
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,140
attack sequence a lot of this is you

421
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,870
know pretty comments for the pentesting

422
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:50,419
stuff in that we try and understand who

423
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,879
the the organization is first and we try

424
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:54,700
and enumerate everything associated with

425
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,110
them so things such as web applications

426
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,399
how they authenticating what's the

427
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,918
network infrastructure they have in

428
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:02,360
place cloud-based assets is another

429
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:05,370
interesting one that I think is

430
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:09,209
something that we overlooked from both a

431
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,590
attack and defense standpoint off the

432
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,460
back of this we then have to start

433
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:17,000
mapping out social interactions and

434
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:20,160
individual and individual personalities

435
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,170
we also tend to identify some key

436
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,140
players that interest us based on the

437
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:28,110
target we're researching so whether it's

438
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,670
c-level executives or people who are

439
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,679
responsible for maintaining the accounts

440
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,090
go to a greater level of detail in

441
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,930
understanding who they are what their

442
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:39,540
personal email addresses are and try and

443
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,280
establish as much as we can off the back

444
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,399
of the the sort of breach data that we

445
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:49,710
particularly maintain against those

446
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:53,040
individuals and this kind of leads a bit

447
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,750
more into into that from that technical

448
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,649
domain into that sort of personal domain

449
00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:01,200
of getting an understanding of of both

450
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,570
the staff but also evaluating third

451
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,470
party so if you had a look previously

452
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:09,899
the talk that I was delivering as her

453
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,000
the instant response that my team and I

454
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,250
had dealt with was around that third

455
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,360
party interaction on the back while

456
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:22,140
compromising one individual within a

457
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,879
supplier the individuals that were

458
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,210
looking to get a quarter million dollars

459
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,740
out of Australian company were able to

460
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:33,450
map out understand those interactions

461
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:35,730
and exploit them a username structures

462
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,860
are also another interesting one to to

463
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,750
understand and they're quite important

464
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,500
when it comes to to undertaking an

465
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,960
attack

466
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:47,040
same-same with email addresses you also

467
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,800
heard me before talking about how breach

468
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,830
data will actually be quite dated so you

469
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,629
think about your average Australian they

470
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,879
typically move companies every two to

471
00:21:54,630 --> 00:22:00,420
three years so doing a simple domain

472
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:04,530
search on your target organization may

473
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:07,130
not in fact be enough and so if you

474
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,510
started to map out LinkedIn profiles

475
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,309
that are associated with your target

476
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,809
company you then need to step back a

477
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:16,800
little bit and start mapping out those

478
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:18,610
individuals as well so at the back of

479
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,309
that will usually come out

480
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,178
in a taxi at a tack surface that looks a

481
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:25,620
lot like this

482
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:28,240
so you'll usually have annexed a

483
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,889
corporate environment that that you'll

484
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,340
probably want to be looking at things

485
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,710
like citrix applications a VPN random

486
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,240
applications are always awesome on a on

487
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,179
a company's network usually because

488
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:44,110
someone's created them separate from the

489
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:45,429
the tag company but also because they're

490
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,469
usually not well maintained and they

491
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:52,570
have their own their own place for

492
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:55,240
authentication as a service platforms as

493
00:22:52,570 --> 00:23:00,490
I said before are also really peculiar

494
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:03,640
targets and this is going from get this

495
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,470
right going from left to right we start

496
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,480
to fall into these gray areas of well

497
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,660
what can we target and what is

498
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,190
legitimate for us to to exploit even

499
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,660
though when we get to the the right-hand

500
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:18,040
side and we're looking at individual and

501
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:21,270
personal accounts targeting these will

502
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:24,250
most certainly be out of scope because

503
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:27,160
when you are engaged in a penetration

504
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:29,559
test or a any sort of read to him for a

505
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,630
a business exploiting those personal

506
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:33,850
accounts is definitely beyond your scope

507
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:36,460
but then there's this gray area rival

508
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:41,199
are these as a service platforms owned

509
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:44,160
by the business or are they owned by by

510
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,160
the platform provider

511
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:51,670
but given that a lot of a lot of

512
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,050
companies nowadays don't maintain their

513
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:55,450
own infrastructure to mein plainly

514
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,560
maintain these platforms on you know

515
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:01,390
this is where the business is actually

516
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:04,020
going to be getting done so when we

517
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,730
start conducting attacks against

518
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,150
platforms such as this things we start

519
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:13,720
looking at do we have to change the user

520
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:16,600
name do we then also have to validate if

521
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,820
the the user name is correct or not if

522
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,510
we can log-in buyers just into a simple

523
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:24,760
password and then off the back this will

524
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:28,810
have things like there's some direct

525
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:31,270
password guessing against against the

526
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:34,030
known password or a historical password

527
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:37,930
and that use and I mean typically we

528
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:39,160
will have say the last company we tested

529
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:42,700
I think we had about a hundred and

530
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,350
twenty odd possible accounts we were

531
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,390
just testing simply username and

532
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,740
password combinations based on the users

533
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,600
that we were able to map out and

534
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,880
identify across about three or four

535
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,860
different applications we then have

536
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,180
small targeted password guessing so we

537
00:24:53,860 --> 00:25:00,820
started looking at c-level executives

538
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:03,670
who had multiple accounts from existing

539
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,760
breaches any different variations their

540
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:09,490
passwords such as incrementing numbers

541
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,320
changing seasons so on and so forth and

542
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,260
then layering it a bit of automation

543
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,240
with this is actually to be honest this

544
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,700
is still something that we're working

545
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,350
through mostly because a lot of the con

546
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:24,340
requires that human interaction and that

547
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:25,659
human analysis of understanding how an

548
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,870
individual behaves and what their

549
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,700
thoughts are on on what their password

550
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:36,219
is or or how they're going to have a

551
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:38,380
password structure so just out of

552
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,330
curiosity how how successful do you

553
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,610
think my team and I have been on those

554
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:48,550
sort of attacks who reckons more than

555
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:52,530
fifty percent yeah yep so who reckons

556
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:55,870
probably only every now and then yeah

557
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:58,090
yep so to be honest we'll probably only

558
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,830
get say out of a target list of a

559
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,929
hundred and twenty

560
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:05,760
and this is based off our last

561
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:08,620
engagement of a target list of 120

562
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,280
individual accounts we had enumerated we

563
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:14,590
only had access to two or three accounts

564
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:17,610
which look it's actually fairly low but

565
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:20,740
how how often we need to be successful

566
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,959
yeah just once so off the back of

567
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:26,290
gaining access to one of these accounts

568
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,910
the post exploitation scenarios who are

569
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,850
going to be dependent on what you've

570
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:34,740
compromised and what that means so for

571
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:39,610
the most part it's and for most of our

572
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:41,350
most of our our activities the thing

573
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,360
that our customers are concerned about

574
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,610
are the unauthorized access or

575
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,169
modification of information so being

576
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,840
able to gain access is probably the the

577
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:54,280
more significant piece we we have there

578
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:57,610
in in our taxes is that whole piece on

579
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:00,010
espionage so being able to go through

580
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:02,889
acquired data pillage it modify it

581
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:05,410
change it update data and update things

582
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,910
is usually the more significant attack

583
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,730
but once again this will always come

584
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,810
back to what what are you trying to

585
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,760
demonstrate and what are you trying to

586
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,770
get out of it there will be some

587
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,840
customers where we actually have to hold

588
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:21,420
on any post exploitation scenarios for

589
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:24,760
either a a a financial means or because

590
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,440
the executives are quite sensitive about

591
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,740
the activities you're taking especially

592
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,110
if you're in their email INBOX we then

593
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,180
have these assumed levels of trust which

594
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:36,490
leads into a a suite of social

595
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:38,800
engineering attacks so if you have

596
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:41,920
access to someone's email inbox and

597
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,200
there's no expectation that someone can

598
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,870
can perform that there's all of a sudden

599
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,640
this assumption that if you are within

600
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,469
the environment you're go secure and

601
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,740
from a social standpoint it becomes

602
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:56,200
quite easy to social engineer the the

603
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,520
targets you're looking at finally

604
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,310
there's this whole piece on persistence

605
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,170
you you heard me talk about the incident

606
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:04,060
response we had before we were looking

607
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:07,170
at several weeks of someone maintaining

608
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:09,310
access to that one email account

609
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,840
developing their understanding before

610
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:14,740
they actually conducted

611
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,030
any sort of attacks and this wasn't as I

612
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,130
said before this wasn't a technically

613
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,110
sophisticated attack it was we're in the

614
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,850
inbox we're learning their patterns of

615
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,310
life we're understanding how and who

616
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:28,899
they interact with and how that be used

617
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:30,370
on our m4 for an attack so that's kind

618
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,550
of where we look at things from an

619
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:35,530
offensive standpoint but what about the

620
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:38,290
existing security controls we have in

621
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:40,750
there so we're now talking about all

622
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,280
these mandatory mandatory disclosure

623
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:45,760
laws in Australia which will come into

624
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,800
effect in in February in their current

625
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,900
incarnation and some of the activities

626
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,149
are already seen in this space my

627
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:55,480
observations have been that a lot of it

628
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:57,820
is fairly ineffective in terms of being

629
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:04,270
able to support any follow-on defensive

630
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:07,149
actions so when we look at two-factor

631
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:09,730
authentication yeah that's going to stop

632
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,050
an attack like like that Denis tracks I

633
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:15,510
mean you'll probably still be able to

634
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:18,250
validate so on Google for example that

635
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,750
that the password is in fact valid but

636
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:23,020
off the back of that all of a sudden

637
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:26,110
that user may now have say an SMS give

638
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:28,440
us the here's you your second factor of

639
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,439
authentication

640
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:39,429
password management applications are

641
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:44,170
also fairly effective as long as they're

642
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:47,290
employed correctly the whole speed and

643
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:49,620
time of a password reset activity in a

644
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:52,480
non technical domain is also fairly slow

645
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,689
and so if all I need is that one little

646
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,030
attack that I can exploit within fifteen

647
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:00,730
minutes that's going to dislocate the

648
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:06,370
defense and your ability to reset and

649
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:08,050
prepare for or any follow-on events or

650
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:10,659
say if I've already got access and

651
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:13,470
you've just reset the password long I'm

652
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,430
just going to maintain that session

653
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,930
these are things that you probably want

654
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:20,050
to conceptualize from a defensive

655
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:24,130
standpoint finally have our been pound

656
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:27,100
is an awesome source for identifying yes

657
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:29,740
if your password was in in a breach but

658
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,320
I think for me the the thing that really

659
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,520
rang home that really sort of came home

660
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,879
for me was when I started to identify

661
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,100
what data was in these breaches and what

662
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,740
did the risk of that data mean for me as

663
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:44,040
an individual and this is kind of why I

664
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,840
talk about how we want to reorient a

665
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:50,050
defense let's actually show people

666
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,290
what's in in some of these data sets

667
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:54,520
that other people have out there on them

668
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:57,610
this is going to be far more effective

669
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,980
from a defensive standpoint than saying

670
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:02,290
have I been poned or doing a user

671
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,830
awareness session actually saying hey is

672
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:08,350
this your password are you still using

673
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,419
this password anywhere else do you want

674
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,100
to change your password will actually be

675
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:16,210
a far more effective way of capturing

676
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:18,250
other users then here is a social injury

677
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,630
engineering awareness campaign sit down

678
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,500
and watch this video for the next 20

679
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:25,300
minutes and with that in mind

680
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,980
incorporating that sort of data in the

681
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,409
process of a user getting enrolled into

682
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:32,080
an organization of hey what be previous

683
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,990
email addresses ok cool don't use any of

684
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,850
these any of these data sets and

685
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:40,510
probably don't use Ashley Madison using

686
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:42,429
your corporate account starts to sort of

687
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,500
communicate the whole acceptable use

688
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:47,330
policy in a little bit more detail than

689
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,800
a 50 page PDF

690
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:52,050
relying on things like ub keys or

691
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,250
two-factor authentication so is you know

692
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,440
that's going to be a parent parcel

693
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,790
business I think one of the things

694
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,730
that's always been a disconnect is

695
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:01,980
understanding the why and activities

696
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:03,780
such as the ones where you are

697
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,290
attempting to break in with some of

698
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:10,530
these password with existing breach data

699
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:12,389
is a it's an important part of that

700
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:15,809
process also relying on a single point

701
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:18,870
of or authentication as well whether

702
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:20,490
it's Roth Active Directory will also

703
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,809
help out because people are having to

704
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:25,590
maintain twenty or thirty different

705
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:27,840
passwords as I had about a year or two

706
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:31,320
ago someone's going to have a different

707
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,490
password that's sorry someone's still

708
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,960
going to maintain the exact same

709
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:37,950
password they've been using for the last

710
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,840
ten years as an organization being able

711
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:42,600
to understand where all your

712
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,879
applications are what the logins are how

713
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,570
they're authenticating and what those

714
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:51,360
represent from a risk standpoint and an

715
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,370
attack surface will also kind of help

716
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,790
with all right if there is another big

717
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:59,159
breach what will this mean for us

718
00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:04,020
we'll also kind of help prepare the

719
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:07,170
whole defensive piece other defensive

720
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:12,600
practices as well within breach data

721
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:14,400
things like like ensuring users aren't

722
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,730
using their corporate accounts signing

723
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,260
into the wrong apps showing that you

724
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,700
actually have proper filtering policies

725
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,890
out there so they're not access in the

726
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,500
wrong locations and then that being an

727
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:29,820
embarrassment to the the organization

728
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:33,360
because or your proxy IP addresses in a

729
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:35,399
site of ill repute and even how you

730
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,979
maintain information as well and

731
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,940
understanding what that means will also

732
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:45,600
that's just greatly in this process so

733
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,940
that's I guess a very quick overview of

734
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,590
of some of the stuff that my team and

735
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,200
I've been playing with from an offensive

736
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:53,669
standpoint and also how we've taken a

737
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,130
lot of that data and not just gone how

738
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:58,380
how we've owned you its employing this

739
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:02,810
information so that defenders can

740
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:06,750
and what the risks represent to them are

741
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:09,980
does anyone have any questions on any of

742
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,980
the things I've just talked about all

743
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:17,480
that weighs I've got the lights right of

744
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,480
me

745
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,039
yep awesome guys look thanks for for

746
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,400
attending and thanks for coming to base

747
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:30,590
off

748
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,590
[Applause]
