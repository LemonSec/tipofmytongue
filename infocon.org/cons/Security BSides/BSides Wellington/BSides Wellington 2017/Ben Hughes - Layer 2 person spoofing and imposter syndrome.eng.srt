1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,670
Avram this is really cool I had no idea

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,090
it was gonna be this big it seems the

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:17,619
entire island is here and you're both

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:19,750
came and it's really awesome to see the

5
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:22,750
beside organizers here putting on so

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,250
many talks about like health and

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,619
well-being in the industry because we're

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,939
really bad at it and that's never

9
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:33,400
affected anyone's life so clay layer 2

10
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:35,400
person sweeping an imposter syndrome Who

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,019
am I I'm a security engineer at stripe

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,519
Ouija payments we named after mag

13
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:41,260
stripes if you remember those because

14
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:45,339
pay wave has been here for a while now

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:48,750
and we still have mag stripes I used to

16
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:51,879
be at EDC so I know a lot about knitting

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,229
used to be a public lab so I'm probably

18
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:55,419
responsible for your infrastructure

19
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:56,799
breaking and I'm a two-time sponsor of

20
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,940
wrong island con if anyone's been to

21
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:02,530
Rock Island calm exactly yeah

22
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,798
by sponsoring me died paid and didn't go

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:08,400
I know how to pronounce router because

24
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,870
I've lived in this hemisphere so we can

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,490
I'm enjoying the latency of every

26
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:18,370
connection I'm in yeah and my Instagram

27
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,020
has been stuck advertising New Zealand

28
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,750
things for the past three or four months

29
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,580
I think because I tried to VPN to New

30
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,310
Zealand so I could try and get Google

31
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,530
Navigation settings to be in New Zealand

32
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,480
or Kiwi know if it's the same Australian

33
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,190
or Kiwi and then Instagram went oh you

34
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,880
live there let's do all your adverts on

35
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:41,610
this now so it's really useful to get

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,750
everyone on board this is a fact and

37
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:48,729
this is where I lose the crowd because

38
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:51,940
that's actually better than both so it's

39
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:55,090
like it's using a moments delicious it's

40
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,740
too sweet and too toffee like for me you

41
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,500
know but English Marmite is gross and

42
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,560
just goes egg and I do buy them in there

43
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,799
two and a half kilos tubs because I have

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,810
a problem but currently that's in sorry

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,739
but first before this train wreck of a

46
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:14,319
ride goes it's a trigger warning kiss

47
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:16,120
being responsible I don't know if this

48
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,399
show made it here but that's still my

49
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,980
favorite joke

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,150
this talks about vulnerabilities and I

51
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,640
don't know if anyone in the security

52
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,500
industry is heard of vulnerabilities I

53
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,059
haven't seen any talks on them or anyone

54
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,470
mentioning them but vulnerabilities are

55
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,030
the core quality or state of being

56
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,890
exposed to the possibility of being

57
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,200
attacked or harmed either physically or

58
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,828
emotionally and then some examples

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,849
whatever emotionally emotional

60
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:43,560
vulnerability is an emotional

61
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:45,510
vulnerabilities is never talked about in

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,299
the entire InfoSec world because you're

63
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,500
not allowed to have them but other

64
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,200
vulnerabilities you must talk about

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,849
because that way you prove your call

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,260
this talk is not about that if you are

67
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,720
looking the zero day you need to be in a

68
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,870
different room and finding an old

69
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,480
picture of Rochelle was really fun and

70
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,409
shows how old I am

71
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,920
yeah I don't have any RFC 486 one O'Day

72
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:15,739
if anyone knows what the RFC is you

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,738
should get out more so impostor syndrome

74
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,599
Vincente adult Minh is the best

75
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,859
character ever it's it's when high

76
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,560
achieving individuals are marked by

77
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:28,260
their in inability to internalize that

78
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,760
they're good at anything like they did

79
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,160
this thing but yeah anyone could do this

80
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,268
thing or I'm gonna get found out that I

81
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,418
actually didn't know as much as my

82
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,799
teammates or somehow I've passed in an

83
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,269
interview that has worked successfully

84
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,000
in this company for the past six years

85
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:46,409
but somehow I slipped through no issue

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,909
what that would be like and like I'm not

87
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:51,569
even qualified to give this talk and

88
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:53,608
this happens a lot

89
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:54,540
I've even turned down someone asked me

90
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:56,159
to go and speak about this in the

91
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,750
conference and I turned it down because

92
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,698
I didn't feel like I could talk about it

93
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,659
and I've spent the last few months going

94
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:03,479
I'm not sure I can talk about this

95
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:06,840
anymore and yet you see how many roses

96
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,250
builds and the theory that like everyone

97
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,079
has this not everyone is the most

98
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:14,639
confident outgoing sure of himself

99
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,799
person in the world but there's a

100
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,599
difference it's like when someone says

101
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,728
they have OCD when actually they mean

102
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:23,789
they like tidying putting all your pens

103
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:25,680
in a jar is not OC to eat well like

104
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,930
lining stuff on your desk is not OCD

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,760
going back to your house ten times to

106
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,210
check you lock to the door and having

107
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,500
the exact same routine every

108
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:37,120
because otherwise you have a panic

109
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:42,160
attack that's OCD so it's it's a the

110
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,750
difference of scale not to upset anyone

111
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,680
who has OCD you probably didn't make it

112
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:50,919
because you're checking you didn't leave

113
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:53,590
the gas on say an example I'm an example

114
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:57,460
from my own very life so I started at

115
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,710
EDC in 2013 this is the lowest

116
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,359
resolution photo when I saw the size of

117
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,229
this projection I'm like oh yeah that's

118
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,729
gonna work great back in 2013 we didn't

119
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:12,969
have digital cameras so this is scanned

120
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:15,008
off of a flash bulb so everyone this

121
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:19,060
photo has like spoken pretty much a

122
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:20,500
blackout or DEFCON I just coming in back

123
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,740
into you security after being in

124
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,259
operations for period most sleep well

125
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,669
entirely because I read the book kingpin

126
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,349
because my friend recommended it and I'm

127
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:30,460
like oh yeah I know these mailing lists

128
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:32,979
I know

129
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,330
although like what Iraq needs mailing

130
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,770
lists where everyone would post snort

131
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,039
signatures and you'd apply them and get

132
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,039
false positives

133
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:47,770
apologies anyone running snort still and

134
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,669
so we my first week there which is

135
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,430
already weird because you're editing

136
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,900
it's not a real place and we have a

137
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,919
first team meeting and everyone's going

138
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,690
in about all these projects they're

139
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,039
working on I obviously don't have a

140
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,560
project I've been working on because

141
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,400
I've been there three days and people

142
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,479
are talking like CSP and it's the only

143
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,609
one I remember and all these other

144
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,690
things I'm like crap I don't know any

145
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,219
JavaScript at all I've never like I

146
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,849
think I made a blink tag once is that

147
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:19,389
close like I have no idea any of this

148
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:20,590
other stuff and I'm like well I've got

149
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:22,300
so much to learn in my first few weeks

150
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:26,859
before these people just throw me out

151
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:29,880
the door and then like for the first at

152
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,690
least six months I was living under this

153
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,560
constant feeling that I was going to be

154
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:38,349
discovered and fired which is

155
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,699
extra-spicy if you're a migrant worker

156
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:41,469
in the US because if you lose your job

157
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,529
you lose your visa and you have to leave

158
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:46,019
the country pretty much that day

159
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:48,269
sometimes there's a grace period so like

160
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,159
being fired it's like oh I just have to

161
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:51,329
give up all my friends country then

162
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:55,319
return to another country and start

163
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:59,669
again no pressure this is really

164
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:02,399
horrible feeling I thought I'd make the

165
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:06,119
talk more polite by saying ducking and a

166
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,829
shout out to dark sake and this makes it

167
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:10,649
really hard to do good work because you

168
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:13,829
have this extra layer of anxiety and

169
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:15,089
fear and not wanting to fail so you

170
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:16,859
don't try anything risky and if you

171
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:19,139
don't try anything risky then your work

172
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:23,669
is kind of can become will feel really

173
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:28,579
mediocre so you kind of get like the

174
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:30,539
self-perpetuating loop feedback loop of

175
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:31,979
making your own stuff worse so it gets

176
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:35,579
harder which makes it worse that gets

177
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,469
harder which then leads to burnout which

178
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,939
I think some people are beginning to

179
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:42,419
acknowledge might happen in the security

180
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:44,429
industry HD used to be used to be named

181
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,948
the retirement home for burnt-out pen

182
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:50,628
testers and consultants because we had

183
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:53,729
so many like X AIESEC and other places

184
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:55,439
people who would just say yeah I'm bored

185
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:57,568
of going the same places doing the same

186
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,379
things every time and living in a hotel

187
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:00,689
for two weeks

188
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:03,509
can I just get a regular job at a place

189
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:09,299
yeah yeah come come along we have

190
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:13,019
knitting and cookies so what to do about

191
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:15,089
it it's just kind of why I'm talking and

192
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:16,979
also I love this but that like in

193
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:19,979
hindsight this isn't the best slide

194
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:25,409
because now like there's two CSO's two

195
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:27,659
managers son yes fine fine but I didn't

196
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:30,149
get fired from that place so by their

197
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:33,448
own reckoning I was over level to not

198
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:35,879
get fired so a lot of this is the

199
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:44,878
reality of yourself and the perception

200
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:47,550
of yourself you compare yourself against

201
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,649
the best of everyone in your in your

202
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,899
team and your peers to what you can do

203
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:54,389
rather than the average of what they can

204
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,470
do so like if you have some mind-blowing

205
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:57,700
reverse engineers on your team and

206
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,650
you'll never get a reverse engineering

207
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:04,870
or even forward engineering even like

208
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:07,090
they're much better reverse injure than

209
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,940
me I'm useless like so clearly I'm

210
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:13,360
useless yeah cool do they know how to

211
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,630
like do anything other than reverse

212
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,460
engineer no not really

213
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,990
right so you have all these other skills

214
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,670
but you only compare yourself to what

215
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:27,130
they do like which is just it's not fair

216
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,240
in yourself and you wouldn't if a friend

217
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,160
came to you with this problem you

218
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,510
wouldn't tell them no no that's right

219
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,569
yeah just compare yourself to the best

220
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,939
of everyone in your team against you

221
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,680
because that's a really clever thing to

222
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,800
do but your brain doesn't like working

223
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,800
like that so you have to have a much

224
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,900
more kind of leveled response to it of

225
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,729
okay so this person is good at this but

226
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,730
I'm much better at this because this is

227
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,860
what I do or if like me you're a jack of

228
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,340
all trades jack is probably a strong

229
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,540
word

230
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:00,580
master of absolutely nothing like I'm

231
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,290
not better than anyone in my team in

232
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:08,040
pretty much anything other than dyeing

233
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:08,040
my hair because rich I was awful at it

234
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:15,939
someone didn't get their deposit back on

235
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:18,250
their last place but as a whole I can do

236
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,230
a bunch of skills at once to various

237
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,270
levels that other people cannot do to

238
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:26,890
those levels hilariously due to being

239
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,990
older than 35 and working for a company

240
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,220
that does cloud I'm one of like four

241
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,010
people in the company who knows how to

242
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,640
rack things which is not the most

243
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:38,620
groundbreaking skill but it is when you

244
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,250
buy some service and people like yeah

245
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:46,080
there's a room there it's got fans and

246
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:48,400
 like yeah yeah they do

247
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,980
yeah you know what a great skill to

248
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,380
bring to the table and especially in

249
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,270
this delightful hemisphere you have a

250
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:59,080
tall poppy syndrome which is a great

251
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:01,300
thing to Google image search for which I

252
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,550
think can be as soon as anyone gets too

253
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,199
elevated you kindly peg them down but

254
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,240
that doesn't stop how you internalize it

255
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,180
and I don't think info cycle is

256
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,680
particularly good like

257
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,680
bringing the egos of certain people down

258
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:24,640
so now an exciting story with beautiful

259
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:27,640
clipart so when I was back at the puppet

260
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,899
labs in sunny Portland Oregon it's

261
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,029
working with the moon one of the

262
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:35,589
developers there they were one of the

263
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:37,209
first initial hires they've written

264
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:40,060
books on puppet they've done a lot of

265
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:41,649
the dev work and like dreaming up wild

266
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,229
ideas that we should never make it in

267
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:45,930
production but here it is for a demo

268
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:48,160
then eventually gets old

269
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,620
we were talking about OS provisioning

270
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,430
and he was like so how do these machines

271
00:11:50,620 --> 00:12:07,180
get the IPS on them they just use DHCP

272
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:09,699
what's DHCP wait nobody said I explained

273
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:13,540
DHCP wow that's really cool I'm like

274
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,010
wait so you have you know so much about

275
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,750
those things you can program at a write

276
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:21,790
like I can't read as quick as you can

277
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:24,279
write code and that's in Ruby so like

278
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,469
Hulu that's illuminating holy we

279
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:29,320
have different experiences we are good

280
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:35,440
at different things and this is the best

281
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:36,880
clipart on the Internet I could just

282
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,459
leave this light up for the whole thing

283
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,020
and it would be fine because it's so

284
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,880
good

285
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:46,420
but yeah having people from different

286
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,510
backgrounds and different experiences

287
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,270
and like how they were taught if you

288
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:54,630
have someone who came comes from like a

289
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,250
stranger a games development background

290
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,800
their versions of what optimized are

291
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,870
will be very different to yours if you

292
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,699
have someone who comes from say the

293
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,290
banking world their understanding of

294
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:14,170
privacy will either be much or worse

295
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:15,670
better than yours depending on anyway so

296
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,810
imposter syndrome could actually be a

297
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,520
sign that you're about to learn awesome

298
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,329
things and who doesn't like learning

299
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,620
awesome things they're awesome and

300
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:24,729
that's

301
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,350
it could be a sign that you have a lot

302
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,130
of knowledge to share too because if you

303
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:32,200
have things it's like I very rarely

304
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:34,689
found people who are a superset of all

305
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,430
my knowledge and experience and have

306
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,670
done everything I've done and I've only

307
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:43,089
done some of it I think that would be

308
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:45,699
creepy but also very unlikely and I

309
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:49,990
would be sorry for them as so much

310
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,850
drinking so now we have this audience

311
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,600
participation time scary I know how many

312
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,520
people have heard of someone getting

313
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,210
fired due to knowing absolutely nothing

314
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,160
I mean some hands but whatever how many

315
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:03,100
people have you heard of having impostor

316
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:08,469
syndrome to any degree more than more

317
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:11,430
than one hand right so using maths one

318
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:14,500
of those is bigger than the other

319
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:19,589
so using threat modeling and risk

320
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,589
analysis and machine learning

321
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:26,740
probably threat intelligence we can work

322
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,100
out that like one of them is more common

323
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:33,580
than the other Simpson maybe take that

324
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,990
into account so why do our brains make

325
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,290
this trade-off because human brains have

326
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,240
survived quite a while and they've had

327
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:43,839
bigger adversaries than the corporate

328
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:47,410
workplace such as I was going to say

329
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:51,339
dinosaurs but my education isn't that

330
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:53,050
bad despite living in America so some of

331
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:56,470
its ego I only know if you've heard of

332
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:58,740
this in the InfoSec space I think it's a

333
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:04,390
new thing they're trying to bring in

334
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:06,040
like new who he goes in InfoSec I'm just

335
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:09,730
like google image search is my favorite

336
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,550
thing of late this guy is a badass

337
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,110
hacker because generally when you're

338
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,990
using a computer holding a gun who's I'm

339
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:20,589
contagious because then you can type

340
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:22,680
with one hand and like use your nose to

341
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:27,420
press return

342
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:29,949
so in music actually has attackers

343
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,540
coders have bugs which often they feel

344
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,610
are attacking or project managers which

345
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,010
they often feel are attacking but no but

346
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,300
the same good operations people have the

347
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,569
entire world and a limited

348
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:43,810
live alcohol but these are not like

349
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:46,540
actually attacking you despite how I

350
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,660
don't know certain patch management

351
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,069
seems but in fistic there are real

352
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,990
people trying to break your trying

353
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:55,720
to break into stuff to steal things from

354
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,640
you in a criminal way like other than

355
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,000
like legal and risk ops and all those

356
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,339
other things have actual adversaries in

357
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,470
the traditional sense so it's actually

358
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:08,970
quite high stress in that regard

359
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:14,649
there's a very clear win lose stakes

360
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:16,209
like if you're Equifax you have lost if

361
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:24,910
you are a certain four-letter word

362
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:27,540
ride-sharing company moving on just 100k

363
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:30,760
bug bounty program brilliant

364
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,199
so as attackers you win and lose and

365
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,540
there's defenders you win and lose and

366
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,430
like it is very clear of over which

367
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,349
those are like if your site gets owned

368
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:40,510
and all your information is now on the

369
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,370
public Internet that's probably viewed

370
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:46,720
as losing and the attackers probably won

371
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:51,520
but if you pay them off and get them

372
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,510
sign an NDA it's good good especially in

373
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,930
the conferencing there's lots of

374
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:58,569
posturing because you have to like I

375
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,130
could I really wanted to include the bit

376
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,880
from Johnny mnemonic where he's like I

377
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:07,500
could crash your from here but why

378
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:11,530
give that film more credence and it has

379
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,720
and DEF CON still exists but there's a

380
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:18,540
lot of posturing at that of like being a

381
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:21,100
badass hacker being a a black hat

382
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,178
because wearing hats indoors like this

383
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:29,649
it's a social faux pas but okay I just

384
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:32,559
never understood that and the whole all

385
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,770
the talks they're like like adversarial

386
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,700
talks get much more interest than

387
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,889
defensive talks even though there's

388
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,190
probably more people defending in the

389
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,440
world then attacking one of them's

390
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,280
better paid if you're good at it 100k

391
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,280
bug bounty program

392
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,320
so it leads to people not showing the

393
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:59,120
vulnerabilities not that kinds we've

394
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,679
everyone can drop Oh day or why do

395
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,340
people not call it one day or two day

396
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,530
the day after like in reporting when

397
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,270
they said they use Oh day you're like

398
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,790
cool yeah but that was yesterday so now

399
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:14,920
it's one day it doesn't say Oh day

400
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:17,389
forever that's not how a day's work but

401
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,820
and people not admitting they don't know

402
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:23,450
anything out of fear out of worrying

403
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:28,689
about looking unknowledgeable dumb like

404
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:31,280
that like who you ask a question to some

405
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,950
the previous gunner holding badass

406
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,180
hacker like oh we don't know what that

407
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,650
means are you going to get a really

408
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,660
friendly answer or are you gonna get at

409
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,780
them laughing at you mm-hmm yeah

410
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:45,970
probably probably people burning out and

411
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:48,230
leaving the industry I know lots of

412
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:52,340
security people who really want to just

413
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:56,120
open a bar because it has to be less

414
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,820
stressful than working in defense and it

415
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,989
also leads to emphasize not being

416
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,490
diverse or inclusive in any way and I'm

417
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,100
really impressed at this conference for

418
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,200
being really diverse and inclusive so

419
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,550
good job New Zealand and carrying on

420
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:13,480
being really nice what are you the

421
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:20,960
Canada of the south

422
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:22,940
yes my friend Scott Roberts github has

423
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,070
written a much better blog post the mind

424
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,530
on this which is where I stole this

425
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:30,740
quote from and it's just about reframing

426
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:32,299
how you view it if you can go maybe I'm

427
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,390
not an impostor maybe I'm just not a

428
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:38,120
psychopath

429
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:43,790
which as any therapist will tell you is

430
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:47,090
step one on becoming a psychopath maybe

431
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:49,159
I'm just not paying enough and this is a

432
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:51,610
really nice thing to do which I imagine

433
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:55,250
not a lot of people in the industry do

434
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:56,959
but this is a really cool like trick you

435
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,799
can do for when you're having those days

436
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:06,640
where either your payload isn't popping

437
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:08,929
a shell or you work for Equifax or you

438
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,309
found another sort of github keys that

439
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:14,720
led to some mystery crowd never much and

440
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:18,370
another fun one like who enjoys

441
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,620
passwords and pass phrases there we go

442
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,850
but a friend of mine is like yeah I just

443
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,559
make them something that's really

444
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,889
uplifting so every time I have to type

445
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,178
in this really long passphrase I kind of

446
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,970
feel a bit better about the horrible

447
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:36,410
world like oh yeah that's like really

448
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:40,730
easy and would be really nice so no feel

449
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:43,040
terrible but like all this comes from

450
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,870
brains and brains are just a very

451
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,940
primitive set of ways of not being eaten

452
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,699
by things that slowly Vaughn evolved in

453
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:53,360
society into society so why why does

454
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:56,720
this happen and cognitive dissonance

455
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,030
that's really hard to say it's whether

456
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,700
the brain kind of holds two thoughts

457
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:03,980
that seemingly don't go together in this

458
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,140
way so like I've been having impostor

459
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:09,290
syndrome all my career that spanned two

460
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,230
decades then either there's really bad

461
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:15,770
hiring in the world which there is but

462
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:19,940
there's my point or like I'm able to do

463
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:21,980
this enough that it's okay and the only

464
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:25,130
other place I can actually think of this

465
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,050
ever happening is if anyone knows who

466
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,390
this is then

467
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:33,909
this is albert hofmann the person who

468
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:37,180
discovered acid with his cat he lived to

469
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:39,720
102 just by discovering acid than going

470
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:43,170
I wonder what this does

471
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,180
so the from accounts of which I've read

472
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:49,570
when taking our sage in like four hours

473
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,490
in you like that wool is melting your

474
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,710
leg and I am being surrounded by aliens

475
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,230
and it's not because of the acid it is

476
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,210
just a coincidence that they happen to

477
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,710
show up at this time because even though

478
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,260
I've taken acid it can be acid as this

479
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:05,560
is real I'm like there's similar levels

480
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,810
from what I've read of the cognitive

481
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,370
dissonance of I have done this thing and

482
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,960
here's the evidence but I am ignoring

483
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,979
the evidence because it can't be the

484
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,830
evidence or there are aliens every time

485
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:22,870
you take acid so what computers an

486
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:25,360
organization not microdose apparently

487
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,310
hoffman was my grossing for the last 20

488
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:33,510
years of his life and he died at a

489
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:33,510
hundred and two what a wonderful person

490
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,530
you've all these Silicon Valley startups

491
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,120
going yeah we're micro dosing you like

492
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:44,830
flavor this guy was doing at 101 years

493
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:46,590
old so as an organization or even as a

494
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:51,280
wonderful friendly conference

495
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:54,070
acknowledging it exists it's actually

496
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,190
like a reasonable first step telling you

497
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:59,500
new hires that it's okay to be unsure

498
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:01,210
and like as soon as you have someone on

499
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,950
your team go yeah none of this will make

500
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:07,420
sense I promise you eventually will make

501
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:09,070
less on sense but as think we have

502
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,310
complex systems that's why we are

503
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:15,040
working in a knowledge-based industry

504
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:17,290
that is very specialized because you

505
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,370
can't understand all the things because

506
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,899
there are so many things now on the

507
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,060
interact in so many ways so the idea of

508
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:28,750
knowing everything is just kind of

509
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:31,090
redonkulous the GDS in the UK have this

510
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:34,840
tiny list it's impossible to read even

511
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:39,070
on this giant projector but it's linked

512
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,110
in the I can say show notes it's linked

513
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:46,240
in the slides that all facts around

514
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:49,439
afterwards and this is my live in

515
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,360
America we still use facts what are you

516
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,340
and this is saying what it's okay to say

517
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,330
and it's okay to say I don't know and if

518
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:00,189
that is ingrained in your work culture

519
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:02,919
and that is welcome and that is on a

520
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,960
wall so it's clear it's not like a thing

521
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,980
said in back channels it's right there

522
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,920
in front of you and acknowledged by

523
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,420
everyone then that is a much easier way

524
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,070
of going I don't know and that's okay

525
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,510
rather than I don't know and I must

526
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,720
pretend otherwise I would be fired in

527
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:18,220
moments it's a recur Center formerly

528
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,790
hacker school but they changed the name

529
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,440
so be harder to remember who they are

530
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:27,879
they have a lot of social norms and

531
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,800
social rules and a giant projector there

532
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,240
no feigning surprise of like you don't

533
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,440
know something you must be that like

534
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,020
you're not allowed to do that well

535
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,310
you're encouraged not to do that there

536
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,370
because that doesn't actually help

537
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:41,850
anyone learn it just like is just gonna

538
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,719
say dick waving posturing unnecessarily

539
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:46,300
Jake waving

540
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,130
no well actually is which God if the

541
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,270
impose psyche unique you do that that'd

542
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,850
be great

543
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:56,260
no backseat driving and know subtle isms

544
00:24:51,850 --> 00:25:00,879
like racism sexism all those kind of

545
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:03,190
things if every security team in in tear

546
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,620
world could adopt these kind of social

547
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,850
rules I think in beside will be in a far

548
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,919
better place and they'll be much less

549
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:12,429
unhappiness burnout we'd actually be

550
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:14,070
able to work together occasionally might

551
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,540
become a bit more inclusive

552
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,850
[Music]

553
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,200
DEFCON might burn to the ground

554
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:24,610
guess I'm doing this talk at DEFCON next

555
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,080
year I say you say what could I have to

556
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,409
talk about blameless post-mortems that's

557
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,179
in my contracts and the idea is like if

558
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,530
something breaks you don't point your

559
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,060
fingers at the person who did the change

560
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,460
you talk to them go like what was your

561
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,379
expectation of the change you obviously

562
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:42,100
me their change going I think this will

563
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:43,990
work or you wouldn't have done it like

564
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,870
no one goes into acting oh yeah let's

565
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:49,310
see what I can break today

566
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:54,270
unless you're a red teamer

567
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:55,950
you are AFL select people go I actually

568
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,170
wanted to good at work and like let's

569
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:04,590
make a thing work push button flames

570
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:09,300
come out ah I didn't expect that you use

571
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:10,470
elasticsearch and that's like a much

572
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,240
nicer way of just having a blame fool

573
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,350
culture where like oh thing broke while

574
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,440
doing something really hard and

575
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:19,830
technical only they were working on in

576
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,450
really high-stress situation rather than

577
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,919
be supportive it and learn from this

578
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,020
let's point our finger of them and maybe

579
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:30,210
fire them like hmm I don't want to work

580
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:31,770
in that place because you won't learn in

581
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,810
that environment if every time something

582
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,670
breaks if every time a computer did

583
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:41,159
something wrong you got fired

584
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:46,650
who would boot their Mac who would

585
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:49,410
install Linux praising others I didn't

586
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:53,660
think I'd so many thing a thing we do in

587
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:56,040
InfoSec all that much which is a shame

588
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:59,160
stripe has a very strong culture of

589
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:06,240
being as supportive to each other as we

590
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:09,750
can across teams edge he had no Mis

591
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,370
that's the sad times as he had a very

592
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,320
positive culture towards each other and

593
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,389
like chat BOTS with plussing everyone

594
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,830
and being generally very supported to

595
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,550
each other and that's actually something

596
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:22,409
small but it actually makes a difference

597
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:26,159
I think at Yelp the person who gets the

598
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,780
most pluses every week gets I think it's

599
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,340
a unicorn for the week

600
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,990
a little plushie unicorn for the week

601
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,459
but that's just an acknowledgement that

602
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:36,240
like everyone really enjoyed your work

603
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,470
last week have a unicorn so we weren't

604
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,130
in life

605
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:42,300
tips for praising you like you can make

606
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,130
it personal to the person but don't

607
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,600
personalize it of same way you wouldn't

608
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,070
call someone a dumbass for breaking

609
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,139
something you didn't say you're a genius

610
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,270
for making something work it's like you

611
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,170
did something really good I'm like tell

612
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,520
me about how that worked

613
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,050
I'm really impressed by this rather than

614
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,300
you were obviously the second

615
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:59,690
incantation incarnation of Albert

616
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,690
Einstein

617
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:08,320
this is a contentious topic of the

618
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,889
concept of yak shaving my former

619
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:15,129
coworker

620
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:16,479
Seth Walker I just gonna say green the

621
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:19,178
yak shaving is to season it's

622
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,859
one-upmanship and it's like bro I

623
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:22,480
totally shave this giant yak and there

624
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:24,699
was lots of hair everywhere because it's

625
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,830
like there's that viewpoint or we work

626
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,629
in complex systems if we didn't we'd

627
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:32,470
probably be earning minimum wage you

628
00:28:28,629 --> 00:28:33,969
understand how pay structure works they

629
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,549
are complex systems and like they are

630
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:38,619
intertwined yes that's why we have 3000

631
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:40,899
servers it isn't just we like getting

632
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:43,199
AWS bills they all do something that

633
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:45,340
they all interact together like rice

634
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,470
unveiling one bit of code will reveal

635
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:50,439
other bits of code because your computer

636
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:53,710
doesn't run one bit of code anymore you

637
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,769
don't like to type 10 some stuff in

638
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,179
basic 20 some stuff in basic if you're

639
00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:03,429
running that as a web service I'd love

640
00:28:58,179 --> 00:29:05,769
to know although if anyone has any like

641
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:10,659
Atari basic code a that would be really

642
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:17,859
good I mean I guess probably again not

643
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:21,009
O'Dea like 3,000 day but where would

644
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:23,949
they get you in the headlines another

645
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:25,840
example was a bunch of years ago getting

646
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,269
my security team was going once with

647
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,418
another security team and two of their

648
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:33,489
security team were arguing over this

649
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:36,340
thing I'm being very vague in case they

650
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:38,710
ever watch this and one of them said

651
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,570
like well I I knew loads about this I

652
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,369
basically run a conference that's about

653
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,830
this and then kind of sat back kind of

654
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:46,629
quite what I've just won this round and

655
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:50,529
then the other person retorted with yeah

656
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:52,719
this is what I did my thesis on only

657
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:54,039
ever seems lovely it's at that point I

658
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,679
decided I never want to work with these

659
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:58,029
people ever again would not that I work

660
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:59,980
with him but I would never go and work

661
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:02,409
with them anywhere and I think a whole

662
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,720
team unilaterally agreed that while the

663
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:08,950
lunch was lovely

664
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:12,580
it's all about the people so don't be

665
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:15,340
those people your culture can affect

666
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:19,629
people in invisible ways

667
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:21,129
there is no convenient graph for people

668
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:23,679
who quit the industry because they were

669
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:26,080
burnt out or people who went to quit

670
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,230
doing info ii started doing like just

671
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,220
being in a developer or ops because they

672
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:36,880
found it a much friendlier environment i

673
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,799
think the the developments the

674
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:43,210
developers space is generally really

675
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:45,490
friendly you they're welcoming and they

676
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,530
they just love talking about the code

677
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,110
they've written or the language they're

678
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:52,480
into or the java frame jaw the script

679
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:56,350
framework of the week that is currently

680
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:59,039
being rewritten whereas like ops people

681
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:03,580
mostly Congaree talking about whiskey

682
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:05,289
and JVMs whereas similar sake people

683
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,908
would say well this group can talk to

684
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:08,950
this group and there are lots more tiny

685
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:13,120
islands and there seems to be much less

686
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:17,980
people talking across to each other and

687
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,928
that has implications just don't go too

688
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,260
far if you've heard of dunning-kruger

689
00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:25,299
it's the inverse of impostor syndrome

690
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:28,870
and is never worried about by the right

691
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:31,120
people the people who are like no no I

692
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:32,739
totally know what I'm doing and I'm

693
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,168
brilliant at everything and I won't let

694
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,270
you do anything like yeah I'm just gonna

695
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:40,270
go and look at whatever local job

696
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:43,658
hunting website people use I I can't

697
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:45,460
remember I think anyone who's attending

698
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:46,210
a talkin impostor syndrome probably

699
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,000
doesn't need to worry about

700
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,830
dunning-kruger and if you do I'm more

701
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,669
than happy for that mistake to have be

702
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:59,399
made on the off chance I realized

703
00:31:54,669 --> 00:32:03,760
lunches after this so I will be rapid

704
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:09,210
because everyone wants to eat being just

705
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,210
understand be be understands to people

706
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:20,970
firing my editor stand under people like

707
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,970
a B this is hard

708
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,080
be kind to yourself even if you're

709
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,090
drugged like me so self-care is not

710
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,730
really a thing this industry is famed

711
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:36,760
for like hope high-profile deaths due to

712
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:40,630
opioids is not self-care attending Vegas

713
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:45,400
in summer is not self-care doing the

714
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:47,980
Vegas and seek help there are super

715
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,740
friendly people in the industry they're

716
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:53,260
probably quite busy being friendly to

717
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:55,480
people like therapy is a real thing I'm

718
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,820
English and I talk to a therapist

719
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,930
this isn't like not an anomaly it can

720
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:04,060
happen even like yeah uptight English

721
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,820
people occasionally can realize maybe I

722
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,530
could talk to other people about things

723
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:15,300
rather than just bottling it all up and

724
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:15,300
becoming in u.s. postal worker too soon

725
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:23,070
really in America's history and this

726
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,570
like affects people differently

727
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:29,669
confidence or having a narrow competence

728
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:29,669
often comes with having privilege if you

729
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,910
like if you're a migrant worker you you

730
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:38,680
lose your job and get fired you are not

731
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,840
quite gonna be quite as confident as oh

732
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,630
if I lose my job I can just go back to

733
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:46,030
my large trust funds that my parents

734
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,680
gave me like oh yeah no you're gonna be

735
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,960
more confident because you have a lot

736
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,790
less to lose why are you even having a

737
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,110
job I hate you Nathaniel

738
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:59,800
etc arrogance also comes with privilege

739
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:00,729
for the above kind of reasons so you

740
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:07,090
know just don't work with those people

741
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:11,230
simple as I said yeah I'm just gonna

742
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:15,880
tweet the link to speaker deck which I

743
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:18,760
keep spelling wrong there's a bunch of

744
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:22,110
actual resources on this the Scots blog

745
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,350
post which is better than my blog post I

746
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,350
would say that

747
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,049
and then blue hackers which is an

748
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,520
organization on mental health in the

749
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,099
tech community which is very tied into

750
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,949
the delightful effects of impostor

751
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:38,200
syndrome if that sounds like an

752
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:42,089
environment you'd like to work in come

753
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:47,549
talk to me about jobs at stripe isn't

754
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:52,498
and thank you

755
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:52,499
[Applause]
