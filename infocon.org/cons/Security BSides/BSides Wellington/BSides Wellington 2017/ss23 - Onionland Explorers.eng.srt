1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,879
okay so first of all now I feel bad

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,650
about how bad my slides were the guy in

3
00:00:08,879 --> 00:00:12,360
the last room had these amazing had

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,009
written slides that were like perfected

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,610
so I've tried to do my best but I just

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,860
handwriting some slides pretty amazing

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:24,599
as you'll see so I am talking about the

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:27,419
tour today as you might realize and tour

9
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,689
and it's two modes of operation so had a

10
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:32,759
good one here hands up if you have used

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,170
tour to access the internet like get

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,000
around a block at university school

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,100
something like that yep quite a few

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,880
people hands up if you have brought

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,860
illegal drugs on tour there's always one

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,910
there's always one ok so you've all

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,610
passed the first challenge also I'm

18
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,790
assistant e3 as mentioned also go by

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,070
Steven sometimes so before we start

20
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,890
we'll talk about how tour works it's

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,780
important to understand that so here we

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,880
are his autograph got our talk-line here

23
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,430
this is what runs on the end-users

24
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,240
computer it will talk to this first guy

25
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,409
here who is contributed bandwidth you

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,939
know this is one of the relays that you

27
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,710
can run yourself you could be this first

28
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,460
guy here and you'll encrypt a message

29
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,469
that goes to him then you'll pick

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,208
another guy and you'll send a message

31
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:23,369
this guy and say hey talk to this guy

32
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,569
and then that'll go across there and you

33
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,600
do the same with this one here and

34
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:29,600
because this is layer encryption onions

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,309
right that's where the name comes from

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,288
this guy here knows who you are but not

37
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,579
we are going this guy here knows neither

38
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:37,859
who you are or where you're going and

39
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,630
this guy here only knows where you're

40
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:40,889
going and not who you are and that's the

41
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,469
core of when you're accessing the

42
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:45,539
cleaner how the anonymity works that no

43
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:49,678
one person has enough information to D

44
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:51,810
anonymize you this here is another slide

45
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:53,490
that shows it it's pretty simple it's

46
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,439
got some more green arrows it's on here

47
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,408
even more simple so you get the idea

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,839
tor is pretty simple hidden services not

49
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,789
so much this one has much more arrows

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,729
and each of these little arrows here is

51
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:07,529
an entire one of these things and then

52
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,300
here's another one and this one has

53
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:10,560
literal pictures of onions on it you

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,780
know it's getting complicated

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,430
this one here has three different parts

56
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,220
to it this one here has like eight and

57
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,720
oh no oh no hidden services they're

58
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,060
pretty complicated

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,950
so we will briefly go over how it works

60
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,560
the hidden server

61
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,599
there he is Silk Road he's always Silk

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,269
Road he talks to the directory service

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,000
and says hey I'm Silk Road if anyone

64
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,010
wants to find me go to this dude here

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,110
and then the client goes hey I want to

66
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,328
go to Silk Road to buy some drugs and it

67
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,739
goes hey talk to him here and then you

68
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:42,900
talk to this guy and you're like I'm

69
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,280
gonna make Silk Road here and then so

70
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,209
grow here's that you talk to him and he

71
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,310
goes meet you there

72
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,590
long story short you get to talk to Silk

73
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,709
Road and each of these connections is

74
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,720
also anonymized so once again you can

75
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,609
talk to Silk Road Silk Road doesn't know

76
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,769
who you are and you don't know who Silk

77
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,799
were toes and that's how the onion

78
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,510
services work it lets you host a website

79
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:05,099
reasonably resilient Li that people

80
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,590
can't take down they don't know where it

81
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,000
is who's hosting at anything like that

82
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,680
but of course as per you might have

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,750
imagined there are some flaws with this

84
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:17,609
idea like this can happen so what are we

85
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,650
gonna go over gonna go over some attacks

86
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:21,870
on the protocol that tor is not designed

87
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,730
to protect against it's really important

88
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,440
to understand what tor is going to do

89
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,149
for you when it's not we're gonna go

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,470
over some things that it is designed to

91
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,690
predict against but maybe doesn't do as

92
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,299
well as it could some attacks on the Tor

93
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,620
software itself some of the in user

94
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:37,109
client software like the tor browser

95
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,450
bundle attacks on end users being idiots

96
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:40,950
and ones oh it's fun and lastly we'll go

97
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,810
over some of the end-user server

98
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,629
software side of things like a onions

99
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,239
game so Street modeling everyone's

100
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:49,888
favorite topic it's really important to

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,599
understand the Tor threat model and how

102
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:55,019
it doesn't protect you from a global

103
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,349
passive adversary so if you are trying

104
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,329
to hide yourself from the NSA or someone

105
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:01,470
powerful like that and of course the

106
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:03,780
eunice it's not a true global passive

107
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,489
adversary but they're pretty close you

108
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,519
can have a bad time these guys right

109
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:13,139
here these people not having a good time

110
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,060
would not recommend that so if a global

111
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,220
person ever Siri is trying to attack you

112
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,139
and you were using tor you may be DN

113
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,549
Onam eyes but not necessarily decrypted

114
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,440
and of course this does rely on

115
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:24,479
monitoring the right traffic but the

116
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,740
three model itself does not protect a

117
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,599
global against a global passive

118
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,159
adversary there are certain steps you

119
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:31,320
can take to help it's not really going

120
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:32,099
to help you so don't make an enemy of

121
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,159
the NSA

122
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,710
it's not gonna work out well protocol

123
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,320
the tax this is a great little paper

124
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,539
here which I think was one of the first

125
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,010
papers that really talked about hidden

126
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,530
services and some of their issues is

127
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:49,860
very very old now and before tour was

128
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:52,049
really in use much and this was how you

129
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,570
could do you naanum eyes those hidden

130
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,990
services so as we can see here we have

131
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:02,280
our client who is also a relay and he's

132
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:04,860
running BSD as hackers do and the key

133
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,479
point here is that if those three nodes

134
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,940
that we talked about if they have chosen

135
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,520
equally from the entire pool of nodes

136
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,100
and you run a node all you need to do is

137
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,630
do 100 connections a thousand

138
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,150
connections 10,000 connections and

139
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,550
eventually you'll be picked as that

140
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:24,030
number one node right and so you can do

141
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:26,460
traffic confirmation where you access

142
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,309
Silk Road and you send through a 50 byte

143
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,500
packet and then you see a 55 packet come

144
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,700
through on your tour relay you say okay

145
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,530
that could have been out you do it again

146
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,599
and eventually you can get to the point

147
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,729
where you can say okay someone is - I'm

148
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,770
talking to Silk Road over this tour

149
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,870
relay and then you can work out with

150
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,210
your one two or three just based on am I

151
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,760
talking to the rendezvous point I know

152
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,919
that am I talking to two tall servers I

153
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,110
know that or am I talking to one tor

154
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,090
server and another IP address away I

155
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,520
don't know BAM you're now the anonymous

156
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,380
little bro so this is kind of we're a

157
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,810
lot of their hidden services attacks

158
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:05,130
have been going over the last 10 years

159
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:07,230
or whatnot so they came up with a way to

160
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,440
prevent it of course and this is the

161
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,910
entry guard nodes so this has two ways

162
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,140
it works first of all it's an exclusive

163
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:18,300
club that only the cool nodes can join

164
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,710
so if you do not meet the cool criteria

165
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,770
you are not gonna be able to hack any

166
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:25,010
one buddy that means you have to have

167
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,120
high bandwidth you have to be stable

168
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,980
people can't know you're hacking them

169
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,220
the Tor project don't like that they

170
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,870
they show you out pretty quick but you

171
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,760
can be in that Club and the second

172
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,460
prediction here is that once Silk Road

173
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,930
picks a set of entry guards it will

174
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,940
maintain that for a very long period

175
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,470
because of course even if you were in

176
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,990
that Club if you weren't picked right

177
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,850
away and you had to wait six months

178
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,820
your next attempt and it's still only a

179
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,930
one in a hundred thousand chance it's

180
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,640
really hard to carry out these attacks

181
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:58,290
right so that's kind of the two ways

182
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,909
that this can't be done but of course if

183
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,160
the club isn't exclusive enough enough

184
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,110
you can get into it and you can just

185
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,210
kill or rather DDoS everyone in the club

186
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,130
and then Silk Road has to choose to

187
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,020
either go down or pick some you guard

188
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:13,159
nodes and hey you might just run a lot

189
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:15,510
of guard nodes so the kind of end result

190
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,630
right now is if someone has a lot of

191
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,490
money they can probably do your naanum

192
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,200
eyes your hidden server and you see this

193
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,690
occasionally some of the darknet markets

194
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,070
the smart ones will be like hey we've

195
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,080
noticed a bunch of people attacking us

196
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,330
they haven't even on alized us but they

197
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,310
think they think the we think they might

198
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,870
we're gonna stop running for a while and

199
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,160
if you were looking for this kind of

200
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,260
attack you could see it pretty clearly

201
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,940
right you'd see a lot of kind of relay

202
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,380
attacks going on and you'd be like okay

203
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,180
someone's tried to do naanum eyes me

204
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:46,590
maybe we should ease off the drugs for a

205
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:49,440
bit so someone did carry out this kind

206
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,299
of attack on the Tor network live there

207
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,690
was a talk pulled from blackhat back in

208
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,400
2014 it was basically talking about this

209
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,469
kind of thing I'm not proceeding in you

210
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,289
attacks here sorry anyone who wants to

211
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,700
find some but these guys did and they

212
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,110
had some fancy ways of doing their

213
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,969
traffic confirmation kind of like in

214
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,070
circuit and some other things that made

215
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,270
this attack a lot more viable talk about

216
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,830
pulled so we don't actually know all of

217
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,419
the content but we did see the attack

218
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,729
happen on the Tor network which gives us

219
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,260
more data and then when everyone was

220
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,810
like hey if CMU did you guys do this

221
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,190
they said no wasn't our soil we don't

222
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,180
know what's happening and then finally

223
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,350
someone was like you got paid for

224
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,690
selling the exploit and they were like

225
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,490
we didn't not get paid for that so I was

226
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,420
like oh really that was that was the

227
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,700
problem

228
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,770
so of course some people out there are

229
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,640
trying to DN on almost all servers and

230
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:37,289
they have lots of money and connections

231
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,620
but Tory is working hard to prevent

232
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,780
these kind of attacks so proposal 2 4 7

233
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,670
sounds really fancy defending against

234
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,110
gar discovery attacks using Vanguard's

235
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,030
if gods aren't enough we'll have

236
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,130
Vanguard's so they basically put more

237
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,600
guards ahead of your guards but I kind

238
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,370
of like guards and the idea is now you

239
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,380
have a tiered selection of guards where

240
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,020
each guard is like guiding the other

241
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,180
guards and then so before where it was

242
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,100
like you had it

243
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,079
one God all these gods on gods and gods

244
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,430
you need to attack anyway that's really

245
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,850
good it's kind of like exponentially

246
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:09,380
increases the cost of the attack and I

247
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,750
mean I'm not a cryptographer but it

248
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,730
looks pretty good to me so this is being

249
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,430
looked at being implemented and I think

250
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,720
it goes through it'll be good but at the

251
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,680
moment there's kind of that weakness

252
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,850
yeah

253
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,339
there's also been a bunch of changes

254
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,950
lately around the next gene hidden

255
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,690
services but this is more of kind of

256
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,160
like a cleanup you might have seen

257
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,410
they now have longer names that's

258
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,630
because they're using more crypto

259
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,430
they're switching from RSA to elliptic

260
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,900
curve cryptography that kind of thing so

261
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,550
they are making changes all the time to

262
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,550
make these things more secure better

263
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,860
attacks on the Tor Damon can have a bad

264
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,500
time buddy this is the CVE search from a

265
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,510
little while ago there b8c the ease on

266
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,520
the Tor Damon over the life of it that's

267
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,040
that's very long number for those who

268
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,630
know about see des so good luck with

269
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,760
that if you find something great but I

270
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,380
just don't think it's very likely

271
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,120
contrast that to text from the tor

272
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,100
browser bundle for those who know

273
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Firefox it's gonna be a little bit more

274
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,680
fruitful 1468 there was like I got the

275
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,690
screenshot like six months ago it's

276
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,430
probably doubled by now tripled I don't

277
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,910
know I wouldn't want to be running

278
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,199
Firefox so that's that's where a lot

279
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:22,730
more of these kind of non protocol

280
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,770
attacks happen sad and it is the most

281
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,010
common attack people care about we saw

282
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:31,699
when the FBI had a kilometer coordinated

283
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:33,260
takedown of freedom hosting which was

284
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,530
kind of the biggest tool hoster at the

285
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,240
time they hosted anything so a bunch of

286
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,670
sites that weren't dodgy but a bunch

287
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,930
that were horrific like child abuse and

288
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,360
anything else you'd imagine that's bad

289
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,189
freedom hosting which doing it FBI took

290
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,500
it down and what that is they put

291
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,240
JavaScript on every page that was hosted

292
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,130
on freedom hosting and D anonymized any

293
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,870
user so it had some collateral damage

294
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,520
right because if you were just hosting a

295
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,150
blog there while you've also been doin

296
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,439
onna mised

297
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:02,240
but you know point is that they can they

298
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,490
can use these attacks on people and they

299
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,470
do they take someone down put this

300
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,270
JavaScript then so what are the

301
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,000
mitigations you could migrate to a

302
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,949
secure browser chrome though that has

303
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,230
its own issues I would not recommend

304
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,210
that but if someone invests at the time

305
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,100
you could do it you could rewrite

306
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,140
Firefox in a memory safe language which

307
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,640
I used to think was a hilarious joke

308
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,080
that someone would do that but I see

309
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,630
Firefox is doing it now they're

310
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,080
rewriting in rust so I'm not so sure

311
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,180
anymore

312
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,620
and so yeah it's been talking about

313
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,150
briefly it's a huge undertaking but I

314
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,500
guess they're doing it so that will

315
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,780
hopefully help if you using a memory

316
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,300
safe language maybe Firefox would be a

317
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,640
little bit better now alternate earth

318
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,260
mitigation is use no script like if you

319
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,580
go to buy drugs and someone's like hey

320
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,990
do you wanna turn on JavaScript for

321
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,420
these drugs we have like great pop-ups

322
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,370
and like we do the JavaScript friendly

323
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,280
the staff will recite don't do it it's a

324
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:55,790
trap definitely recommend using no

325
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:58,520
script attacks on end-user

326
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,780
idiocy so these are the funny people

327
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,390
like what if you don't want to be in an

328
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,040
exam and so you just you just send a

329
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:07,160
bomb threat right but you do it have a

330
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,990
toy so you don't get caught and then you

331
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,490
get out of your exams and the FBI comes

332
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,110
because they don't like bomb threats it

333
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,420
turns out they're pretty pretty against

334
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,710
them and then the administrator of the

335
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,420
school I just look into the logs right

336
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,100
and they're like who was using tor at

337
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,349
the time of the bomb threat oh it was

338
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,410
that one guy in that dorm we might go

339
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,990
have a talk with them so you can't just

340
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,760
use tor and be like I'm anonymous no one

341
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,890
can find me doesn't quite work like that

342
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,680
right you stick out pretty bad while

343
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,960
using it now the mitigation here is dawn

344
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,670
crack under interrogation because just

345
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,530
using tor alone isn't enough to get you

346
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,000
put in prison but this guy got

347
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,380
interviewed by the FBI came not gonna

348
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,750
distort did you do that and he was like

349
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,320
yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry what have I

350
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:52,850
done so don't don't talk to the police

351
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,170
man gonna get caught yeah okay now we

352
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,000
are into the fun stuff I hope I'm not

353
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,400
going too fast or too slow

354
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,010
who cares about Firefox exploits

355
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,390
speaking pop Apache and PHP man users

356
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:05,770
who cares about their when a pop Silk

357
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:07,189
Road and so we got some demos for you

358
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,170
yeah ooh yeah

359
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,810
xxx demo time so we can be looking at

360
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:14,060
onion scan so this was some sweet

361
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:17,930
software written by someone called Sarah

362
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:20,410
oh no Twitter notifications I really

363
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:23,120
thought they wouldn't happen this time I

364
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:26,449
don't even have the Twitter tab open and

365
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:31,490
it's still happening okay

366
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:33,740
hang on I can't live okay we're going at

367
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,889
this window here just connect dude let's

368
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:41,600
hope my internet is still working so

369
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:43,279
we're gonna start off we are going to

370
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,670
start off with running onions gang

371
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,839
because it takes a little while I think

372
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,930
okay so I've got the hostname there I've

373
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,389
got onions game running C URL onion scan

374
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,279
scans onions finely enough and it tries

375
00:13:53,389 --> 00:14:01,820
to find issues with their security

376
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:03,560
so this Oh give me give me one second

377
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:08,170
here

378
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,170
can I just this is not easy

379
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:17,089
thinking why the code of conduct

380
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:21,170
violation that I hand soon okay so I did

381
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:23,750
I did add get install Apache apt-get

382
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:26,360
install tour and configured tor to

383
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,010
listen to this website so here's the

384
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,779
website it's you could go to the snap if

385
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,269
you want to I it's just the default

386
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,470
Apache page nothing right if you

387
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,300
installed Apache out-of-the-box it's

388
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,410
gonna be secure is what you might think

389
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:42,319
that you might be wrong if you go to

390
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:45,939
slash server status as you might expect

391
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,339
forbidden you don't have a mission sorry

392
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,260
but I in a sense engine scanner still

393
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:52,850
going we will leave that finish but if

394
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,230
we go to here this is the tour page if

395
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,730
you've never used it before that's what

396
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,040
comes up when you open tour it's like

397
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,260
yay tor protecting people yay it's

398
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,170
pretty good and it's like oh yeah you're

399
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,120
gonna get hex bro don't worry about that

400
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:07,729
anyway yeah yeah here's the same site so

401
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:14,029
I sort of tour exact same thing except

402
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:20,630
now I won't get distracted I won't get

403
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:22,490
distracted here we are now you might be

404
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:26,360
wondering what on earth is haven't here

405
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:29,470
and you might be super sleuth and

406
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,209
realize that it's all like 127.0.0.1

407
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:35,060
because well tor is talking to apache /

408
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:36,739
localhost and apache is taught if you're

409
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,630
connecting to me over the local address

410
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,100
you are clearly trusted you are on the

411
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,589
system you'll find

412
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,019
it's not the case so the information

413
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:47,690
exposed by a default server status page

414
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:50,449
out of the box is enough to really cause

415
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,149
havoc these are just what happens when

416
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,500
you run a server on the Internet right

417
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,540
but there's often a lot of information

418
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,790
in here enough that you can be

419
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,620
completely dead on the most and if you

420
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,870
had any other status pages if you ever

421
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,550
had something like an admin panel there

422
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,019
just is like oh your localhost you'll

423
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,930
pretty be okay you're gonna be screwed

424
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:12,589
here as well so it's kind of one of the

425
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,579
weird interactions between tor and the

426
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:16,100
other stuff so here we are

427
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:19,399
onion scan ran I checked a lot of stuff

428
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:22,610
it checks for things like images have

429
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:25,279
icons in Eclair ticks links it's SH keys

430
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,319
anything you can use to link together

431
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,399
different services or do you naanum eyes

432
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,719
you it's going to search for that so

433
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,000
really great tool if your inches and the

434
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,269
stuff and it covers most the basic stuff

435
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,230
so if you do run document market check

436
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:43,339
out onion scan yeah why this is bad it's

437
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:47,420
very bad I'll just quickly show you the

438
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:49,759
toy config so you can see what's kind of

439
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:53,360
happening where are we do is that

440
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:56,660
readable it's not readable is it it's

441
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,110
okay hang on one second

442
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,110
I will

443
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:08,149
it's somewhere here there's a heavy font

444
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:11,569
yeah you can tell them a pro at doing

445
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:16,670
talks right 48 they'll be big enough why

446
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:18,260
oh geez somewhere here here we are

447
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,060
hidden service that you actually can't

448
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,650
see it hidden service do all they've

449
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,359
done in the default config is I'm coming

450
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,670
down this line and the slide this

451
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,260
connects back on port 80 to yourself and

452
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,440
set up a directory for storing that

453
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,940
stuff so that is onion scan that is a

454
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,020
tool you can use to make sure you are

455
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,570
not going to be hacked if you are

456
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,860
running dodgy websites okay we're gonna

457
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:40,909
go back into presentation mode where the

458
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:45,709
notifications will go away

459
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:47,960
I really hope at least look at that

460
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,480
they're gone hahaha

461
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,030
okay so that was Lincoln scan I heard

462
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,800
there helps check it out she does like a

463
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,320
bunch of other research one of the

464
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,120
things she does is quantifying exactly

465
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,600
how many sites there are which kinds on

466
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,159
the Internet

467
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,870
if you ever thought of yourself like oh

468
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,360
honey I've seen a sites on the dark near

469
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,979
edges the most horrible atrocious web

470
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,570
sites they mainly know they're mainly

471
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,850
just dodgy people doing dodgy things

472
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,470
that aren't quite that dodgy she's

473
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,419
quantified a lot of that and kind of

474
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,580
done some stuff there's another weakness

475
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,110
in how hidden services work at the

476
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,240
moment that you can actually kind of

477
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,990
enumerate them with enough time you can

478
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,280
list every site hosted on tour they're

479
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,290
kind of fixing there I think you can't

480
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,210
even do it right now but it was for a

481
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:32,379
long time that so you could quantify it

482
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,880
exactly what percentage asides a dodgy

483
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:39,350
hey yeah it's a default install of

484
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,580
Apache it's localhost format you've got

485
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,929
to be aware of that stuff when you're

486
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,669
running a side especially if you take

487
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,110
off the shelf software right like Apache

488
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:48,800
you would think it'd be secure it's

489
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:51,620
actually not the reasons now Silk Road

490
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:55,100
had some other stuff going on here right

491
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:57,530
like one of the core issues is that if

492
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,350
you have unsecure software on your

493
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:02,210
server which spoiler alert you totally

494
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:04,550
do and someone hacks it and they can

495
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:07,550
just go curl what is my IP com

496
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,940
like that's a really horrible situation

497
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,000
to be in

498
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,430
so Silk Road this is a reddit thread

499
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,930
where someone logged in and they saw

500
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,590
just a massive amount of debugging

501
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,600
information

502
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,730
on the front page including clear text

503
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,779
IP addresses and for those who don't

504
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,299
know that's because Dread Pirate Roberts

505
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:24,529
was like a really good PHP developer who

506
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:25,908
did everything in production there's

507
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:29,450
just like Vlad umph there yeah I'll see

508
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:30,559
what what that is and it had a bunch of

509
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:35,960
stuff that could have been used to D

510
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,918
anonymize so you know like that's kind

511
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,460
of what's going to happen someone's

512
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:40,520
going to leak some information

513
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,200
eventually but you need to stop putting

514
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,740
your hidden services on the public

515
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,450
Internet

516
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,220
they don't need public Internet access

517
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,669
all they need a sax is taught that it's

518
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:51,860
it the other problem here is that if you

519
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:53,870
have three different hidden services or

520
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,389
even just one server serving some hidden

521
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,340
services and some not you can you can do

522
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,809
things like SSH keys timestamps you can

523
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,039
correlate those and just be like I'm

524
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:03,139
pretty sure it's Greg from down the road

525
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,320
so you get the exact same timestamp down

526
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,270
to the nanosecond things like that these

527
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,789
are two things you can do to stop these

528
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:14,120
kind of attacks happening now

529
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:17,539
I made freedom host do you get it it's

530
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:20,959
like freedom hosting but it's dumb

531
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:23,750
so that's free dumb host so it's a set

532
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,360
of tools for hosting company platform

533
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,250
infrastructure it's based on the grukk's

534
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:31,039
portal of Pi which was also don't know

535
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,620
there is basically same kind of idea if

536
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,029
you want to access tor and you don't

537
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,620
want to get hacked you can set up a

538
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:38,720
little raspberry pi that X is a tor

539
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,189
router plug that into your computer and

540
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,659
turn off the Wi-Fi and everything and

541
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,549
now you're guaranteed to be going

542
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:45,649
through tor even if someone did one of

543
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:47,059
those Firefox exploits on you it doesn't

544
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:49,100
matter because that computer could be

545
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,510
completely owned it still can't get past

546
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,100
the raspberry pi that's acting kind of

547
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,010
like a firewall here they'd have to have

548
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,709
like a Linux remote exploit or an

549
00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:00,049
exploit in the tour daemon itself which

550
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,190
it doesn't seem particularly likely so

551
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:03,770
this is one way to prevent that

552
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:05,000
happening and this is kind of how our

553
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,918
freedom host came about

554
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,750
it doesn't require anyone to trust the

555
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,690
service because if you're signing up for

556
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:14,029
a host on the internet and it's free you

557
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,679
just be like give me one and freedom

558
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:17,559
host is just gonna be like sure buddy I

559
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,299
don't have anything to verify you with

560
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:22,340
so then you get a virtual machine right

561
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:23,809
you log into that you don't need a trust

562
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,879
the person who's hosting the verge

563
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:28,070
machine because they can't know who you

564
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,710
are there is no way for them to know who

565
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,779
you are and

566
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:35,870
that's how freedom hosting works and of

567
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:37,850
course because I am very smart I ran

568
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,459
this in the real world as I said it was

569
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:43,340
free and I just gave anyone on tour a

570
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,159
free virtual machine and I'm not a

571
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,928
lawyer but I think if you do it for free

572
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,470
and you say it's research like they let

573
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:55,039
you off so uh I think I'm okay but I did

574
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:59,080
it anyway oh let's skip over that one

575
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:02,899
because I didn't take that out clearly

576
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,610
so how did it go right I had two people

577
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:06,889
emailing me whenever the service went

578
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:08,809
down so if you think like normal people

579
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:12,408
are bad tour users they can be quite bad

580
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:15,830
as well just down I know I unplugged it

581
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:17,539
it's down there were multiple political

582
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,279
and informational blogs and this is one

583
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:21,408
of the really interesting things for me

584
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,389
is that they were just people wanting to

585
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:25,879
put out like weird opinions out there

586
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:27,439
people just wanted to have a place where

587
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:29,119
they can host some website especially

588
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,379
for free because even on the clean it

589
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,769
like getting a free website is kind of

590
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:33,110
hard

591
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:35,240
so there was that kind of thing it's an

592
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,850
ITB proxy service so ICP is another

593
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,080
anonymization network thing and i'm

594
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,908
guessing this was someone who wanted to

595
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,439
like use my bandwidth to contribute to

596
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:43,850
their network which is fine like I'm all

597
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,590
for that and I think it's like a really

598
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,600
interesting use of kind of free services

599
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,439
it's like promoting more anonymity and

600
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,139
stuff

601
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,580
there was one likes in Bitcoin received

602
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:54,799
child pornography site it was like

603
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,539
purely text but I can see all that

604
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,940
because I run the virtual machines so I

605
00:22:56,539 --> 00:23:00,919
immediately delete it so like it's

606
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,230
really interesting because what do you

607
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,690
think of when you think give anyone on

608
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,590
tour a free virtual machine like if

609
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,269
you're anything like me you probably

610
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,490
thought like hell Nora that is gonna

611
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:12,230
work out really bad and it actually

612
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,720
works out ok at least for the amount of

613
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:17,720
time I did it so I would totally

614
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,100
recommend that you have think at least

615
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,980
about doing this if you have something

616
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,939
to contribute bandwidth servers maybe

617
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,440
you should look at doing something with

618
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,450
us and getting a first-hand experience

619
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,600
of what's actually on tour and why you

620
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:31,249
might support it that kind of thing so I

621
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,600
will briefly go over the architecture

622
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:34,490
yeah

623
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,769
physical raspberry pie once again you

624
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,690
could replace this with any server I had

625
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:40,519
so many issues with just like running

626
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,770
tor on a Raspberry Pi turns oh those

627
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:45,679
aren't powerful who knew

628
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,309
so that was a cause of frustration for

629
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,220
me

630
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:50,870
each Raspberry Pi just runs toward Amon

631
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,549
and configuration management it's all it

632
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,229
runs each virtual machines in its own

633
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:58,908
VLAN that can never talk to each other

634
00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:00,620
there's a management VLAN oh and there's

635
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:02,330
transparent IP tables rules that route

636
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,658
everything over tour so even if you pop

637
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:08,210
the virtual machine you get nothing if

638
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:11,870
you then previous can use a hypervisor

639
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:14,149
escape you still have nothing and I've

640
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:16,908
got some O'Day so I would like someone

641
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:18,320
to do that and then only if you find a

642
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:21,140
bug in the tour Damon or something like

643
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,700
that or in iptables do you didn't have a

644
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,460
chance of DN on amaizing this server

645
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,559
which is kind of like the ideal

646
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,480
situation if you are running a dark net

647
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,700
market and I would hope if someone like

648
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,289
Shels your server and then does a guest

649
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,360
a host I'd hope you'd have some we're

650
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:37,129
figuring that out like before it gets to

651
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,760
the point your DN Allah mised so that's

652
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,260
kind of the hardened freedom hosting

653
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,908
situation yes so it's all running on

654
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,320
super physical hardware pattern from the

655
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:47,090
virtual machines and it's hardened Jindo

656
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,279
based which back when I made it was

657
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,870
actually a viable thing to do now

658
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,090
hardened Ginty doesn't exist because the

659
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,459
whole G asik thing so maybe you're gonna

660
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,840
be a stay in the future but it's pretty

661
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,779
posting and then you can go back there

662
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,580
there's G's somewhere there was a good

663
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:03,740
have link in there which you can check

664
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,480
it out so I'm a gonna have on freedom

665
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,270
postings on github you can check out the

666
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,890
code and run it and there we are

667
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:13,220
so anyone have any questions or anything

668
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:15,080
like that are we doing questions ideally

669
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,830
not again no questions but you can come

670
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,189
and see me after if anyone has a

671
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:26,408
question

672
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:28,340
you're now welcome to ask again yeah I

673
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:31,520
so the question was how long did I run

674
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,620
it for I'm gonna say around six months

675
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,090
but it wasn't running the whole time

676
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,709
because I was developing it as I was

677
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,029
running it those are there like a two

678
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,309
year long project and you have to get

679
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:43,899
hardware and stuff I'd say around six

680
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:43,899
months but yeah

681
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,669
yeah so the question was how can you

682
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:54,970
detect or is there a way to take dodgy

683
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:57,039
sites now I believe if if you talk to

684
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:59,950
like dia you know the right people you

685
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,510
can get hashes if images that you really

686
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,919
don't want in your server that's one of

687
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,840
the detection mechanisms is just a hash

688
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:06,730
every image coming through and if you

689
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,039
have a list of bad hashes you can

690
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,390
immediately shut down these sites

691
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:11,830
keywords would probably also work but

692
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,690
you run the risk of shutting down slides

693
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,340
in this case I don't think there's a big

694
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,480
risk of like shutting down a legit site

695
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:22,120
because it's free like I don't care

696
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,919
remake it so there are some ways of

697
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,830
doing it but I think it's gonna be

698
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,750
manually a lot of the time because what

699
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,850
constitutes bad if they're new images if

700
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,409
it's just a site dedicated to something

701
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,059
really horrific but there's no images

702
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:35,530
you probably gonna have to look at the

703
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,730
stuff yourself which is a real downside

704
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,230
if you did wanna run this is that you

705
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,539
have to be constantly monitoring because

706
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,340
you you don't want to especially in my

707
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,539
case my rules where nothing immoral if

708
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,399
you wanted to run Silk Road like go

709
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:48,370
ahead I'm all for drugs but if you

710
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,929
wanted to run something else then no not

711
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,039
allowed I'm gonna be checking there I'm

712
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:52,179
gonna be shutting this down and I guess

713
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,520
I'm lucky I didn't have to deal with any

714
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:56,260
of that but automating it as a tough job

715
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:03,158
maybe it'd be interesting to do as a

716
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:04,629
project ya know so the question wasn't

717
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:06,549
manually approved and the answer is no

718
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,809
it was literally like I wish I had it

719
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:09,850
running right now to just show you you

720
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:12,070
literally click a button and it waits 30

721
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,418
seconds and then it says okay your

722
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,010
version machines ready these are the

723
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:18,190
details login you've got root on a

724
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:20,169
virtual machine right away so it was it

725
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,850
was fast it was free it was just click

726
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:23,500
it and get it which is how like a lot of

727
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,730
this free stuff should be especially on

728
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,190
tour where you don't want to give away

729
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,440
personal information why not just make

730
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:33,010
it instant and you can't really vit over

731
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,870
tour anyway like greg mcgregor a like is

732
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,710
he gonna do stuff how do you know like

733
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,299
are you gonna ask for personal

734
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:43,169
information well then it kind of defeats

735
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:43,168
the purpose so yeah yeah

736
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,940
you

737
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,429
you
