1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:14,709
yeah I'm Tom and this is my talk so I'm

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,920
gonna put this slide up I have no idea

3
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:20,439
what it means I just I love this slide

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,120
it's just gibberish you can you can look

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,160
at that while I introduce myself so yeah

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:28,240
my name is Tom I don't work in for a sec

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,830
I'm a developer so this is really

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,150
talking about IOT from a development

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:37,599
point of view rather than just hacking

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:39,070
stuff one point I'm I'm not here on

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,870
behalf of my company I haven't put my

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,450
company name on the slides it's not that

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,309
hard to find out who I work for some of

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,770
the things I may mention in this talk

15
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,470
may possibly pertain to current or

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,120
previous employers products please don't

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,350
run out and start tweeting about this

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,349
stuff because that would just be

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,820
embarrassing if you want to try hacking

20
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,829
a product that I may or may not have

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,120
worked on please go ahead you will need

22
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:05,340
to buy it which is great because that

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:10,840
pays my salary so feel free to do that

24
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:12,940
so IOT it's the standard slide where we

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,470
have a definition for IOT the Internet

26
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,298
of Things is the network of physical

27
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,729
devices vehicles home appliances and

28
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:21,190
other items embedded within electronics

29
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:23,500
software sensors actuators and network

30
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,470
connectivity which enable these devices

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,390
to connect and exchange data that one's

32
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:33,658
from Wikipedia you can find hundreds of

33
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:36,820
these definitions online bollocks its

34
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,710
IOT is just a buzzword that somebody's

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,229
made up recently what we're talking

36
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:44,009
about is embedded devices with network

37
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:46,270
connectivity this is not a new concept

38
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,900
network devices herbs or embedded

39
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,949
devices been around for a very long time

40
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,540
depending on how you define embedded

41
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,009
device it's usually acknowledged the

42
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,840
first embedded device was the Apollo

43
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:58,330
guidance computer which was in the

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,970
Apollo Rockets first flew in 1966

45
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,380
obviously developed before then a lot of

46
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,509
the devices you hear being hacked

47
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,390
things like webcams the first webcam was

48
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:10,060
the Trojan coffeepot in 1991 again not

49
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,069
really a new concept routers get hacked

50
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,069
routers the first router was called the

51
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:16,970
nicknamed the bread truck in 1976 these

52
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:23,410
aren't new they

53
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:29,090
for a long time what's the problem well

54
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:32,180
the problem is I have teased a bit of a

55
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:35,990
tire fire it's it's causing a lot of

56
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:39,020
problems it's not going that well what

57
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,970
will easy about IOT that means we had to

58
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,880
define a new buzzword for it what does

59
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:47,570
it mean when we talk about IOT well

60
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,560
firstly the numbers webcams routers

61
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,170
those kind of things they've been around

62
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,050
for a long time but the sheer volume of

63
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,640
products we're talking about now I got

64
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,560
these estimates I don't I don't quite

65
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,690
know what definition of IOT they're

66
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,040
using I'm sure you can make the numbers

67
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,290
go one way or the other by changing the

68
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,019
definition but yeah this year they

69
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,989
reckon eight point four billion IOT

70
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,750
devices connected the internet right now

71
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:16,630
that's a big number last year was 6.4

72
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:21,140
billion so that's an increase of 30% 31%

73
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:24,579
estimates 2020 twenty point four billion

74
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,768
devices that's an awful lot of devices

75
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,600
so that's one of the Tom's is that one

76
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:31,190
of the things that really defines IOT is

77
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:37,359
the sheer volume of devices we're

78
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:39,890
talking about longevity IOT device is

79
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,560
expected to last quite a bit longer than

80
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,850
other products most one I'm not sure

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,500
you've all got a mobile phone most

82
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,769
people tend to replace their phone every

83
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,860
maybe two years if you're a real Apple

84
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,480
fanboy maybe one year if you tend to

85
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,540
drop your phone down the toilet six

86
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,010
months I don't know IT devices are

87
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,230
expected to last a lot longer you think

88
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,700
about something like a washing machine

89
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,230
you really don't expect to be replacing

90
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,429
a washing machine more than every maybe

91
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,630
10 years if you're buying brand new some

92
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,120
products are expected to last even

93
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,310
longer than that these aren't your

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:19,459
typical cheap throwaway products they're

95
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:21,079
expected to last for a while pretty much

96
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,930
the definition of embedded devices they

97
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,330
have minimal or non-existent UI some of

98
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,070
them some of them have more you think

99
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,188
about some of the definitions of IOT

100
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,308
include

101
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:33,899
electric cars they often have got a big

102
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:35,309
UI and then you've got things like the

103
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:39,809
light bulb where you've got just nothing

104
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:42,709
at all it's harder to interact with the

105
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:47,279
user without them making that decision

106
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:50,719
and finally security there's

107
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,719
security on these things is terrible

108
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:57,568
now when I talk about security what

109
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:59,539
am I talking about well I suspect you've

110
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:04,019
all heard of the mirror I bought now

111
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:05,610
there's sort of the big news that IOT is

112
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:09,059
rubbish which didn't really come as a

113
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:12,599
surprise to other people roughly 200,000

114
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:13,889
devices in the original botnet since the

115
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:16,529
source code release it's actually grown

116
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,909
although it's not much use anymore it's

117
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:19,709
sort of fragmented because people are

118
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:21,899
using different bits of it but it was

119
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:24,409
able to generate these enormous DDoS

120
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:28,649
attacks firstly on crabs secondly on din

121
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:30,119
big numbers 623 gigabits per second one

122
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:34,439
terabit per second London these are

123
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:36,839
these are big attacks and all Mirai was

124
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:41,069
was a set of default credentials for

125
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:43,619
some 60-plus devices where these devices

126
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:46,559
somebody had hard-coded in this

127
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:48,749
particularly since hanjo Ching Maya I

128
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:52,199
think devices all had the default

129
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:53,789
username password on telnet so first of

130
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,740
all they left telnet turned on and

131
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,938
secondly they had these hard-coded

132
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,099
passwords I don't think you could

133
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:03,029
actually change them even if you wanted

134
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:04,800
to and the other thing that made that

135
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,119
bad was these world white-label devices

136
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,069
so they weren't selling those devices

137
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:09,959
themselves they were selling them to

138
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:14,969
other manufacturers to either rebadge or

139
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:19,259
put into other products mirrors kind of

140
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:22,589
been a gone we've now possibly got

141
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:25,229
Reaper based in partner Mira it's using

142
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:26,959
those same default credentials they've

143
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:29,490
added a bunch of other attacks for

144
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,349
routers and some surveillance cameras

145
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,849
kind of high-end webcams these are a

146
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,110
little bit more advanced using things

147
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:36,438
like buffer overflows and those products

148
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,699
most of these have already been patched

149
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,649
but very few people are upgrading the

150
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,569
devices partly because of that minimal

151
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:43,279
you are you

152
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,589
difficult to tell the device has an

153
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,759
upgrade available unless you're actually

154
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,759
logging into it and having a look

155
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:52,240
estimates our repo a bit vague at the

156
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:54,589
moment

157
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,599
somewhere between ten twenty thousand

158
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:57,819
devices and a million devices depends on

159
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:02,240
who you ask

160
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:03,919
hasn't yet been used in the wild I would

161
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,689
guess it's pretty much guaranteed to go

162
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,099
off when RIS risky business goes on

163
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:12,349
holiday because that's usually when

164
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:13,550
things turn to there's this other

165
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:15,610
one had you may had Jimmy's really

166
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,539
interesting it's a more sophisticated

167
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,689
implementation that has a better control

168
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:22,009
command control process but the really

169
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:23,659
bizarre thing is when a device gets

170
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,089
taken over by the hajime botnet a

171
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:28,629
message appears on the terminal says

172
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:32,509
just a white hat securing some systems

173
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:34,159
which suggests that maybe someone has

174
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:36,649
actually written a botnet to go and

175
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:39,289
capture these devices before anyone else

176
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:42,999
does so they can't be used by the bad

177
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:47,029
guys or it's a bad guy just pretending

178
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:49,550
we don't know so had you made something

179
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:51,709
like 300,000 devices also not yet used

180
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:59,209
so it may turn out to be malicious

181
00:07:51,709 --> 00:08:04,969
we just don't know so why are these

182
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:08,689
products associate well I'm a developer

183
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:11,449
I work for a company a company has a

184
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:13,969
budget company has resource developers

185
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,589
to work on things you have a choice do I

186
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:17,959
want my developers to work on security

187
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:19,039
issues or do I want them to work on

188
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:23,959
making team products

189
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,938
adding features fixing existing bugs you

190
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,219
tend to go with the new models and

191
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:30,050
features it's as simple as that there's

192
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:32,088
no real benefit right now to fixing

193
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,519
security there's no real legal

194
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,050
requirement there's nothing that says

195
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,229
you can't ship this product because the

196
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:41,659
security shed some of this is being

197
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:43,610
discussed in the u.s. in Europe but it's

198
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,920
not really clear how this would work yet

199
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,569
it's not really feasible for every

200
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,319
single product to go through some sort

201
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:52,729
of government certification process

202
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:54,270
maybe it would be a voluntary thing it's

203
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,820
difficult to say

204
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,620
there are some things the FTC is

205
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,970
currently suing dealing I don't know if

206
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,450
it's going to be successful or not

207
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,100
over there insecure routers and webcams

208
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,540
it's possible that that might be enough

209
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,850
to scare the industry into making things

210
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,459
better I doubt it because the rate of

211
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,600
which they're suing people is just it's

212
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,050
a pretty good gamble that you're not

213
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,850
going to get hit

214
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,339
there's no consumer interest in security

215
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,710
you can't sell a product with securities

216
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,140
of feature charge more for it and expect

217
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:28,440
people to pay for more for it you can

218
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,330
put security on the box as a word and

219
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,050
I'm pretty sure marketing people do that

220
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,730
all the time

221
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,250
with no real justification for it at all

222
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,450
oh this is a secure web cam it's exactly

223
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,440
the same as the other web cam but it

224
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:41,760
costs 20 bucks more there is I think

225
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,230
Australia and possibly some other

226
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,000
countries are discussing this idea of a

227
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,380
securing rating scheme so it's similar

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,390
to when you buy a washing machine and

229
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,830
it's got the thing on the front that

230
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,710
shows you how much water it uses per

231
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,970
load would be some idea of a star scheme

232
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,230
or something like that saying when

233
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,510
you've got one star because you've

234
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,430
managed to turn off telnet 2 stars

235
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,470
because you provide updates or something

236
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,589
like this 3 stars because you've

237
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,060
actually used a hash something along

238
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,070
those lines and that would encourage

239
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,719
consumers to actually go for the the

240
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:14,100
more secure products maybe that might

241
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,050
work there from is companies drop

242
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,690
products they end-of-life products

243
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,180
companies go bust well they get bought

244
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,400
and then shut down and there's no real

245
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,400
way of maintaining support for a product

246
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,510
once the company who made it disappears

247
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,100
maybe you could have something where you

248
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,170
put the source code and the keys for

249
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,640
that product in escrow and if the

250
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,939
company goes bust you can then get

251
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,030
access to it so you can maintain support

252
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:40,950
it's not something I've ever seen done

253
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,600
and the other thing is some bits of

254
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,490
hardware you have the ability to install

255
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,970
your own firmware so open wrt is a

256
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,770
pretty well-known open-source version of

257
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,870
linux that you can install on routers so

258
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,329
you can wait to set up the router the

259
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,370
way you want to do it but there are some

260
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:59,280
limitations have a hardware allows you

261
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:03,439
to install we'll talk about that a

262
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,790
little bit so

263
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:08,339
in my slides actually said that oh well

264
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,868
top 10 for IOT was new it's not new

265
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,329
actually I realized it was actually

266
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:16,259
posted up there in 2014 and obviously no

267
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:19,979
one's read it yet but let's go through

268
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:23,879
it anyway it's still relevant so number

269
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,139
one insecure web interface yeah I'm not

270
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:27,329
really sure about the ordering here

271
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,739
insecure web interface seems unusual to

272
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,738
put a number one because a lot of IOT

273
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:33,209
products don't have a web interface but

274
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:36,209
I kind of see where they're going with

275
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:37,618
this attack uses weak credentials

276
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,029
captures plaint exponentials or

277
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:41,160
enumerates accounts to access the web

278
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:44,339
interface pretty obvious stuff the

279
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:47,160
reference is up here this was written in

280
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:50,369
2014 they referenced the eyewash top 10

281
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,679
from 2013 I've updated the references to

282
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:54,929
the the most recent 2017 month which I

283
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,670
think was finalized last week so you can

284
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:59,119
talk in there talking about injection

285
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:02,099
cross-site scripting cross-site request

286
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:05,309
forgery that the standard web interface

287
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,929
problems well though I'm not I'm not

288
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:08,488
sure how many IOT devices where you get

289
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:10,259
things like SQL injection a lot of IT

290
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:12,329
devices don't really have databases on

291
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:16,619
them so again I'm not sure how relevant

292
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:19,679
that one is on a product I may or may

293
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:21,899
not have worked at in the past our web

294
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,540
interface is just based on the standard

295
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,309
busybox web server with some CGI scripts

296
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,309
with some shell scripts for the CGI

297
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:31,350
stuff it's really really basic stuff and

298
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:35,429
I'm quite sure those shell scripts have

299
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,480
got bugs in security bugs in and if you

300
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:40,738
really want you can have a look at them

301
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,869
and tell me number 2 insufficient

302
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:44,399
authentication and authorization I kind

303
00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:48,419
of think this is where Mirai starts to

304
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,069
fit in having telnet open with default

305
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:54,739
credentials that's that's a pretty good

306
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:54,738
example of insufficient authorization

307
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,470
that

308
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:07,109
yes and you can see how that is going to

309
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:07,109
be an obvious problem you need to fix

310
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:11,889
insecure network services attack users

311
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:13,839
mobile network services to attract the

312
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:16,239
device itself or bounce attacks off the

313
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,929
device so this is pretty standard stuff

314
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:22,319
unnecessary open ports UPnP obviously is

315
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:24,879
a problem exposing ports to the Internet

316
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:27,969
and then you get these weird ones like

317
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:29,289
Wi-Fi access to the network what I'm

318
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,609
talking about here is in particular

319
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:32,889
there was a product couple of years ago

320
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:36,519
called I kettle was an Internet

321
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:37,600
connected kettle I did you often hear

322
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,699
people say why on earth would you make

323
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,199
something like this the question to

324
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:43,868
Prince Prince Tamar on why on earth

325
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,728
would you buy this what possible use

326
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:47,889
case do you have for an

327
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:49,989
internet-connected kettle and it did

328
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:52,749
occur to me earlier after seeing the

329
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:55,059
earlier talk about the light bob iot

330
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:57,100
light bulb maybe all of these products

331
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:58,419
are being bought by pen testers who are

332
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,789
writing conference talks

333
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:03,639
maybe there's a business model there I

334
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:05,139
don't know the problem in the eye kettle

335
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,669
was you I think there was a mobile app

336
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:09,429
or something and you enabled the kettle

337
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:12,159
to connect your house Wi-Fi by giving it

338
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:16,509
the SSID and the password the problem

339
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:18,879
was the kettle didn't check that the

340
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:19,419
SSID was using the same level of

341
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,970
encryption

342
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:26,228
it was previously so you could use a

343
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,970
stronger signal with the same SSID knock

344
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:30,249
the couple off the house Wi-Fi it would

345
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,019
then connect to your Wi-Fi but you

346
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:35,729
didn't have encryption turned on and it

347
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:35,729
just gave you the password for the house

348
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:44,589
so there you go you've got creds pretty

349
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:49,169
stupid bug did occur to me that I should

350
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:53,679
probably check my source code guess what

351
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:55,779
say bug it's it's an easy mistake

352
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,999
I didn't occur to me that you might have

353
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:59,439
an SSID without the same level

354
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:02,019
encryption turned on so you just present

355
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:03,129
the password to and I wouldn't be

356
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:05,259
surprised to find there's a bunch of

357
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:07,600
other products out there that have the

358
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:09,189
same bug in and a part of the problem

359
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,100
with with embedded devices is you're not

360
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:13,569
relying on existing software like

361
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,790
Android or something like this you're

362
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:17,620
writing this stuff you're

363
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:19,660
self-sow the same mistakes get made over

364
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,430
and over again okay not as dumb as

365
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,499
leaving a telnet turn on with default

366
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:28,540
credits but I can imagine this is a

367
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:32,620
common bug lack of transport encryption

368
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:35,379
integrity verification this is really

369
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,899
about the data being passed possibly

370
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:39,759
between devices on your network so maybe

371
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:40,990
you've got a bunch of light bulbs and

372
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,800
they talk to each other or something

373
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:47,290
like something along those lines

374
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:52,029
the problem here is that the solutions

375
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:54,430
we have right now for encryption most of

376
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:56,019
most of them are relying on internet

377
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,359
access they're all built for websites

378
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:59,920
and things like this and the problem is

379
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,850
you can't guarantee that these products

380
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,378
are going to be connected to the

381
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,329
Internet there are lots of situations

382
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:06,160
where you take an IOT product and you

383
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:08,370
connect it you've got your IOT lightbulb

384
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,170
you connect it up on your house on a

385
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,610
local network because you're a security

386
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,899
person you don't want to expose these to

387
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,339
the Internet and then you use your phone

388
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:17,129
on the same local network and they never

389
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:19,899
connect to the internet which is fine

390
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:22,059
except if you're relying on being able

391
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:24,579
to get upgrades or new certificates when

392
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:26,800
the old ones expire you've also got the

393
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:28,689
problem of some of these products get

394
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,430
made and then left in a warehouse for a

395
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:33,420
couple of months and then you get them

396
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:36,128
out of the box and all of a sudden

397
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,689
they've been in a box for five years and

398
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,189
the certificates on them have expired

399
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:42,670
and then you connect to the internet and

400
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:44,410
they don't work so you can't just make

401
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,589
those same assumptions about products

402
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,089
that you can on the Internet Darry there

403
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,800
are even more complications when you

404
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:52,689
actually want different products made by

405
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,490
different manufacturers to connect

406
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:57,579
together I'm on a Standards Committee

407
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,750
for some domain specific stuff where

408
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:00,069
we're talking about different

409
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,509
manufacturers making products that want

410
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:04,990
to communicate together in an encrypted

411
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:06,159
way how do you manage that especially

412
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,230
when those products may never get

413
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:11,230
connected to the internet it's quite

414
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:13,149
difficult and if you really want to know

415
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,339
about this stuff how much Ryan's talk

416
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:16,928
from Christchurch hexagon it's worth it

417
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:20,339
because he explains Pekar with emoji

418
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:20,339
which is impressive in itself

419
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,360
so moving swiftly on privacy concerns

420
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,980
obviously a major one the data that gets

421
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,139
collected by these devices is it being

422
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,230
stored securely now I said there's no

423
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,120
legal read requirements for releasing

424
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,580
IOT products but stuff like this is

425
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,219
starting to come under a legal framework

426
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,100
so especially in the EU the GD P R which

427
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:49,630
kicks off I think on the 25th of May

428
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:51,399
next year so not long now has these

429
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,020
requirements for things like user

430
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,960
consent and see you know normalization

431
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:59,290
of data interesting there's a legal

432
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,000
obligation to notify the authority in a

433
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,980
debated breach within I think it's

434
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,420
within 72 hours which is really

435
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,160
interesting because especially we look

436
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,450
at a case for uber they covered up their

437
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,940
data leak they don't want to tell anyone

438
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,710
about it they're now in the Europe

439
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,780
anyway if you're collecting data on

440
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,360
European citizens which you but uber

441
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,850
obviously do they would be obliged to

442
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,429
tell the authorities within 72 hours of

443
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,730
finding the breach and the fines for

444
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:27,550
this stuff are pretty impressive 20

445
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:30,280
million euros that's 34 million New

446
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:32,260
Zealand Dollars or up to four percent of

447
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,960
the annual worldwide turnover whichever

448
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,910
is greater now there are companies that

449
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,580
are making more than 35 million dollars

450
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:41,590
four percent of their annual turnover so

451
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,320
these spines can be really significant

452
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:47,020
maybe this is what starts to really kick

453
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,389
off the privacy process but this is just

454
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:54,520
the storing of the data online this does

455
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:57,300
not affect the devices themselves in

456
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,680
secure cloud interface an obvious one

457
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,090
probably not as bad as it sometimes is

458
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,050
obviously to connect to the cloud you

459
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,780
have to be on the Internet

460
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,919
so you should have access to updates

461
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,720
most of the cloud providers are doing a

462
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,880
reasonable job of providing security you

463
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,360
stick with stuff like edit less it's not

464
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,640
too hard in check your mobile interface

465
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,649
this is a little bit more complicated

466
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,000
I put Bluetooth in here because an

467
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,680
obvious one when you have a mobile app

468
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,060
you want to be able to connect your

469
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,520
mobile device to the device you're

470
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,250
talking to you might be using Bluetooth

471
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,540
and I'm being very frustrated with the

472
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,120
amount of information there is about how

473
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,620
to make Bluetooth secure

474
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,290
what's best practice the Bluetooth SIG

475
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,879
of which we all remember released this

476
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,379
could launch studio quite recently which

477
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,240
helps you to configure your Bluetooth

478
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,890
products not so much phones and stuff

479
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,360
more like when you're making an actual

480
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,700
embedded device that's got Bluetooth

481
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,080
built in and they had a webcast for this

482
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,420
thing and I actually asked and look at

483
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,320
the question does this help me check for

484
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:55,120
security best practice no is there a

485
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:59,169
security best practice of Bluetooth that

486
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,239
you publish no so I mean they kind of

487
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,530
invite this stuff to themselves the best

488
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,150
guide I've found is actually published

489
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,280
by NIST at the end of that it's kind of

490
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:10,360
out of date because Bluetooth 5 just

491
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:13,270
means it's being released insufficient

492
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,629
security configurability I'm not sure

493
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:19,450
this applies to IT devices sorry IOT

494
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,890
device is a huge amount you tend to have

495
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,300
the security they come with that doesn't

496
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:27,300
tend to be a human out of configuration

497
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:30,100
in their insecure software and firmware

498
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,710
again I'm in somewhat two minds about

499
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,120
this one if you completely lock down

500
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,530
your device with secure boot and

501
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,899
encrypted firmware and things like that

502
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,460
it means that no one can then ever be

503
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,470
able to replace the firmware with

504
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,640
something they genuinely want to use and

505
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,740
that's kind of one of those ongoing

506
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,140
arguments if I've paid for the hardware

507
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,930
don't I have the right to do with it

508
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,990
what I want and I suspect this one's

509
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,700
gonna go on for a while poor physical

510
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,400
security I mean this is an obvious one

511
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,680
I remember Matthew Garrett hacking a DVD

512
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,270
player and key week on a couple of years

513
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,490
ago by basically putting a file on the

514
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,050
deep on the SD card and it it read the

515
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,440
file and turned off the security and God

516
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:11,680
knows what so that's the other was top

517
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,750
ten for IOT it most of its kind of

518
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:20,680
obvious but it's good to have it written

519
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:23,650
down somewhere so it's really important

520
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,680
to be able to get firmware updates for

521
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,630
these products as I mentioned earlier

522
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Reaper is including those nine attacks

523
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:35,230
for devices where they don't that these

524
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,580
these issues have been patched but a lot

525
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,620
of customers just aren't applying the

526
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,689
patches and so these devices remain in

527
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,889
the world and they're still vulnerable

528
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:45,220
so you need to be able to update the

529
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,630
firmware the problem is as I said a lot

530
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,040
of these devices don't have some sort of

531
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,670
UI so they're not just gonna be able to

532
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,540
pop up miss

533
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:54,850
saying please update me often the user

534
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,379
has that the owner has to go and log

535
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,590
into the device something to be able to

536
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,150
see there's an update available so the

537
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,370
obvious solution there is to make the

538
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:05,410
updates automatic well that's all very

539
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:07,149
well but you've got to be very careful

540
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,670
when you're updating devices in the wild

541
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,260
and if it's a washing machine okay

542
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,420
the washing machine knows when it's

543
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,620
actually doing the washing cycle if it's

544
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,600
just sitting there not doing anything at

545
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,239
all then it can probably do an update

546
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,330
itself without too much worry but if

547
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,500
you're talking about things like cars

548
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:26,470
industrial control systems you can't

549
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,150
just update them just like that it needs

550
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,820
to be some sort of synchronization there

551
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:34,240
so it really depends on the device

552
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,830
you're talking about it needs to be

553
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,630
tested on real Hardware variants now

554
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,770
this this is something I think a lot of

555
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:41,890
people don't quite understand when you

556
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:45,600
make a product and you start

557
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:49,060
manufacturing it you don't just stop

558
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,500
products constantly evolve probably the

559
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,790
biggest thing we have to deal with is

560
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:57,670
changes to NAND so a few years ago all

561
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,710
of the fab switch from 42 nanometer to

562
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,690
21 and then more recently they've

563
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,790
started me switching to 19 so the chips

564
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,190
you're using in the product go

565
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,290
end-of-life and you have to replace them

566
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,030
with new chips and sometimes it's a new

567
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,620
generation of flash and you need to

568
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,420
upgrade your kernel to be able to get

569
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,580
that support in for the flash drivers

570
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,650
and that kind of thing

571
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,270
hardware evolves there was a product I

572
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,880
may or may not have been involved in a

573
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:24,280
few years ago where we actually upgraded

574
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,080
the CPU and then we slowed down the

575
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,990
clock speed because the new CPU was

576
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,199
faster than the old one so the two

577
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:34,180
products looked the same it sounds nuts

578
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,470
but we didn't want customers going into

579
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,670
a shop and buying two products and

580
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,690
finding one of them was running faster

581
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,400
than the other it doesn't make any sense

582
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,930
to them just because one of them has

583
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,010
been on a shelf for six months and one

584
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:45,490
of them has just come straight from the

585
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:47,260
factory so you end up with this sort of

586
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,620
legacy support of a whole bunch of

587
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,940
different hardware variants in the field

588
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,770
there was a case quite recently where a

589
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,720
company called lockstate have these

590
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:57,490
internet collected blocks which were

591
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,990
recommended by Airbnb and they did a

592
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,620
firmware update and bricked a whole

593
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,180
bunch of them

594
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,840
brick them to the point where they had

595
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,090
to be returned

596
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:08,139
to the manufacturer so they could fix

597
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:10,178
them sound like a funny story but I'm

598
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,140
pretty sure that what happened was they

599
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:13,750
had a bunch of different hardware

600
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:16,299
variants in the field they tested the

601
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,440
update on some of those variants didn't

602
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:19,740
realize it was going to brick the other

603
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,809
ones and did the update over there and

604
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:25,150
this is a problem that has to be dealt

605
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:26,590
with if you're talking about say you are

606
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,600
a company that's been going for a few

607
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:33,039
years you ship maybe 30 different

608
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,840
products you have got between one and

609
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,490
ten hardware variants of all of those

610
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,870
thirty products and then you want to do

611
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,880
a software release across all of them

612
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,110
that's quite a bit of testing that has

613
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,970
to be done just to make sure you're not

614
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,320
breaking them that doesn't even make

615
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:48,669
sure that there aren't any bugs in the

616
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,980
software so it's a big overhead the

617
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:52,390
download path needs to be secure and

618
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,770
obviously if your connection to the

619
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:56,799
Internet to be able to get the downloads

620
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:59,168
you can use TLS to verify who you're

621
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,730
talking to you can use certificates to

622
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:03,520
make sure the security the software has

623
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,020
been signed but as I said if that

624
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,520
products been sitting in a warehouse for

625
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,460
five years and the certificate bundles

626
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,289
expired then maybe it can't even connect

627
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,039
your server to download the update with

628
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:17,470
this fresh set of certificates in

629
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:19,779
there's there's also case quite recently

630
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,159
the logitech harmony link logitech

631
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:26,529
end-of-life this product quite

632
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:28,990
unexpectedly and the rumor is that this

633
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:31,390
was because they used in Equifax root

634
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,429
certificate and the roots to view it was

635
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,600
lost and suddenly they had absolutely no

636
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:36,850
control over the security of their

637
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,279
product and the easiest thing for them

638
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:41,139
to do was to brick it I don't know if

639
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,210
that's true or not but I can see exactly

640
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,250
how that happens you choose a

641
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,049
certificate authority and suddenly you

642
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:50,070
find out five years later that they were

643
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:52,330
all dodgy and you can't rely on them

644
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:54,789
these are all problems that are going to

645
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,309
be coming up and the other thing is the

646
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:59,860
update part needs to be secure supply

647
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:01,559
site attacks are happening quite a bit

648
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,600
especially this year there's being

649
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:06,820
ccleaner where a signed version of this

650
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:11,399
offer was put up on their website which

651
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:13,809
included malware medoc was the

652
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:15,129
accountancy software that contained the

653
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:17,139
petia

654
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:22,660
malware that was released in Eastern

655
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:24,640
Europe Minter linux mint transmission

656
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,170
which is a BitTorrent client all of

657
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,250
these have been basically shipped off a

658
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:32,380
server or a website containing malware

659
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,840
and again if somebody hacks into your

660
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,070
servers and it enables to put out some

661
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,810
sort of malware choice offer how do you

662
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,159
stop that happening especially if

663
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:41,740
they've got access to the build server

664
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,180
which contains the signing certificate

665
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,880
for your software

666
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,800
it looks valid but until someone

667
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,920
actually checks you don't know it's

668
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,180
happened now I did read a paper a while

669
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,100
back I thought I couldn't find the

670
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,780
reference where someone came up this

671
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,490
idea or having multiple certificates you

672
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,560
sign your software we say three

673
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,090
different certificates and each of those

674
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,950
certificates is held by a different

675
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,860
person so in order to release the

676
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,710
software it has to go through each

677
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:11,560
individual person to get signed off

678
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:13,450
probably very secure quite difficult to

679
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,590
implement the real how do you how do you

680
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,030
get that running through a build system

681
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,980
what happens when one of those people

682
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,600
goes on a holiday what happens when one

683
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,070
of them loses the Yubikey they had the

684
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,620
keystore done or something like that

685
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,210
it's it's one of those problems I don't

686
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,370
really know how you fix that one but

687
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,050
server-side attacks are very supply-side

688
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,179
attacks are becoming more common and

689
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:33,310
it's going to be a problem what's the

690
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,380
point of hacking the device when you can

691
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:45,760
hack their server and own all of the

692
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:47,610
devices in one go so my summary IIT is

693
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,540
going to get worse before it gets better

694
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:51,610
there are eight point four billion

695
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,399
devices out there an awful lot of which

696
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:56,260
we've got crap security there are

697
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,060
developed devices in development right

698
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,490
now that are going to be released

699
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,350
shortly that also have crap security and

700
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,780
frankly that's going to keep happening

701
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:07,719
because developers are stupid I'm a

702
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:10,360
developer I'm stupid I make these kind

703
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,220
of problems all the time it's it's easy

704
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,389
to do that example of the Wi-Fi

705
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,910
connection problem I was talking about

706
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:19,240
it was just an oversight on my part but

707
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:21,760
it happens one product I may or may not

708
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,520
have worked on the first time we shipped

709
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,260
it I put the root certificate for the

710
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,610
particular certificate we were using on

711
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,920
the website so I could connect to the

712
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,320
web

713
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,600
and then a year later the web guys

714
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,040
replaced that certificate with a

715
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,780
certificate from a different provider

716
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,909
and our product stopped me able to

717
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,530
connect my emails what are you doing

718
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,690
we've got to get this certificate from

719
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:44,480
the same provider and they said no we

720
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:47,110
can't because that asset of it was 128

721
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,340
bit and we have to replace it with 256

722
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:52,219
we had to go back to the original

723
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:54,770
provider pay them additional money to

724
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,020
get 128 bit certificate for the next

725
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,879
year so we could make sure the products

726
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:01,610
would update in the field to be able to

727
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,470
support the new provider you can't just

728
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,820
rely on being able to use the same

729
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,630
certificate authority over and over

730
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,189
again so now we build in a bundle which

731
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,360
is better but have they said if your

732
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,430
product and ends up on the shelf for

733
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,469
five years you can't always rely on the

734
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,700
certificate in the bundle some of our

735
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,950
products are going to have bundles which

736
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,870
contain a valid equifax certificate and

737
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:26,210
until we upgrade them we can't really do

738
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:30,500
anything about that so yeah we need help

739
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:33,470
I mean some of this stuff yeah taking

740
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,660
out 1084 credentials I mean yeah it's

741
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,160
easy it's so obvious it's frustrating

742
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,500
how many one managed to do this stuff

743
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,480
but some of these more complex problems

744
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,220
don't have solutions yet how do you deal

745
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,630
with expiring certificate how do you

746
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,310
deal with devices that may not be

747
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,630
connect to the internet wanting to

748
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:51,169
communicate with each other on private

749
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:52,850
networks I'm still kind of waiting for

750
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,170
someone to to figure this one out

751
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:57,350
maybe it's gonna be me it's more like

752
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:58,460
it's gonna be Ryan I just don't know and

753
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,110
the other thing is it would be really

754
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,870
great to have some CI tools for this

755
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:04,490
stuff the one I've been thinking about

756
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,929
or trying to find a solution for

757
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:07,310
actually is I want to be able to do

758
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,990
man-in-the-middle testing on my product

759
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,360
to make sure I haven't screwed up the

760
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,680
TLS there but it would be really great

761
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,750
if I could make that part of our build

762
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,850
process so every time I do a build it

763
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,410
then runs that check and I'm sure it's

764
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,679
possible to do I haven't found a tool

765
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:22,910
that will do it for me yet and I suspect

766
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,650
anyone who has done this just doesn't

767
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:26,450
shared it out yet and maybe I'm gonna

768
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,580
have to work my own or hack something

769
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,980
together these kind of tools will be

770
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,419
really really useful so not so much you

771
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,920
get the product right first time but you

772
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:37,850
can then make sure you're going to get

773
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,040
right every time you do it change and

774
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,540
finally

775
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,720
I don't know what's gonna happen with

776
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:46,090
these botnets I'd the idea of like a

777
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,920
white hat versus black hat botnet fight

778
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,300
it's I don't know I reckon there's a

779
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,310
movie on there somewhere come on they

780
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:54,010
made the emoji movie this is actually

781
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:55,330
you know so yeah I mean maybe how'd you

782
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:57,040
make it turns out to be bad maybe it

783
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,570
turns out to be good maybe this is an

784
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,260
ongoing thing I don't know it's gonna be

785
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:12,960
interesting to find out okay thank you

786
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:12,960
very much any questions

787
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,629
well the EU isn't gonna collect sorry

788
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,310
the question was who's pushing the EU

789
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,790
regulations the EU isn't going to

790
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:27,610
collapse

791
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:30,490
Britain's leaving probably but the rest

792
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,870
of the you still going quite well and I

793
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,790
mean even if the you Durst collapse

794
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,840
that's just a legal framework I wouldn't

795
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,129
be surprised to find that other

796
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,080
countries start adopting something

797
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:41,170
similar but I mean even if that

798
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,370
particular legislation collapses I think

799
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,170
that's the general train and people are

800
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,719
realizing there needs to be more control

801
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,580
around privacy around data online what

802
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,870
happens that data what happens to

803
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,879
companies that are stupid enough to

804
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:54,280
store the passwords in plain text online

805
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,720
it we need something to drive these

806
00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:05,399
changes because it's not going to happen

807
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:05,400
on its own sorry said again

808
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:17,120
that legislation kicks in in May next

809
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:17,120
year I don't know

810
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:30,030
yeah that's the point was made about

811
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,560
Microsoft open document formats the EU

812
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,629
would definitely sued companies in the

813
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,580
past they sued Microsoft years ago for

814
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,260
Internet Explorer being included windows

815
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,000
I think they've sued Google for

816
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,060
something similar and weird to do with

817
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,800
Android the microcell of document format

818
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,750
was actually produced as a result of

819
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,090
legal threats in that Microsoft had to

820
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,860
open up their data so not so much with
