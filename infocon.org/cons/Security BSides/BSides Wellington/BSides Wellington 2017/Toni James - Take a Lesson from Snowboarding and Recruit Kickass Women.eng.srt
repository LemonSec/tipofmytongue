1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,750
awesome so my name is Tony James and I

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,980
just submitted a talk to take a lesson

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,049
from snowboarding so you recruit

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,560
kick-ass women because I come from the

5
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:21,400
snowboard industry and just recently

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,080
became a software engineer and I really

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,090
wanted to I saw a lot of similarities

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,930
between what was happening in the tech

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:32,140
industry and more recently in security

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,850
and what had previously happened in the

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,380
snowboard industry where I come from so

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,400
this is on how to recruit and keep

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,810
kick-ass women because what's the point

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,690
of recruiting them if you don't have

15
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,980
policies in place to keep them and I

16
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:50,530
will do my best to not talk too fast

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,199
this is me both me both sides this is a

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:56,110
professional me you know the selfie in

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,930
the bathroom and this is also me and I

20
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,329
have anxiety and one of the 33% that

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,940
Amanda talked about yesterday that has

22
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,829
been diagnosed and anxiety and some days

23
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,810
that's all I want to do is yes Thank You

24
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:11,199
Ally Sheedy for doing exactly what I

25
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:13,270
want to do right now um and this is also

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,889
me so this is uh this is me on the top

27
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,229
of mount hutt this is fourth of July a

28
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:19,509
bunch of the American snowboarders went

29
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:22,600
out similar than skiers to celebrate for

30
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:26,679
the July and you know be awesome and

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,029
ride down the hill with a flag but so I

32
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:30,310
am American not Canadian

33
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:32,469
that was close only a few hours away

34
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,729
from the border and I qualify as an

35
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:37,419
international speaker so that's pretty

36
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:41,439
cool and this was my life for a very

37
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,779
long time pretty awesome and this is me

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,729
at the top of remarkables I've held

39
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:48,158
several positions in snowboarding I've

40
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:50,679
been an instructor for most of my life

41
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,459
but also was a coach I was a company

42
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:59,819
director a camp director I definitely

43
00:01:54,459 --> 00:02:03,099
enjoyed it ended up traveling between

44
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:06,340
Maine and Colorado finally to New

45
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:08,560
Zealand back in 2003 in fact I met my

46
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,989
husband in the lift line down at snow

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,970
park and a lot of people think this is

48
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:15,280
what I do all day when you're snow

49
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,620
working the snowboard industry it just

50
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,580
ride perfect chord all the time not

51
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,100
quite

52
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,120
and this is pretty much what I would do

53
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,810
all day this is me and this is my friend

54
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,540
Emma who's we're really good friends now

55
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,730
but she was really scared to do

56
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,579
snowboarding because she took a lesson

57
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,440
from her boyfriend and it was horrible

58
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,170
so anybody who's ever well taking a

59
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,420
lesson from their boyfriend understands

60
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,540
that it's not the best thing to do for a

61
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,769
relationship I don't recommend it um but

62
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,230
there's one thing that we do in

63
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:53,530
snowboarding that I think relates to a

64
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,840
lot of life let in several things in

65
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,420
life and we do something called teaching

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,860
for transfer so if someone comes to me

67
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,450
and they took a two-hour snowboard

68
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,790
lesson I need to teach them to snowboard

69
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,339
in two hours it's pretty difficult right

70
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,989
they are handing me their fear they're

71
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,060
handing me their physical prowess

72
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,920
they're they're handing me all of these

73
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,540
things that I need to manage so that

74
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,630
they have an enjoyable time and come

75
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,940
back and do it again so one thing that

76
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,460
we work on is teaching for transfer

77
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,050
which means that say Emma came to me and

78
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,060
she was an excellent horseback rider and

79
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,709
that's what she really understood and I

80
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,450
understood horseback riding so I was

81
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:31,450
able to get her to get into her riding

82
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,799
stance I was able to basically take the

83
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,119
five things that you have to work on

84
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,790
when you're learning to snowboard and

85
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,440
reduce it down to two things because she

86
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,450
had the muscle memory to already

87
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,500
understand how to do things with her

88
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:47,260
body and I just needed to add to that

89
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,760
and so it's a really good tool and a

90
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,959
technique it's really hard technique you

91
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,030
know I've had people come to me that

92
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,620
have never done sports in their lives

93
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,970
so I was like well what do you do and

94
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,280
they're like well I play chess I'm like

95
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,020
all right let's think about this what

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,840
can we you know what can I use from

97
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:05,880
chess that I can transfer into

98
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,750
snowboarding and I definitely through

99
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,989
through going back and forth between

100
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,360
Colorado and New Zealand this was my

101
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:16,840
office right and this is sorry for the

102
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,970
low res photo this is my office and

103
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:23,409
notice the awesome tech that we had in

104
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:25,180
snowboarding and it was when I came out

105
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,800
of high school it was my choice to

106
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,870
either go do a computer science degree

107
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,180
because that's what I wanted to do or go

108
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:34,610
snowboarding and I went snowboarding

109
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,639
to me back in the day when in computer

110
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,949
science degree the only thing I saw in

111
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,710
computer science the time for jobs and

112
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:47,810
for lifestyle were you know a bunch of

113
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:51,109
old white people in the basements of

114
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,479
like a company like GE wearing short

115
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,100
button-up shirts you know and it just

116
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:56,810
wasn't appealing snowboarding was way

117
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,470
more appealing so I went and did that

118
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:03,350
and really really really enjoyed

119
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,539
traveling all over the world competing

120
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,449
and coaching and and doing all these

121
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:10,699
things with snowboarding but it gets to

122
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:14,120
a point where you either progressed into

123
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:17,030
the management track or you kind of do

124
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,349
the seasonal so it's every day every

125
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,659
year's winter so you're going from

126
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:22,099
winter winter which we did and my

127
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,840
husband I enjoyed that we went back and

128
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:26,900
forth for a while but then you missed

129
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,770
your house and you missed your dogs and

130
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,500
you missed your life for basically half

131
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,599
the year depending on where you're at

132
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,000
and so it became really hard and then I

133
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:40,460
decided to have a family and it became

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:47,120
even harder traveling with the little

135
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:48,440
one is great right but we did travel we

136
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,470
worked on it we tried it but when she

137
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,449
turned 2 and she basically cost me

138
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,880
another plane ticket I decided not to do

139
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:57,349
that anymore

140
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,680
but in New Zealand where we decide to

141
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:04,880
settle down and winter is like five

142
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:09,380
months long maybe so my career my work

143
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,659
was probably four months long and that's

144
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,820
not sustainable right I had a mortgage I

145
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:17,210
had family and my husband actually does

146
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:20,330
have a sustainable a course or a

147
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,799
sustainable career in the industry and

148
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,150
the fact he still works at mount hutt

149
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,970
and he's been there for 20 years

150
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,739
which is fantastic but I didn't want all

151
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,470
our eggs in one basket I don't want to

152
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,840
rely on Mother Nature to take care of us

153
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,889
and just take care of our mortgage so I

154
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,119
thought all right what can I do and

155
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:39,440
basically I went back to the very

156
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,580
beginning and said hey look remember

157
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,520
when I made that choice between

158
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,380
snowboarding or programming I'm gonna go

159
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,070
back to programming and I thought the

160
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,440
easiest

161
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,230
easiest I thought the best way to do

162
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,290
this was to do a full-time university

163
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,900
degree and focus on software engineering

164
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:59,330
yes that was not easy especially not

165
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,419
easy as a mom not easy traveling and

166
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:04,820
commuting to the University it was hard

167
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,440
it was very very hard and in fact in the

168
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,890
first year is when I was actually

169
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,540
diagnosed with anxiety and it's

170
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:15,530
something that I've had and had symptoms

171
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:18,590
of almost all my life but it was it was

172
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:21,590
the second semester it was midterms my

173
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,820
dog had just died I was juggling a

174
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,739
three-year-old trying to go to

175
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,650
University trying not to let anybody

176
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:32,650
down and pretty much lost it during a

177
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:36,169
midterm and went to the free clinic and

178
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:38,929
had a talk with a professional and he's

179
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:41,390
like yep you've got anxiety doesn't

180
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:46,250
everybody it's fine

181
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:48,530
but I got help and then made it through

182
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,260
University graduated last year focused

183
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,489
on software engineering and interned in

184
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,260
software engineering and got a job in

185
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,780
software engineering so whoohoo yay

186
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:00,080
success and now this is what my desk

187
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:05,150
looks like um notice the Reese's Peanut

188
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:08,620
Butter so still still American but less

189
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:11,390
about me and more about kick-ass women I

190
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:14,930
first want to talk about what a kick-ass

191
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:17,360
woman is right because not many women

192
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,450
will be like yeah I'm kick-ass hire me I

193
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,850
will because I know I'm kick-ass but I

194
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:26,030
know I am because I've had people my

195
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:28,400
entire life tell me I am have had

196
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:31,369
constant positive reinforcement from

197
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,699
people telling me how kick-ass I am and

198
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,409
how amazing I am and it's really hard to

199
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,919
say that up in front of a roomful of

200
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:42,228
people because it's intimidating but I

201
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,590
guarantee every single person in this

202
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,150
room knows a kick-ass woman I also

203
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,530
guarantee there's not many nice people

204
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,689
in this room that will put their hands

205
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,740
up and say I am a kick-ass woman because

206
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,530
they haven't had enough positive

207
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,540
reinforcement in their life so with

208
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,600
Ben's talk yesterday about giving praise

209
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:02,120
please tell people around you

210
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,180
yes you know you are kick-ass and you

211
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,950
are kick-ass because of this you are an

212
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,689
amazing person because of this and the

213
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,490
more that they hear that the more

214
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,050
they'll internalize it and eventually

215
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,770
they'll be able to stand up here and say

216
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,449
yes I am a kick-ass woman so I'm gonna

217
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,610
tell you a little story because you

218
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,190
heard you know to to find out about

219
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,920
snowboarding right there's this company

220
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,550
called Burton and I ended up working

221
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,900
with Burton for quite a quite a while

222
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:32,000
working on some programs working on some

223
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,370
women's programs and Jake and Donna are

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,710
the owners Jake is actually one of the

225
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,090
event inventors of snowboarding a little

226
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,910
bit of controversy there but he is one

227
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:44,870
of them and started back in the late 70s

228
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:47,300
and when in this is the company now so

229
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,860
now it's around a thousand people it's

230
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,540
House employees they have offices all

231
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,000
over the world but there's still a

232
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:56,089
privately owned company still owned by

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,490
Jake and Donna which which is important

234
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,290
because it means that they were able to

235
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:02,950
do things that maybe other companies

236
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,180
can't do because they have to answer to

237
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,540
financial reports or things like that

238
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:11,479
but when snowboarding started it was

239
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:15,500
equally pioneered by both men and women

240
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,660
it was a sport that had no gender it

241
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,370
wasn't a male-dominated it wasn't female

242
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,680
dominated it was completely equal a lot

243
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,540
of people don't know this because that

244
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,520
wasn't you know big of the day that

245
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,770
wasn't snowboarding was like this thing

246
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,350
that surfers and skaters and punks and

247
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:32,689
misfits kind of went and did and they

248
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,450
were very welcoming community but then

249
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:41,950
in 1998 and not gonna olympics happens

250
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:45,140
and what that means to snowboarding is

251
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:46,880
boom town all of a sudden snowboarding

252
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,790
was global snowboarding was the coolest

253
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,880
thing in fact there was a gold medalist

254
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,990
in this first snowboard event who tested

255
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,130
positive for marijuana

256
00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:00,410
so again made it like the the the read

257
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:04,760
kind of thing to do is to go

258
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:08,439
snowboarding and Burton as a company

259
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,370
just boom grew it grew massively and

260
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,750
they started pulling from all these

261
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,100
other industries because they needed

262
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,230
people fast they

263
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,370
needed people in their industry so

264
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,630
they're pulling from ski and they're

265
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,330
pulling from skate and they're pulling

266
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:23,240
them surf and all of those cons all of

267
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:25,580
those companies all those industries had

268
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,790
we're quite male-dominated so all of a

269
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:33,260
sudden boom Burton becomes pretty

270
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:36,709
male-dominated in fact in 2003

271
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:40,189
Jake walked into a Board of Directors

272
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:45,560
meeting and there were 25 people in the

273
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:49,730
room there were three women and Jake

274
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:53,060
said oh this is what we call the oh

275
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:54,440
 moment he realized that absolutely

276
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,729
we've got a problem

277
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,950
there is no way we can be innovative

278
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,510
there's no way we can put it out new

279
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,550
products there's no way we can be a

280
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,900
successful business if we've only got

281
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:07,300
three people in there three women in the

282
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:10,699
room so he went to Donna this is Donna

283
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,469
she she's his wife but also his business

284
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,940
partner she was away from the company

285
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,950
for a little while raising raising the

286
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:19,250
children and said look we've got a

287
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:21,560
problem we need to fix this and you know

288
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,410
I think you can do the best job of this

289
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,300
so then she had a vision and she had a

290
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,230
purpose and so she came back and she

291
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,209
started the Women's Leadership

292
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,520
Initiative like this is actually what

293
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,070
it's called it's still called this WLI

294
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,170
Women's Leadership Initiative and this

295
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,390
initiative basically she went around the

296
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,699
company and pulled women from every

297
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:43,460
department from every seniority level

298
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,370
and created her own round table of all

299
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,950
of these women and said what are the

300
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,660
short-term opportunities we can do to

301
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,610
increase women leadership in this

302
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,160
company and what are the long-term ones

303
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,980
we can work towards so she took action

304
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,410
and she sat down and they created this

305
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,810
list of goals and there this is still

306
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,850
ongoing they the leaders initiative

307
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:08,810
still going they're still creating new

308
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:11,690
initiatives all the time and but I'm

309
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:14,180
gonna talk about three kind of three

310
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:16,910
categories because these are the ones

311
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,589
that have the most impact because you

312
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,959
want to see results right as a company

313
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:23,300
you want to actually see growth so they

314
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,860
focused on family mentorship and

315
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,579
recruitment as they

316
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,079
family is when she talked to these women

317
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:32,399
no one saw themselves in the company no

318
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,500
females found themselves in the company

319
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,240
beyond five years definitely no doubt 10

320
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,370
years in the company because as soon as

321
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,990
they had a family

322
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,550
they left the company as soon as they

323
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,410
stopped to have kids

324
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,510
there was no pathway to progression to

325
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,300
get them back into the company into the

326
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:50,100
industry so they said how can we fix

327
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,279
this and they talked about it and in the

328
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,500
u.s. they don't have paid maternity or

329
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,170
paternity leave so it's up to the

330
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,899
companies to have progressive maternity

331
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,790
leave policies so that's what they did

332
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,230
they're like alright this is the first

333
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,849
problem that we can solve we can

334
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,920
actually give you some paid maternity

335
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,810
leave and we can keep in touch with you

336
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,099
so that you know what's going on so that

337
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,349
you can actually step back into your

338
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,200
position but then also when you step

339
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:18,810
back into your position going from zero

340
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,450
days a week to going to five full days

341
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:24,329
of work a week it's really difficult for

342
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,190
a mother from experience all of a sudden

343
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:28,019
you have to think about before school

344
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,070
care if your child is even in school yet

345
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,990
do you have to think about after-school

346
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,610
care and before that you need to think

347
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,790
about child care so they offered

348
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,470
flexible working days we could do four

349
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:41,730
day weeks or you could do limited hour

350
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:44,130
days and then they also it sounds really

351
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,310
good like they have paid child care it's

352
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:50,490
not that simple but basically if you had

353
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:52,250
a child under 18 months and you traveled

354
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,740
within your job like many people dead

355
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:58,170
for a global snowboard company then they

356
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,209
would send a care taker with you to take

357
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,099
care of your child so that you could

358
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:05,369
still do your job into your business or

359
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,380
they would provide childcare for any

360
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,240
children under 18 months for children

361
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,220
over 18 months they actually developed

362
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,829
some partnerships forcement with some

363
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,170
childcare organizations around the

364
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:21,660
company and to offer subsidized

365
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:24,750
childcare so taking care of family they

366
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,939
also went with mentorship and they

367
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,649
decided to start to mentorship programs

368
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,660
one was a grassroots one and one was the

369
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:33,000
senior management one so the grassroots

370
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,100
one was for everyone every single person

371
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,079
in the company and it just matched you

372
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,120
up with someone slightly more senior it

373
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,040
was slightly slightly more experienced

374
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,509
and it could be for a few months it

375
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,490
could be four years it's whatever

376
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:46,319
organically grew out of the mentorship

377
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,050
and the other one was the senior

378
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:51,628
management fixed term so for six months

379
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:53,240
anyone and a director level because they

380
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:56,100
go from director up to executive

381
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,079
received a six month internship from an

382
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,529
executive I'm sorry a six month

383
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,949
mentorship I think that's what I said

384
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:08,129
and what they saw was that from this

385
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:09,779
program in two years sixty-two percent

386
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:12,660
of the women that participated in this

387
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,309
program either were promoted or moved

388
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,290
into a line of business that better

389
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:17,910
suited their goals because they're able

390
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,689
to talk about what they wanted to get

391
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:24,509
out of the company it was so successful

392
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:26,639
that everyone in the company all the men

393
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:28,559
said hey wait a minute

394
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,019
we want that too because that sounds

395
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:34,199
awesome I want to progress I want those

396
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:36,509
things so this is another example for

397
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:39,269
things that they did for specifically to

398
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:41,129
benefit women they ended up opening up

399
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:42,870
to the entire company and also with

400
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:45,179
mentorship they made it could they ended

401
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,519
up making it co-ed so you for me in

402
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:49,740
mentorship I have had many male mentors

403
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,110
in my life that they don't always have

404
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:55,050
to be female and it is nice to have that

405
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:59,429
perspective but it was whatever works

406
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:00,959
for you and then recruitment they

407
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:04,589
realize they were doing recruitment all

408
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:07,049
wrong they had no photos they had a

409
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:10,408
photo than a photo advertising

410
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:13,349
snowboarding and it was a guy jumping

411
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:15,029
off a 30-foot cliff and they realized

412
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:16,168
that women look at that photo men look

413
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:18,059
at that photo be like yeah I can do that

414
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:19,110
and women look at that photo and be like

415
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,480
nope That's not me

416
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:24,240
snowboarding is not for me and I

417
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,579
actually remember this time in

418
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,679
snowboarding when I would look at those

419
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,928
photos to be like yeah that's not that's

420
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,760
not gonna happen but then they started

421
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:37,620
putting out marketing photos of women

422
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:39,899
riding rails or doing wall rides or

423
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,090
doing some really what to me was much

424
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:43,649
more achievable once I saw those I was

425
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:47,039
like yeah I want to try that I can do

426
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:49,110
that they also worked on programs that I

427
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,510
ended up working on which were the

428
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,889
women's learned to ride programs which

429
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,800
were specific programs

430
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,990
just women only classes getting them on

431
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,760
the mountain so that was what they did

432
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,760
for the public and then for within the

433
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:07,050
company they had women ride days and

434
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,879
there's actually a there's a rule on the

435
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,230
company it's a two-foot rule as soon as

436
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,910
they get two feet of snow the company

437
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:16,230
actually closes shuts the store and goes

438
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:19,200
riding it's pretty good right but they

439
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:22,070
they initiated this women on the

440
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,210
mountain for all of their employees and

441
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,490
basically they just spent today and went

442
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,050
riding and it's really empowering to go

443
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,790
snowboarding with other women it's it's

444
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:32,159
it's to me mountain biking and

445
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,200
snowboarding is what I do and I love

446
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,750
taking the time and just having a

447
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,460
women-only group to do that with and I

448
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,070
try new things and I feel comfortable

449
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,710
and safe and also it actually had a dual

450
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:46,320
purpose because the men saw what it was

451
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,410
like to have a whole day without women

452
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,090
in the office and it was pretty rough

453
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:54,570
they didn't get a lot done

454
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:56,429
so it helps they also had the new hiring

455
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,669
practices they realized at the time

456
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:02,640
they're only getting about 30 percent of

457
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:04,380
their applicants were women and they

458
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,230
realized their entire hiring profit

459
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,330
process was really quite biased I know

460
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:12,000
in tech we have we have lots of issues

461
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,679
with the hiring process so what they did

462
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,720
is they proactively sought candidates

463
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,580
within their company and better trained

464
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,650
so so female candidates within a company

465
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,990
and better trained male managers to

466
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,840
actually do the hiring for females so

467
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:28,350
they not only controlled the whole

468
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,970
process they controlled what ended up

469
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,379
happening for women as soon as they

470
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:36,780
applied as soon as they walk through the

471
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:38,760
door now at Burton they're 50/50 all of

472
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,710
their new hires there they have achieved

473
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,030
for all of their new hires complete

474
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:47,880
gender equity and this is a good quote

475
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:50,310
from Donna back in 2012 is like let's be

476
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,890
honest you know it can be frat boyish

477
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,389
totally frat boyish but as soon as you

478
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,360
add more women to the room you change

479
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,370
the culture of the company and it has

480
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,149
and they are extremely successful

481
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:04,860
because of us the leadership team this

482
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,390
is this goes back to the bullet point I

483
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,689
had on the one woman policy which is a

484
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,150
little

485
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:12,180
fusing but the leadership team in 2004

486
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:14,520
was less than 10% female so the one

487
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:18,990
woman policy means that any leadership

488
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:22,889
program application basically needs to

489
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:25,380
have one woman in it at least that does

490
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,570
not get its priority over anyone else

491
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,480
that's applying for that position but

492
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:33,620
needs to be one woman on the table at

493
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:38,400
the moment today they have more than 40%

494
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:40,469
female leadership within their team so

495
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,690
you know I'm spinning through this kind

496
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,270
of fast because I talk fast anyway

497
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,370
sorry about that but I wanted to focus

498
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,860
on on the end which is basically to

499
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,899
recruit and keep kick-ass women you need

500
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,760
to focus on families you need to

501
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,130
motivate mentorship within your company

502
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,470
and you need to revelon revolutionize

503
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,120
recruitment and I hate seeing saying to

504
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,740
anyone that they need to do something

505
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,659
because people try to do the exact

506
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,990
opposite you tell them but these are

507
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:11,330
facts and figures that show basically

508
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:13,770
what snowboarding has achieved and I

509
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,780
having been in the snowboard culture and

510
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:18,270
having been in the tech culture as long

511
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:21,110
as I have now I see so many similarities

512
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:24,210
when I developed this talk I created

513
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,770
three or four other talks on all of the

514
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,630
similarities that can be had between

515
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,639
snowboarding and snowboarding can't be

516
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,770
the only one this is a fantastic success

517
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,320
story of a company that has focused on

518
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,620
implementing measures to make sure they

519
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,210
can increase women's leadership and

520
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,800
there's got to be more successful cases

521
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,840
out there we keep looking to other

522
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,629
companies to other tech companies to

523
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,730
solve this problem it's not Google's

524
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,950
problem it's not Apple's problem it's

525
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,720
not it's everyone's problem but there's

526
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,030
other people that have done things out

527
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,430
there so please take a lesson from

528
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:58,560
snowboarding because when you become a

529
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,270
better place for women to work you

530
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:04,760
actually become a better place for

531
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,760
everyone to work so thank you

532
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,770
you

533
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,350
you
