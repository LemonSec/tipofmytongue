1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:10,469
all right so hopefully the Sun is yeah

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,640
my presentation is about how I found

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,669
fishing kits so when you found some

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,250
fishing cats the numbers is too big so

5
00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:28,329
it's around about 20,000 fishing kits I

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:34,260
found the research was started from

7
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:37,660
March this year and I just took snapshot

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:42,190
yesterday so the total number I have

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:43,300
20,000 my presentation would be divided

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:49,510
in three phases

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:50,199
so first phase is what the tool work how

12
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,300
it works

13
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:57,730
itself what sort of indicators and

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,089
interesting stats I'm pulling from those

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:04,479
fishing kits plus the second phase when

16
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:08,980
it goes it's more about detail analysis

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,710
of those fishing kits related to few New

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:15,630
Zealand banks and third would be the

19
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:19,839
demo of my tool

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,899
so before I start that's the boring

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:27,090
stuff we need to get sorted so whatever

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:31,480
I am presenting here it's just my

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:35,370
interest and my hobby sort of thing

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:40,360
nothing to attribute with my employer

25
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:42,700
and all those fishing kits obviously can

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,800
be used for malicious purposes so I

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:53,260
promise that I haven't used for

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:55,450
malicious purposes yeah so that's how I

29
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:00,310
see the world and most of the

30
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:02,290
information security guys here agree

31
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,830
with me so I've been working in

32
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:09,039
information security 10 years now last

33
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:10,899
two years more specifically at the core

34
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,559
member of cyber security incident

35
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:18,220
response team and one of the New Zealand

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,380
largest bank so obviously

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:24,700
you work in the third you deal with

38
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:27,370
those fishing things I mean that's the

39
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,769
biggest threat we have and everyone

40
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,920
agree on that because it's targeting

41
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:36,640
every other industry and you will see

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,250
how easy it is to set up and what sort

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,679
of information you can just get from

44
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:47,380
user like login right so first I would

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,770
want to give a shout out to the these

46
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,480
guys the people the individuals or the

47
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,860
group of people behind these names

48
00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:01,870
because I've been utilizing these api's

49
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:05,560
to do some hunting yeah let's get

50
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:10,390
started so how it all started it's when

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:14,200
we work as a in a cert we see the

52
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:17,320
fishing URL going for our employees or

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,810
our customers what we do we just capture

54
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,930
those URLs and then put the takedown

55
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:26,230
request that's it I mean it's takedown

56
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:29,110
and that's it but that's going one step

57
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:33,070
further to build some sort of

58
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:35,560
intelligence behind what is those

59
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,230
fishing kids being utilized more and

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,610
more or only particular fishing kits

61
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:45,869
being active for certain period and what

62
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:50,920
sort of actors behind those fishing kids

63
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:58,870
so all these information was really keen

64
00:03:50,920 --> 00:04:02,980
I was really keen to find out so after

65
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:05,830
doing some research obviously I went to

66
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,510
the dark world as well because I can't

67
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:13,030
find this kind of information in the

68
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:16,380
clear net so how it works when you talk

69
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:19,149
to some scammers and they said that

70
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:23,560
there are two kind of fishing gets one

71
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:27,370
is duplicate and one is develop one so

72
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:31,020
the duplicate one is really has really

73
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:35,890
good chances to picked up by all those

74
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:38,440
avy or whatnot but the developer one is

75
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,570
because they developed from scratch so

76
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,240
they you can't match the hash of the

77
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:48,130
page so obviously it's not really easy

78
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,380
to detect so there are some price

79
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,780
difference as well because for the

80
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,080
duplicate one you can just get it in

81
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:59,169
under ten dollars and obviously

82
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,539
developer one you need some guys to

83
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:05,500
actually develop it so it's around 50 US

84
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:08,940
dollars something so when you ask them

85
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,650
that okay I want to get the fishing kit

86
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,080
what is the procedure so they gave you

87
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,989
the zip file in that zip file they said

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,210
to you that okay what you are targeting

89
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,420
you are targeting some financial

90
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,070
institute or you just targeting some

91
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:28,210
hotmail Gmail or Dropbox or whatnot

92
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:32,610
so you tell them that okay I'm targeting

93
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:36,130
this and then they said that this is the

94
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:39,730
PHP file you just need to modify the to

95
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:42,960
address to your email address where you

96
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:47,860
want all those credential coming through

97
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:51,700
so once you get that zip file you look

98
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,640
after the compromised website or you

99
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:57,099
actually put the shell up and compromise

100
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:01,210
the site legit site to put your fishing

101
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:04,030
kit over there and then unzip it so that

102
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:09,760
you can send that complete URL to all

103
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:11,979
those target audience now the third step

104
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,260
would be the SMTP where you're gonna

105
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:17,800
find the SMTP so you need to find the

106
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:22,000
open relay SMTP server where you can

107
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:25,830
just bulk send those email addresses the

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,010
fishing links target audience is really

109
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:32,510
easily can be fine because you just go

110
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:36,650
to the Google and do the scrapping and

111
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:40,310
what I was your target audiences you can

112
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:42,679
find so it would be really difficult to

113
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,380
pull those fishing kits because they are

114
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:50,330
getting really smarter so they put the

115
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:52,370
geo logical filter place and the fishing

116
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,680
kits so obviously if you are targeting

117
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,300
New Zealand Bank so they expect you

118
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,160
coming from New Zealand so obviously if

119
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,810
you're coming from Russia or oh man yeah

120
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:05,990
they will just it will not work so this

121
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:10,100
is about the tool how it gonna work so

122
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:14,350
it's a continuous process running from

123
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:17,390
March so the step one is it it has to

124
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:21,830
automated and manual ways how it works

125
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:25,580
so automated is getting URLs from fish

126
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:30,919
tank and open fish and roughly I see 40

127
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:35,599
to 50 new URLs from both of those fish

128
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:39,200
fish tank and open fish manual is we

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,630
have the within a banks different banks

130
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,849
we have the platform where we can share

131
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,510
the Intel intelligence and obviously we

132
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:49,550
can share that with certain set as well

133
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:53,330
so once we find the fishing URL I just

134
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,340
dump that into that script now you need

135
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,859
to make sure that this square prong

136
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,830
anonymously because the last thing you

137
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:03,020
want is those bad guys see your IP

138
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:06,950
addresses or your user agent and all

139
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:10,010
that stuff so for that yeah it's really

140
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:12,860
hard because if they block you or they

141
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:16,370
just want New Zealand specific so if you

142
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:21,080
are using VPN or tour you will not be

143
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:26,050
able to see those fishing us the second

144
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:29,659
phase is once you have a fishing kit

145
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:33,140
downloaded it will start pulling some

146
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:35,410
indicators the Indian just interesting

147
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,330
indicators like email addresses which

148
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:42,110
attacker modify the cyber criminals

149
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:46,200
modify their email address to this is

150
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:49,620
the sample of how that pH

151
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,580
P the thing they modify so the thing

152
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:56,070
they modify is this to address and

153
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:58,800
that's it and all that sort of

154
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:07,350
information they are collecting from the

155
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:11,120
customers they are targeting third and

156
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:14,100
that last step is just hash out those

157
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,990
unique fishing gets and build the

158
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,030
database of the unique because most of

159
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,640
the time what happened that you see the

160
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:22,949
fishing kit and it has been utilizing

161
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,880
I've seen so many fishing gets being

162
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:29,760
utilized again and again and again so

163
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,460
they never change it so only way when

164
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,010
they change the to address whole hash

165
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:38,010
will be changed so it is obvious they

166
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:41,010
are not they are the same person who are

167
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:44,220
you to lysing those fishing kids this is

168
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:48,630
the latest screenshot yesterday I took

169
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:51,110
it says that how many fishing gates I

170
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:54,180
have and as soon as you run this script

171
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:57,810
it will give you all these latest

172
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:03,109
numbers in the database so the emails so

173
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:07,079
far collected for those scammers or

174
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:12,300
thirty thousand and the domains I have

175
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:14,310
seen three thousands so if you see that

176
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,660
twenty thousand is the total fishing kit

177
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:21,089
and the unique one is four thousand so

178
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,709
that makes sense I mean because most of

179
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:26,460
the kids being utilized for different

180
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:31,140
domains as well so there are different

181
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:34,470
domains in here now what is that vt

182
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,480
match so what I am doing as soon as I

183
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,640
download the fishing kit I checked with

184
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,180
the virustotal that if I are still able

185
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:47,130
to detect it so out of those fishing

186
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:51,390
kits unique ones only this number

187
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:56,339
virustotal can detect it so what

188
00:10:51,390 --> 00:11:00,819
interesting things I have found so far

189
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:04,089
utilizing this - is that so

190
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:06,130
I have fishing kits available in my

191
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:08,740
database of all these brand because

192
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,540
these are the bands which like prominent

193
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,880
to me and I have searched it but

194
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:17,160
obviously there are some other fishing

195
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:21,519
gets bands as well so because my

196
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:25,810
background is from financial institute I

197
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,579
am more focused on this side so I wanted

198
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:33,329
to know that what sort of fishing kits

199
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:37,000
available for which banks so some stats

200
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:41,109
as I've been showing you that email

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,860
extracted so this is kind of old from

202
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,720
that snapshot so still the hotmail is

203
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,240
the first choice for the guys

204
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,050
cybercriminals

205
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:59,889
loving the hotmail most common brand in

206
00:11:53,050 --> 00:12:05,649
the database I have to Apple now this

207
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:10,300
chart is interesting is when the kid got

208
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:13,630
modified so I still have downloaded

209
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,359
three kids which were modified in 2006

210
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:21,130
and they have been continuously

211
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:24,759
utilizing their that get to even in 2017

212
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:30,389
so obviously nothing has changed since

213
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:34,839
2006 and they keep utilizing those kids

214
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:36,970
okay now I will do some deeper sort of

215
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,149
investigation for those financial

216
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:44,100
Institute's in New Zealand so first

217
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:50,649
first up is the Westpac so total I have

218
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:56,459
115 URLs fishing URLs which my script

219
00:12:50,649 --> 00:13:01,360
crawl so these are the dates when those

220
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:04,750
kids have been downloaded and these are

221
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,839
the domains right so kit has been

222
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,870
modified these these are kind of recent

223
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,450
ones

224
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:14,990
you can see this one is 2015 and this

225
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:18,620
one 2015 the other threat intelligence

226
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:22,220
piece I do here is I check the email

227
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,770
address with have I been pawned so what

228
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,740
I what I have seen what happened is that

229
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,870
they want to fake their identity so what

230
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,339
they see what they get is the email

231
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,850
addresses from the data breaches and

232
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:37,520
they start taking over those email

233
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,089
addresses and utilizing those email

234
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,180
address for this malicious purposes

235
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:47,180
there were few incidents happened when I

236
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:51,079
managed to find out whole lot of

237
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:55,550
phishing sites by just doing the reverse

238
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:58,040
lookup to the actor email address so for

239
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,199
example this is the email address at

240
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,829
reverse lookup that how many two means

241
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,320
this guy has so yeah they were that's

242
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,850
why I'm doing reverse lookup as well so

243
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,390
as you can see that this email address

244
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:15,279
have been born in daily mesh dailymotion

245
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:19,100
and myspace so there are chances that

246
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:26,020
someone who is saying behind this is not

247
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:30,910
actually behind this so this is for ASB

248
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:34,310
total number of fish I found that and

249
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:41,600
these are different fishing kits so same

250
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:44,689
story goes modified email addresses yeah

251
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,480
so this guy is actually I have to add

252
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:50,690
then some research and this guy is

253
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:54,050
actually targeting ASB for years and

254
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:56,420
years and his email address constantly I

255
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,089
keep looking at the new fishing kits and

256
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:02,750
there's some email addresses there and

257
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:05,270
if you simply google this email address

258
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:11,839
you can find all of his bank details and

259
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:14,600
everything so yeah so last one is the

260
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,970
Kiwi bank obviously I can't do analysis

261
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,690
for all the times because of the timing

262
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,690
sort of thing

263
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:28,080
yep so interesting thing in that is that

264
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:31,380
this guy have been known for all those

265
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:35,279
New Zealand banks the kids I have for

266
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,410
ASB B and Zed and respec this guy is

267
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:43,410
pretty common in all those fishing kids

268
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:45,180
and yeah if you search him he will be he

269
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,540
has a profile on Facebook and you can

270
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:53,010
see but I'm not saying it's saying that

271
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:56,060
he's actually the guy behind it right so

272
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:59,339
what sort of logs they are collecting so

273
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:03,089
it's really interesting how people fall

274
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:06,300
for those fishes I mean it's really they

275
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:09,930
are collecting everything I mean so if

276
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:13,109
you can see that user is actually giving

277
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:16,579
ATM pain phone pain what is the secret

278
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:19,020
name of your first pet and I mean

279
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,089
password is fine I mean you can give

280
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:27,529
passwords they are collecting every

281
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:31,230
every detail so when I was doing these

282
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:38,640
analysis because I as I mentioned that I

283
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:43,050
am pulling down zip file PHP file PNG

284
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:48,000
and then txt files that's what I'm

285
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:50,490
crawling all of the sudden in few months

286
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,500
after July I have started seeing this

287
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:59,339
crime side dot txt in most of those logs

288
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,860
I have pulled down from those sites so I

289
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:04,490
mean I was really confused because lots

290
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:08,220
of domain has this crime side dot exe

291
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:11,099
then I have started having chat in my

292
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:15,740
circle and asking different guys that

293
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:18,208
hey was that's crime side dot txt so

294
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,380
when you open those crime side dot exe

295
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:25,470
you find all those information that

296
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:29,700
cPanel I mean if it's a cPanel this is

297
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:33,280
the user of the attacker or the cyber

298
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:37,900
criminal is the IP addresses he used

299
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:41,470
and these are the email addresses of the

300
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:45,490
cyber criminal being utilized for those

301
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:49,150
sending those credential so I found that

302
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:51,370
this is done by one of the white hat

303
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:54,580
hacker who actually go to those

304
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:57,689
compromised website put the shell up and

305
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:02,320
then take over the server clean all that

306
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:04,900
phishing links and then just drop that

307
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,929
crime site dot txt so there are some

308
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:14,350
good guys actually doing work on behalf

309
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:19,270
of the organization's as well so as you

310
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:22,659
see that FBI head office at gmail.com I

311
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:25,330
want I was keen I wanted to know that do

312
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:31,030
my database have that sort of email

313
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:33,449
address and have I seen it before so yes

314
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:36,580
when I search with the email address I

315
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:41,890
found this email address associated with

316
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:45,639
the Aliexpress phishing it so yeah I

317
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:50,550
mean this has been utilized previously

318
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:53,940
as well right so now it's time for

319
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,940
recorded demo

320
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,189
any other

321
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:11,969
so no and I checked with the having pond

322
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,970
so this email address is not one on

323
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,340
so now it's ears

324
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:46,030
so this demo was recorded two months

325
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:48,310
back that's why you see the so now the

326
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:50,980
same thing is this is the hatch of that

327
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,470
fishing kit this is the domain and this

328
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,300
is the modified date

329
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:59,650
that's the date when it was downloaded

330
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:05,260
that's the email address and no positive

348
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,470

349
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:26,750
and it's not being born or nothing on

350
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:29,120
this so that's my talk it's really

351
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,640
interesting what information you can get

352
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:37,179
from those fishing kits obviously I have

353
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:39,260
to I can't show you all that stuff it's

354
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:44,780
some credit card information and all

355
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:56,830
that stuff also so yeah that's it thank

356
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:56,830
you if anyone has any questions yep

357
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:13,470
so there are two methods I'm crawling on

358
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,690
basis us off so one is the open

359
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:18,390
directory so if you find I found the

360
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:23,520
index off so you just look for that and

361
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:27,300
the other is you just put the zip on on

362
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:30,620
the end of that you are named so is V

363
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,620
dot zip and respect order

364
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:52,750
so that's not being a employee of

365
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,570
financial institute I can't directly

366
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:58,240
contact them so what we do we just share

367
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:00,389
the Intel with certain set so it's

368
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:09,580
certain Z responsibilities they can

369
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:11,640
contact so anyone else cool I think

370
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:16,329
thank you thank you

371
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,329
