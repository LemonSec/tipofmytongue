1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:10,370
hello everybody thanks for coming and

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:14,330
sitting for my touch I'm sorry I don't

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:17,900
know what happened to my slide some

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,939
strange line is appearing here sorry for

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,288
that first of all sorry for my voice I'm

6
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:25,869
sick I try to speak in a way that you

7
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:31,279
can understand what I say

8
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:35,390
so my topic is investigating recent

9
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:40,610
targeted attacks on APEC countries let

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:44,080
me start by introducing myself I'm sorry

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:48,490
just a second

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,489
strange things happen

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:57,260
I'm notion Shabbat and senior security

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:01:00,490
researcher at Kaspersky Lab areas of

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,710
interest for me or apt investigation

16
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,869
malware analysis reverse engineering and

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,550
forensic analysis anything that is

18
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:13,640
relevant to investigating cyber attacks

19
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:15,679
I've been with Kaspersky Lab for more

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,080
than one year one year and a half now

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:24,860
before that I was also working on a

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,750
antivirus company overseas doing the

23
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:32,720
same thing malware analysis and reverse

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:35,030
engineering in Kaspersky Lab I'm part of

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,460
a team which is called great great

26
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:41,330
stands for global research and analysis

27
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,130
team we are about 40 people all around

28
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,370
the world working on different

29
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:49,280
cyberattacks focusing on the same region

30
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:52,450
that we are based in that's why I'm

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,310
talking about attacks on APEC countries

32
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:58,010
my main focus is on Australia and New

33
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,369
Zealand and then other countries in APEC

34
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:03,950
region the people you see in this

35
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:07,520
picture or part of the part of the great

36
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:12,920
team we work very closely with our CEO

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:16,640
and we they are did the research team of

38
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,649
the company like if you ever and thought

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,040
and

40
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:25,680
see a webinar or read that report from

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,640
the company and this is what our team

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,700
does talking about the research that we

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,339
have been doing during the years it the

44
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,319
big research topics and big cyberattacks

45
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,470
that we have been investigating during

46
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,359
the years I started with Stuxnet in 2010

47
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,080
I'm sure that all of you know about the

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,879
Stuxnet it was a very big cyber attack

49
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,250
it was actually a revolution in cyber

50
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,459
threats and then you can see in this

51
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:57,569
picture that in 2011 we investigated

52
00:02:53,459 --> 00:03:02,459
another big big cyber threat Duke you

53
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:06,390
and then in 2012 a few big cyber threats

54
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:11,010
we worked on in 2013 you can see that or

55
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:13,319
more than five six 2014 15 and 16 you

56
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,260
can see that there are a lot of big

57
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,988
cyber threats that we have worked on so

58
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,769
it means that these targeted acts and be

59
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:25,769
cyber threats and what what we call it a

60
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:30,450
PT's advanced persistent threats they

61
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:35,190
are not on a continent some kind of

62
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:38,220
industry in for country in like Middle

63
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:42,690
East anymore it's everywhere on every

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,989
industry and every country and so that's

65
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,940
why it's very important to investigate

66
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,100
these cyber threats I know their

67
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,590
techniques and their intentions and what

68
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,930
they do and what they and predict what

69
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:59,910
they want to do next talking about cyber

70
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:03,200
espionage and cyber threats in APEC

71
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:07,530
countries and if you see this if you

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,988
notice these logos in previous slide we

73
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,440
make different logos for different ABT's

74
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:16,530
that we work on so as you see here there

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,329
are different examples of cyber big

76
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,659
cyber threats and cyber espionage

77
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:23,700
campaigns happening in APEC countries

78
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:27,240
there are these are some examples of

79
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:32,050
what we worked on and that the upper

80
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,389
ones are current cyber traits

81
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,990
and cyber-espionage campaigns targeting

82
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:40,509
APEC countries and the bottom one or the

83
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:44,470
trades that are originating from APEC

84
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:51,940
countries and maybe their targets

85
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:59,610
already by countries as well don't think

86
00:04:51,940 --> 00:05:04,569
you can see this slide completely okay

87
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:06,909
so let me talk about some historic cyber

88
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:08,860
trades and some major cyber espionage

89
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:11,680
campaigns that has happened on APEC

90
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,620
countries first of all let me start with

91
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,629
the big cyber threat which is reckoning

92
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:21,340
it just started in 2003 and as you see

93
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:24,280
in the map some of the APEC countries

94
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:27,960
are among the main targets of this cyber

95
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:31,359
espionage campaign it was a very complex

96
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,638
platform of cyber threats and it had

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,029
rootkits different trojans and it was

98
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,430
very advanced and a lot of companies and

99
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:44,949
countries have been among the targets of

100
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:47,860
this apt actor another one which you can

101
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:51,240
see some other APEC countries like India

102
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,729
and Mongolia were among the targets was

103
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,520
net traveler we investigated we

104
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:02,139
discovered this trade in 2013 but the

105
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:05,440
first attacks has happened in 2004 and

106
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:10,539
it was again a toolkit of cyber sphere

107
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:14,529
nage it had lots of tools and advanced

108
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:21,099
techniques and and methods that they

109
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:23,229
used to attack the victims another one

110
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:26,349
which is a very recent one it has sorted

111
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:29,378
in 2016 and we also discovered the

112
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:31,479
trades in 2016 and is started working on

113
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:35,860
it for the service finish campaign

114
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:40,419
operating out of India and some APEC

115
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:43,509
countries like China and Australia are

116
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:45,400
among the targets the cyber espionage

117
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:48,550
and hulky they are

118
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,750
very active and they also adopt new

119
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:55,419
techniques that that is coming up to

120
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:58,389
attack more victims and to be up to date

121
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:05,229
and use new new techniques and methods

122
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:09,460
every day but now I want to talk about a

123
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:11,800
few very big cyber threats that it's

124
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,620
happening on APEC countries at the

125
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,539
moment and are very current first one is

126
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,590
Lazarus I'm sure that most of you know

127
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:26,139
about Lazarus the apt actor which has

128
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:29,289
been active since 2009 at least they

129
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:31,660
have done many serious cyber threats in

130
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:35,460
the past like attack on Sony Pictures

131
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:39,789
Entertainment in 2014 which was very big

132
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:43,030
news another attack another very serious

133
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:47,110
attacks today and they they did was in

134
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:51,010
2013 an attack on South Korea which we

135
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:54,880
call it operation Troy and other these

136
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:57,580
are serviced finished attacks with by

137
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,800
Lazarus group another one was again

138
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,859
happened in 2013 we call it operation

139
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,940
Dark Soul it also happened on South

140
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:09,479
Korea as you see lots of the cyber

141
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,330
espionage campaigns that they have been

142
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:18,820
conducting and doing her on South Korea

143
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:20,770
before but then they changed their air

144
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:24,150
techniques and then they and they

145
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:27,190
started going after money as well

146
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:29,799
there's an there's a small subset of

147
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:33,270
there it's not a small subset but it's a

148
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,669
subset of their operations which which

149
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:39,779
more deals with money and stealing money

150
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:42,189
from different banks and different

151
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:45,700
industries and organizations and

152
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,800
companies that deal with money which we

153
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:51,910
call it blue North we actually

154
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:55,310
investigated these treads for about 10

155
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,219
months last year we

156
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,859
we did forensic investigation on many

157
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,259
big banks that has been infected and

158
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,249
attacked with this group and this

159
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:10,339
subject group of Lazarus and they and

160
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:13,550
lots of APEC countries were also among

161
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,870
the targets of this of these attacks and

162
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,008
they are still ongoing

163
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:20,240
still we find new attacks and new

164
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:22,459
techniques and new malware

165
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:28,040
every week and every day from this this

166
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:31,189
group and this group of losers you can

167
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,860
see in this map it is which shows the

168
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:37,339
geography map of the financial attacks

169
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,339
while others group many of the APEC

170
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:44,480
countries like Indonesia and Malaysia

171
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:47,600
among the targets so while I'm talking

172
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,459
about the APEC countries is that these

173
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,319
are the countries that are close to our

174
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,388
countries these are the countries that

175
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:57,319
we deal with in our businesses and it's

176
00:09:53,389 --> 00:10:00,649
important if we if you have a business

177
00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:02,930
with a country that is a main target of

178
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:04,790
many cyberattacks it's important to know

179
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:09,138
about these cyber attacks and be

180
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:14,959
cautious about that another one which I

181
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:17,870
I spent quite some few monsters on

182
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,268
investigating their attacks it's called

183
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:25,370
a spring dragon it's very interesting

184
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:28,809
apt actor it's been running since 2012

185
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,610
and the main targets are APEC countries

186
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:35,480
many of the APEC countries and they're

187
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:38,000
constantly expanding their targets to

188
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,670
more countries it has started with some

189
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,250
attacks on Taiwan and then they expanded

190
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:47,089
their attacks on different countries and

191
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:52,189
different industries they have a massive

192
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:55,240
scale of operation like a few times more

193
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:58,069
than many other apt actors that we see

194
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,160
III actually I did reverse engineering

195
00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:03,979
on more than 700 customers back door

196
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:07,550
samples of this apt actor which is a lot

197
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,519
compared to some other if it is compared

198
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,740
to most of the if it is that we work

199
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,519
they have a very big command and control

200
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:21,380
infrastructure they maintain more than

201
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:23,480
200 c2 servers and they use these c2

202
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,420
servers and different customized

203
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,990
settings on different on different

204
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:34,880
victims so they it makes the detection

205
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:37,310
more difficult talking about the

206
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,029
background of this research they started

207
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:43,279
in 2012 then in that time there was a

208
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:45,680
backup which was called alias a backdoor

209
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:49,970
to assist in cyber sphere not attacks

210
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:53,420
against some countries in in a pike

211
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:57,410
region and some other researchers have

212
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,310
worked on this on this apt as well why

213
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,410
they called it

214
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,138
ELISA backdoor because of the PDB pass

215
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:09,319
the malware developers left inside the

216
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:14,350
sample as you see here and then they and

217
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,890
we we spent some time working and

218
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,630
investigating the infiltration

219
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,930
techniques that they use they use

220
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:24,769
different spell fish exploits they use

221
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,959
they did web compromisers to infect more

222
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:30,769
people and then they also did some

223
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:33,399
watering hole attacks to attack more

224
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:35,839
victims and some targeted victims

225
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,899
different just falesha exploits they use

226
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,930
they use PDF exploits they still use

227
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:45,680
this kind of this kind of as proficient

228
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:48,109
emails and exploit files PDF exploits MS

229
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:53,000
world exploits Adobe Flash Player

230
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:56,750
exploits so they have have a good and a

231
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,160
strong set of skills and tools that they

232
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:04,760
use for attacking the victims talking

233
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,370
about watering holes and sometime in

234
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,410
2013 if I'm not mistaken they

235
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:14,000
compromised a web site to target some

236
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:17,600
organizations in Myanmar they this is

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,720
the website that they targeted as you

238
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,910
can see there are some files that people

239
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,860
could download from this website

240
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:32,270
the bottom the zip files this one's had

241
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:36,410
this was meant to have have fun and have

242
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:39,500
phones for Myanmar and I mean have tools

243
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,870
to render phones for me on more fond but

244
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,660
they're indeed spring dragon attackers

245
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,470
they change these files and put some

246
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:50,050
Trojans files there too infected

247
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:53,450
companies and organizations in Myanmar

248
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:56,170
another one they use sports flash

249
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:59,350
installer websites for some targeted

250
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:02,240
attacks on some governmental

251
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:05,930
organizations in some other Asian

252
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,350
countries they also put that the same

253
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,069
backdoor which which it's already ELISA

254
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,250
backdoor

255
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:16,100
inside this downloaded file for Flash

256
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,930
Player means that it installs the flash

257
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:22,210
player but it also installed some

258
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:25,790
background the victim system as well so

259
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:29,090
we spent quite some time on on the

260
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:32,630
techniques that they use back then but

261
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:37,720
then again it started in the beginning

262
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:42,590
of 2017 some news from the attacks on

263
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:46,850
Taiwan and I want arrived from one of

264
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:49,090
our partners we improved our detections

265
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:53,090
and we started receiving lots of

266
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:57,220
detections and lots of attacks happening

267
00:14:53,090 --> 00:15:01,430
all around APEC countries soon after we

268
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:03,530
we started looking at them and then we

269
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,900
decided to investigate the attackers

270
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:08,449
techniques and toolkits again what they

271
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:13,160
have been doing all these years and what

272
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:16,670
they have been implementing so first of

273
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,650
all talking about the new victims the

274
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:22,760
victims are high-profile governmental

275
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:25,750
organizations in APEC countries there

276
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:30,230
are some political parties among the

277
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:33,320
victims these are common victims for

278
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,400
cyber espionage as you may know but some

279
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,100
other

280
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,870
industries that they went after was very

281
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,720
interesting like education on

282
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,850
institutions and universities a lot of

283
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,450
universities were among the targets off

284
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:50,720
a spring dragon why because I don't

285
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,970
think universities have I don't think

286
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,390
many universities and care about

287
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:58,940
security that much they of course in

288
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,980
governmental organizations they think

289
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,250
about security and they want to have

290
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,500
security more than universities I don't

291
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,230
think most of the universe universities

292
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,690
have no idea what securities and if some

293
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:14,090
sometimes some cyber attack would happen

294
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:17,450
on them and then telecommunication

295
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,490
industry which is very important and

296
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,530
then also some manufacturers of

297
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,910
telecommunication industries which is

298
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:31,030
somehow going after supply chain and

299
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:37,339
trying to be one step ahead of infecting

300
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:40,459
individuals or organizations itself so

301
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:43,520
this is the map of the victims the new

302
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:46,910
victims you can see almost all the APEC

303
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:50,540
countries are among the targets not

304
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:52,370
Australia and New Zealand yet but as

305
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:56,900
they are expanding the targets all the

306
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,790
time maybe we are the next victims let

307
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,150
me talk about the tool sets of spring

308
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:05,209
dragon they have different kind of

309
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:09,319
backdoors with different characteristics

310
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:13,220
and customized say to servers and

311
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:15,919
customized details for creating service

312
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,920
and creating persistence on the victims

313
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:22,040
machine so it makes the detection very

314
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,550
difficult as I already said because the

315
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:31,820
audiences are not useful anymore in some

316
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:34,490
system the file is has one person unique

317
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,320
name in another system it changes and it

318
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,790
has something else and the c2 servers

319
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,230
are also different from victim to

320
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:45,649
another victim different backdoor on

321
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:48,240
tools that they have are also embedded

322
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,710
inside the installers or

323
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,900
or back door loaders and backdoor

324
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:55,110
modules what you see in this picture is

325
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:59,940
a very old back door installer of this

326
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:03,030
apt actor these are the resource entries

327
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,190
of the file as you can see the file the

328
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,860
back door file is in plain text inside

329
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:12,030
one of the resource entries but it was

330
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,899
back then in 2012 or 13 they don't do

331
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,530
this anymore

332
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,570
they they made more and they made the

333
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,600
tools more office gated and more

334
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:24,240
advanced they have different encryption

335
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,280
techniques and they encrypt backdoor

336
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,130
files inside the back door loaders or

337
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:32,330
back to injectors which would inject the

338
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:36,120
backdoor file into the system processes

339
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:40,189
so it makes it more difficult to find

340
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,189
out what is going on inside this file

341
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,000
different as I said different back your

342
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,820
samples have customized set of c2

343
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,929
servers

344
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:53,370
what you see here is the c2

345
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:57,570
configuration lots of different -

346
00:18:53,370 --> 00:19:00,479
different backdoor tools of this apt

347
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:04,189
actor these are all encrypted inside the

348
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,050
back door loaders and it would get

349
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:09,390
decrypted with the backdoor so it means

350
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,669
that even if you look at the backdoor

351
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,510
loader or installer modules you can not

352
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:18,000
understand the c2 servers because it's

353
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:20,100
encrypted and the decryption routine is

354
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,490
not inside the file it's inside an

355
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:26,580
encrypted file inside this file but then

356
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,920
after decryption they the c2

357
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,889
contribution block is usually similar

358
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,350
from one tool to another tool so they

359
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:37,170
can they can use different tools on the

360
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,419
already infected victims and they can

361
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:42,270
use new tools because the configuration

362
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:45,330
block is somehow similar there starts

363
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:50,490
with some unique strings like this and

364
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:53,730
then after decryption it has the c2

365
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:57,320
servers in this structure in in

366
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:59,850
different tools which is the same

367
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,189
different characteristics that they in

368
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,149
their tools

369
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:07,640
have had all these years they use

370
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:10,160
hard-coded user agent strings so if you

371
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,380
want to connect to the c2 servers it's

372
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,260
not possible because they want to see

373
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:18,590
that that what they have implemented

374
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:22,360
inside the backdoor modules and they

375
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:26,300
have also they use also some custom

376
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:30,290
strings for connecting to the c2 servers

377
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:32,270
so again it makes the investigation more

378
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,940
difficult if you want to look at the

379
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:37,910
city server's yourself and understand

380
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:42,880
what it does and what it has inside or

381
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:45,800
maybe attack the city server yourself

382
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:52,400
but what what are these backdoors

383
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:54,139
capable of they more or less have the

384
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,080
same capabilities different tools that

385
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,340
they have but with different style of

386
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,949
coding and with different

387
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,709
characteristics so it's somehow

388
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:06,080
customized from four different victims

389
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:10,910
they can update the c2 configuration

390
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:13,070
file every anytime they want and that's

391
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:16,480
why we saw some victims that has been

392
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:20,450
infected for many years but they

393
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,030
constantly updating the situation blog

394
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:26,600
to connect to make this victim connect

395
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:30,770
to new servers they can still any type

396
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,980
of file from the system from executable

397
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:36,800
files to documents to images anything

398
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,720
that you can imagine they can download

399
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,710
more malicious files and install on the

400
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:45,530
system so they can they can infect the

401
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,900
system with more tools and more advanced

402
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:51,050
tools and new tools anytime they want

403
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,670
they can load and run a DLL module and

404
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,000
they can unload the previously loaded

405
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:59,480
module which means they can they can

406
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,240
clean the system after they're done or

407
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,640
they can uninstall different

408
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,130
applications from the system because

409
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,970
they can unload any DLL that they want

410
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:14,170
with their advanced techniques they can

411
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:18,170
run any executable on the victim system

412
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:20,330
so as I said they can download new moon

413
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,220
files and install it on the system and

414
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,870
they can execute different system

415
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:28,880
commands on the system to collect more

416
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:30,620
information from the system from about

417
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,140
the files about the running processes

418
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:36,199
about the I don't know network

419
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:39,590
connections anything that they want so

420
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,570
they are almost capable of doing

421
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:47,449
anything that they want when they infect

422
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:49,790
the system let's have a look at the

423
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:53,510
evolution of their tool sets they

424
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:56,750
started in 2012 with with ELISA backdoor

425
00:22:53,510 --> 00:23:01,610
3 version 2 - very true variant story

426
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:04,670
variant a B and C and then in 2013 they

427
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:06,439
introduced another vector module which

428
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,210
we call it shadowless backdoor I don't

429
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,390
want to go into the detail of different

430
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:14,540
backdoors because I don't want it to be

431
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:16,790
boring I want I just wanted to tell you

432
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:20,930
that high level information about these

433
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:23,240
traits and then in 2014 they started

434
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:27,650
another variant of ELISA backdoor and

435
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:30,250
they also used different tools like back

436
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,590
to loaders and back to injectors to

437
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:37,610
encrypt backdoors inside these modules

438
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:39,620
to make it more difficult to and more

439
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:46,669
ambiguous to understand what is inside

440
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:51,199
the file in 2015 researchers from unit 4

441
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:54,920
t2 group they publish a report thorough

442
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:59,350
report about this Elisabetta variant a B

443
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:03,020
and C not the other tools and then just

444
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:05,209
after the publication the attackers

445
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,540
stopped developing these three variants

446
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:10,490
but they they continued using the

447
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,970
variants and the tools that have not

448
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,980
been reported so that's why I don't want

449
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:21,230
to tell all the details about the other

450
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:24,410
tools so they want them to Estill using

451
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:27,050
them and improving them they started

452
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:30,020
using new features to escalate privilege

453
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:32,780
on the systems so they can install their

454
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,810
malware's on the systems with with less

455
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:40,580
access they also started another

456
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:43,040
backdoor tool in 2015 so every almost

457
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:47,659
every year they and they developed new

458
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:51,409
tools and new modules and in 2017

459
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:56,090
they add more features to their files

460
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:58,940
they add more office keishon and on the

461
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:01,340
codes back to modules codes and

462
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,110
different tools that they have and also

463
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,530
to the names and strings which are

464
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:08,689
encrypted c2 servers which are encrypted

465
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,820
with no more encryption and throughout

466
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,590
the years they also added more

467
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,929
obfuscation all the time to the

468
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:19,730
different tools that they have they have

469
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:22,910
been using so after investigating that

470
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:25,460
their tools I wanted to understand where

471
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:29,540
are these attackers based and what they

472
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:33,820
what is their intention so I as we

473
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:38,270
usually do do we try to understand the

474
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:43,100
where they have been registering their C

475
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:45,710
2 servers where all did attack well the

476
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:49,070
malware developers base so I looked at

477
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:52,640
the situation as I said there are a lot

478
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:56,649
of c2 servers for this apt actors so it

479
00:25:52,640 --> 00:26:02,150
was easy to look and sort them out

480
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:04,490
mounted among the countries to see in

481
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:08,210
which country they have been registering

482
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:11,750
their c2 servers as you see more than 40

483
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:14,360
persons are located in Hong Kong and

484
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,790
then some other countries are coming

485
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:20,060
after that and as you know the attackers

486
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:22,940
try to use different techniques or

487
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:27,320
different I mean VPNs or different

488
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:30,700
things to to hide their real location so

489
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:36,080
this is not something very reliable but

490
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:36,860
for for a few years and for a lot of c2

491
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,889
servers

492
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:44,178
it can mean something

493
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:48,559
talking about the origin of the Marvel

494
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:51,169
developers I had quite a lot of malware

495
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,678
samples like more than 700 mother

496
00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:56,179
samples so I looked at the time stamps

497
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:00,399
of the compilation of these mother

498
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:06,549
samples and we sorted the time stamps

499
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:09,860
against GMT you can see in this

500
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:12,740
histogram you can perfectly see that the

501
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:15,049
main activity is happening during the

502
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:18,470
years the main activity is happening in

503
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:24,710
GMT plus 8 times on and then there's

504
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:27,350
another small small smaller peak of

505
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:30,230
activity happening in some other time

506
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:33,709
zone maybe it's another time zone they

507
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:37,309
are doing they are operating in

508
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:39,289
different countries or maybe they work

509
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:41,690
in two different shifts and the second

510
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:44,029
one is another shift in the same time

511
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:46,880
zone which starts in the evening we are

512
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:50,480
not sure these are the evidences that we

513
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:55,210
see and we try to understand what after

514
00:27:50,480 --> 00:28:01,279
that we cannot be certain about anything

515
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:04,730
so just to wrap it up for the conclusion

516
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:08,470
the examples like Lazos or this spring

517
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:12,679
dragon or other a PT's that you saw

518
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:14,990
before this or apt actors with massive

519
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,659
scale of operation they have lots of

520
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,210
they invested a lot in their tools and

521
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:22,429
their techniques and the c to infer

522
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:26,389
structure and everything so they are not

523
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:28,309
going to go a very soon they have been

524
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:31,639
constantly developing and improving

525
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:34,580
their tools and so it's it's not going

526
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:38,418
to be as easy as it was to detect them

527
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:40,370
in the future and then different APEC

528
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:43,130
countries countries and territories

529
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:45,168
actually in APEC region have been among

530
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:50,169
the main targets of this kind of apt

531
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:53,190
actors so it means that the advanced

532
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:56,970
trade actors are interested in

533
00:28:53,190 --> 00:29:01,400
my country's and it's it it makes APEC

534
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:03,990
countries in a dangerous situation and

535
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,180
then we are sure that these apt actors

536
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,850
are going to continue resurfacing

537
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,550
regularly in APEC region maybe with more

538
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:15,179
I mean of course with more tools more

539
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:18,930
advanced tools and more known targets so

540
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:23,160
if you are not among the targets yet we

541
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:25,890
might be the next one thank you and if

542
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,100
you have any questions I'm happy to

543
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,100
answer

544
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,469
[Applause]

545
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,750
you
