24
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:09,800
[Laughter]

25
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:12,410
yes so I when I was growing up I didn't

26
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,630
really have much of an interest in

27
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:20,330
politics my interest in politics would

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:24,470
extend to doing like this yeah it

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:29,900
was pretty basic really allegedly

30
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:32,390
allegedly allegedly we also when I was

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,830
at high school they were around election

32
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,650
time there'd be lots and lots of these

33
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,789
sort of billboards up and me and my

34
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,090
friends would come along and we

35
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:43,100
allegedly would smash them all down

36
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,550
and so in live legalized cannabis one

37
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:54,350
standing of course my father was a

38
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:57,020
police officer and one day I was at home

39
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,729
and this sometimes his friends would

40
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,100
come around and visit I knew who most of

41
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,720
his friends were but one time this this

42
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,210
officer came around to visit I did not

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,090
know who this officer was my father told

44
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,128
me to go and get the door and it turned

45
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,470
out to be someone else's friend but I'm

46
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:14,120
pretty sure because the police had

47
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,710
stopped us after we'd done this and then

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,100
given us a round of questioning were

49
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,260
like oh we don't know what had happened

50
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,620
must have been someone else and beer he

51
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,450
had found out that it was me and got a

52
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,700
new officer to come round and heavily

53
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:30,869
wechat and just got the shuts up me

54
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:34,500
nothing actually happened but yeah okay

55
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:36,750
so my presentation so after that as soon

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,420
as sort of election started involving

57
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,860
computers and technology and I'm not

58
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,209
gonna be talking about election machine

59
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,730
hacking or anything like that I'm more

60
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,370
the social online side of it I'd started

61
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,140
to pick my interest so today I'm going

62
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,910
to talk about New Zealand election and

63
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,549
we're going to look a bit about the u.s.

64
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,040
election how to create your own troll

65
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,350
army how to do this at home and then

66
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,440
some countermeasures that you might want

67
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,960
to take right so we had an election

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,079
recently we all know that and most of

69
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,520
the advertising for that election was

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,860
you would receive a colored piece of

71
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,530
cardboard in your mailbox and didn't

72
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,230
matter if you lived in South Auckland or

73
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,090
why new Oh martyr or in Brooklyn you got

74
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,679
the same piece of cardboard and it told

75
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:26,640
you I don't know I just throw it in the

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:28,470
but they also had some terrestrial

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,470
television advertisements I don't know

78
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,480
who watches that stuff anymore if it's

79
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,859
not on youtube or on Netflix I'm not

80
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,929
watching it newspaper again I think old

81
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,930
people read that something they have

82
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,070
them at cafes actually and you can a

83
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,070
yeah I am old yeah

84
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,769
billboards again some social media but

85
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,220
there was no real direct targeted

86
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:59,760
advertising stuff we really enjoy and we

87
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,070
had an election and just under our Odin

88
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,109
was elected I'm pretty sure someone from

89
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,180
the suit actually did this to Faceman

90
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,460
I've seen them wearing those pirate

91
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:18,450
t-shirts around and talking like pirates

92
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:21,269
that may have been involved so there was

93
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,580
some social media impact on stuff that

94
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:27,330
Cota and Zed comments went through the

95
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,010
roof the number of adverts appearing on

96
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,780
Facebook so if you're in your only echo

97
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,370
chamber with all your buddies who were

98
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,099
labour supporters you might see some

99
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,750
labour targeted advertisements but

100
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,750
there's nothing untoward there's nothing

101
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,370
like lock her up lock her up it was um

102
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,140
it was just like here's some great

103
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:49,230
policies that we're implementing but

104
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:50,729
want to implement so there was a guy

105
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,410
down in Dunedin or there was a guy

106
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,630
called David hood and he was actually

107
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,630
conducting analysis on it so he was

108
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,280
grabbing he he set up some bots to

109
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,870
monitor all the different Twitter

110
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,239
accounts he'd pull down all the tweets

111
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:07,740
and he used our to do analysis on on all

112
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,540
of these tweets to figure out if there

113
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,420
was any one or any BOTS sort of

114
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,630
operating in the New Zealand space and

115
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,730
so this one here just taught her

116
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,440
accounts talking about texts any PR

117
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:24,060
people want to own up you can see these

118
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,670
20 tweets there is another one nerd rage

119
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,770
quantified so he had measured the

120
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:33,210
sentiment around people talking about

121
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:34,890
Steven Joyce and Bill English to see how

122
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,229
angry they were about these people but

123
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:41,460
again a really low number of tweets then

124
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:43,410
he looked at links are so parties that

125
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,359
were replying to themselves and you can

126
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,860
see their New Zealand first is talking

127
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,460
to themselves a lot which is not

128
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,460
surprising

129
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,410
everything we've got here he was

130
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,880
analyzing also the links as well where

131
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,630
people were feeding out to other

132
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,460
articles and yeah not a great deal so we

133
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,930
can sort of discern from that and from

134
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,150
what I've talked to other people and

135
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:09,650
that there wasn't much meddling going on

136
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:13,729
in our local election the US however is

137
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:15,500
a different can of worms so political

138
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:19,040
advertising over there is a huge huge

139
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,440
thing Trump was mocked mercilessly for

140
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,870
not spending money on traditional

141
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,940
television ads like crooked Hillary was

142
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,110
she spent a hundred forty million on

143
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,360
television adverts

144
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,490
where's Trump he's like you know I'm

145
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,050
just gonna go on Facebook and he set up

146
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,100
Trump TV which was some kind of

147
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,740
livestream TV thing and after before and

148
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,790
after the second debate he raked in nine

149
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:46,100
million dollars and two hour time frame

150
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,050
so instead of spending 140 million he

151
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:52,250
made nine million it's a lot better

152
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:54,500
right and what we didn't realize at the

153
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,410
time that were Trump and his cronies

154
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,720
were launching a multi-pronged attack so

155
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,690
it's a blitzkrieg of sorts was short

156
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,650
fast what was next short but it was fast

157
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,090
and it was powerful and they sort of

158
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:11,210
sent the opposition into a tailspin they

159
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:14,989
didn't know what to do and to accomplish

160
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:19,310
this they used a puppet but not just one

161
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:23,120
puppet lots of puppets sock puppets and

162
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:25,370
these sock puppets were turning our ads

163
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,190
like this or content like this or memes

164
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,110
like this how to make America great

165
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,060
again like if you agree so they're

166
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,420
engaging with the audience they've got

167
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,730
this shocking image there and that like

168
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,930
if I show you most of these ads that

169
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,490
they were creating it's probably some

170
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,320
kind of code of conduct violation

171
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,600
because they are horrific these this is

172
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:49,370
them in small format you can probably

173
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:51,920
actually see those yeah but there's like

174
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:54,230
people of Mexican people standing on

175
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:58,000
main lines and blowing up in the air

176
00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:00,680
there's just horrible horrible racist

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,830
disgusting adverts that these people

178
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,670
created to try and

179
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,190
force their message on the Americans so

180
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:11,160
there's a person on Twitter who was

181
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,469
analyzing from what was happening at

182
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,180
there on the Twitter side of things and

183
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,630
how many accounts were getting involved

184
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:22,140
in it here they are searching followers

185
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:24,480
for similarly named accounts 63,000 in

186
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:27,780
99 accounts and something looks a little

187
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,460
bit strange about those accounts they

188
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,780
look somewhat sequential and what

189
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,120
happens when you register a torah

190
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,209
account so say I'm registering Simon

191
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,130
Howard F Simon has already taken will be

192
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,740
Simon Howard and then a series of random

193
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,630
numbers and so if you're using a bot to

194
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:48,240
automate Twitter account registration

195
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:50,970
this is what it looks like so one of the

196
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,450
largest nodes in their Twitter botnet

197
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,470
was an account called David Joe and this

198
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,130
account have been around for a while

199
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,490
since 2013 and this one was

200
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:05,520
predominantly aligned with UK

201
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:08,010
manipulation so they looked at he looked

202
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,949
at what time the account was tweeting

203
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:14,520
from and so seems to be around Moscow

204
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:16,680
time there I doing a 12-hour shift and

205
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,660
we'll see a bit later on that they

206
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,430
actually do operate 24/7 but this

207
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,410
account maybe was one that being curated

208
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,420
like so as there was someone's baby

209
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,890
they've been looking after this account

210
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,839
for a long time and they didn't want to

211
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,670
let any of the other analysts sort of

212
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,540
jump on it so they just stood there did

213
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:35,130
their tweeting during business time you

214
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,469
can see from this picture here that

215
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,260
they're they're tweeting around a

216
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,670
variety of different topics so they

217
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,830
start off in 2013 talking about their

218
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,959
UKIP and then they talk about migrants

219
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,640
and then around the brexit time the pink

220
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,710
part of the graph there they're really

221
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,500
ramping up the rhetoric about BRICS it

222
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:59,610
is a bit of Trump mixed in there as well

223
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:02,490
so you can see the the change in what

224
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:07,620
they're talking about as the the agenda

225
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:10,350
that they're trying to push changes and

226
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:14,000
all of this is happening from the troll

227
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,470
factory or the internet research agency

228
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,560
so this is a picture of their

229
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:21,290
headquarters yeah in Russia they

230
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,660
actually call it the troll Factory so

231
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:27,230
they've got around 2.3 million dollars

232
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:30,009
in operational expenses there's 90 staff

233
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:34,430
working or there were 90 staff working

234
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:36,170
fixed on this u.s. campaign 50 million

235
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,829
subscribers a hundred million pageviews

236
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,779
a week and from what's come out with

237
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:45,529
these congressional hearings they head

238
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:49,360
of around $400,000 in budget so 100k for

239
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:52,160
Facebook Ads 270 K for Twitter ads

240
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Google Ads that we're never tossing on

241
00:10:52,160 --> 00:11:01,579
Google+ I did find out and I said yes

242
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,319
and I think they've also doing a bit on

243
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:08,388
red in buying some ridic gold in gilding

244
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:10,490
some stuff so it's like a goddamn comedy

245
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:13,610
sketch a Russian troll sitting at his

246
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:16,519
computer hmm what would an American

247
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,040
drink coca-cola of course

248
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,920
let's give them a six pack nice and

249
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,009
overindulgent no breakfast baby from our

250
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,719
world news on that that little quip yeah

251
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:28,490
so they were that these Russians he just

252
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,600
what's the American gonna live let's

253
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,459
feed them something sex pack right so

254
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,420
I've got me thinking what will it take

255
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:40,069
to run something like this myself so you

256
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,349
need to start with a good lead time so I

257
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:44,750
started about three months out and then

258
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,790
realized oh this isn't enough time

259
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:51,069
to really make a good run of this and

260
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,069
influence New Zealand election allegedly

261
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:59,389
so the Russians for the US election they

262
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,459
started a year and a half out so you

263
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:03,439
need to create a team get all your sock

264
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:05,540
puppets running tailor your message

265
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:06,889
deliver it and then monitor it to make

266
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,160
sure that your message is having the

267
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:14,240
device does desired effect so it can't

268
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,269
be that hard right so our team so we

269
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,819
need linguists who can write better

270
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:22,069
English than I we need psychologists who

271
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:24,800
can figure out how to tailor the message

272
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:27,500
to play with people's minds

273
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,199
we need the signers our

274
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,550
cartoonists to create the content we

275
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,440
need DevOps to manage all our

276
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,650
infrastructure for all their proxies and

277
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,780
all our nai

278
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,490
machine learning infrastructure where

279
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,280
we're going to start correct automating

280
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,240
the creation of some of our content and

281
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,220
automating creation on his social media

282
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,080
profiles that they stay live and they

283
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,660
look legitimate and then we're probably

284
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,720
going to need some hackers as well cuz

285
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:57,290
everyone loves hackers and they help us

286
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,660
bypass captures they help us figure out

287
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,219
ways around the mechanisms that these

288
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,709
companies are putting in place to detect

289
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:13,760
these types of fake accounts so yeah

290
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:17,150
everyone needs a hacker no no no so the

291
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:20,180
u.s. put together a publication called

292
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:22,720
JP 13 which the Chiefs of Staff said

293
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,609
it's Navy and the Air Force and Army

294
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,770
it's the information operations quite so

295
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,930
they've actually written out a paper on

296
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:32,000
how to plan prepare execute and assess

297
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,890
information operations and this is a

298
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,750
really comprehensive document and it's

299
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,699
awesome so if you want to go and run one

300
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,190
of these campaigns yourself go and grab

301
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,660
a copy that PDF and get stuck in if you

302
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:45,910
do every clearance you may not be

303
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:48,439
allowed to get it though so this is the

304
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,360
information so that so this is how they

305
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,460
run information operations and their

306
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,280
Joint Chiefs of Staff so there's a lot a

307
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,410
lot of moving parts there a lot of

308
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:01,430
acronyms because they love acronyms you

309
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:04,069
will notice here that legal is involved

310
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:06,760
but we we're not going to need that

311
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,760
where we're going

312
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:22,410
yeah allegedly where we're going so this

313
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:25,679
is my organizational structure yeah so

314
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,209
the cell chief kept in bogan here we've

315
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,049
got a content creation lead and they're

316
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:31,649
going to be in charge of the

317
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:33,839
psychologist the linguist strategic so

318
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:38,339
they're designer and artist and a meme

319
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:40,049
consultant mr. mango PDF he's on board

320
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:43,799
we had a lot of beers the other night

321
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:45,839
well I had a lot of beers and he is yeah

322
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,489
he's he's on board

323
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,779
we've got a DevOps lead there and

324
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:51,239
they're going to be looking after the

325
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:54,449
DevOps resources email engineer ai

326
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:56,249
engineer and a couple of hackers as well

327
00:14:54,449 --> 00:15:02,279
and then who else to lead a troll army

328
00:14:56,249 --> 00:15:03,569
but the one in only its just 23 yeah so

329
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:07,709

advertising on super job that are you

for trolls this is a troll advert this

361
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:51,600
is what one looks like this is how I

362
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:53,910
hired Steven so the sock puppet account

363
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,529
creation we need to take some

364
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:59,160
appropriate opposite countermeasures as

365
00:16:55,529 --> 00:17:01,500
well to create this account so fake name

366
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,829
generator' calm was great you put in you

367
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,839
choose an ethnicity you choose a gender

368
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,428
you can choose an age and it will

369
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:10,470
populate all these details and then you

370
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:13,069
can just go and plunk them straight into

371
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,929
your social media account and it'll give

372
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,699
legitimate addresses and workplaces in

373
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,679
their area as well where it's chosen

374
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:21,929
things so you don't need to think about

375
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,939
anything it's really neat when you're

376
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:27,150
choosing their birth date on your sock

377
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:28,679
puppets make sure it's not the first to

378
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,940
the first nineteen seventeen or thirty

379
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:31,730
first to the twelfth because they look

380
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:36,090
kind of dodgy when you're looking for

381
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:39,510
automated accounts or or these types of

382
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,340
maliciously created accounts Beck stop

383
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,690
some family members there too so if

384
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,639
you're looking in a social media profile

385
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,350
and there's your name's John Smith and

386
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,500
there's no Jane Smith and Mary Smith as

387
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:52,168
cousins or family members then that's

388
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,700
going to look a bit dodgy it will depend

389
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:55,740
on how deep your cover is going to be

390
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,120
investigated to how far you need to go

391
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:03,179
with the spec stopping but you want to

392
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,620
do a fairly half-ass job of it so

393
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:07,080
consider the purpose for which the

394
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:10,049
profile photograph has been used as well

395
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:13,230
and the source of that photograph so one

396
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:14,610
of the most of the fake accounts are on

397
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,520
Facebook someone's just gone to a

398
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,408
pornography website taking a picture of

399
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,090
a girl and then put that straight into

400
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:23,460
their profile and like chopped it off

401
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,559
here and as soon as you do a reverse

402
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,860
image search for that photo you see it

403
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,240
leads back to all this pornography so

404
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,918
Facebook can also do those reverse image

405
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,030
searches and then lead back to the

406
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,030
account and figure out that's

407
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:38,040
a fake account protip just flipped the

408
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,629
picture and then upload it and then

409
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:46,860
reverse them and research won't bring up

410
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:51,300
anything also make sure that you choose

411
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:57,840
an address that exists in your profile

412
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:59,820
so a couple of years ago at Kiwi con we

413
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,010
had some ticket online ticket purchases

414
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,580
and this is when we'd integrated PayPal

415
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,790
and the fraud detection system came out

416
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,020
like flashing lights fraud fraud fraud

417
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,879
someone had purchased some tickets with

418
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,000
their their billing addresses one two

419
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,020
three fake Street we went and looked at

420
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,850
all the accounts that had been

421
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,100
registered under that name and then

422
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,320
we're like hmm pretty sure we know who

423
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,510
this is and think middle or someone

424
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,149
flicked off a quick email and then yeah

425
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,100
there was some very embarrassed people

426
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:33,900
that they all their pseudonyms had been

427
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:37,919
unmasked the person who actually created

428
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:40,440
the ad actually paid for the tickets and

429
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,420
use their fake address this picture was

430
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,560
printed out and put on the cubicle wall

431
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:56,550
for him to remember

432
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:57,960
OPSEC right so opposite countermeasures

433
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,210
you need proxies obviously you don't

434
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,440
want all of your if you're managing a

435
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,940
hundred accounts you don't want them all

436
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,430
to come out of your home IP address

437
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,780
that's a bad idea

438
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,190
so you need proxies you need to spin

439
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,440
them up on a do various or something

440
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:14,610
somewhere that where you can still log

441
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,590
into Facebook from burner phones as well

442
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,300
you can use Tulio so Tulio is a pretty

443
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:22,770
neat service we can just sign up and get

444
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:25,590
a SMS number because you want to use SMS

445
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:27,629
to bolster the validity of your profile

446
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,429
or you want to implement 2fi on your

447
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,910
profiles to make them seem more

448
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:34,170
legitimate Tulio doesn't support it's a

449
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,750
Miss for New Zealand numbers so if

450
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:40,080
you're creating New Zealand profiles

451
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:43,230
you probably want New Zealand SMS

452
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,840
numbers to go with them so you could

453
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,010
always create your own SMS service right

454
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,439
then you need basic

455
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,810
can't so I'm using outlook for my feeder

456
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,850
accounts and then creating the Facebook

457
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,620
and Twitter and stuff from using the

458
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:58,709
outlook commentaries as a feeder you

459
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:01,169
don't want like dodgy hacker at mail and

460
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:03,030
a comb or some other like shitty service

461
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:07,170
that's going to get blacklisted really

462
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:10,410
quickly or already is blacklisted so for

463
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:13,920
the 2fa part i didn't want to pay for

464
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:16,890
Twilio cuz I'm cheap and also I wanted

465
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,290
to figure out a nice solution to this so

466
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:22,290
I looked at the some 800 see which is

467
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:24,149
like a little basically a cellular modem

468
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,520
and they're pretty cheap but then you

469
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,110
need to worry about how to get there the

470
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,010
serial line out of it and there was

471
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:34,469
going to be a bit of a problem so I went

472
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,820
with USB modems and I managed I found

473
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,580
that some one on trade me who was

474
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,100
selling ten of them for $90 and he said

475
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,790
I had heaps of them so he gave me 20 for

476
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,889
$90 so they ended up in $4 fifty each

477
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:49,020
some cards again I found someone on

478
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,550
trade me if you go to Vodafone shop and

479
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,050
you want a new SIM card it costs five

480
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,930
dollars I think it's like that's

481
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:57,720
ridiculous so I found someone online who

482
00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:02,760
has got an unlimited supply of Vodafone

483
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:06,090
SIM cards and selling them for 50 cents

484
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,800
each and again I purchased ten or

485
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:10,080
fifteen of those and then it came

486
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,639
there's like 20 or 25 in there and the

487
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,480
envelopes I'm not sure I'm just getting

488
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:19,260
free stuff it's great you need a USB hub

489
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:22,500
as well to run the stuff so because each

490
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,990
one of these modems I think they draw

491
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,030
about 500 milliamps so you it's hard to

492
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:30,480
find a USB hub that can go bigger than

493
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:33,180
three amps yeah I'm not really sure why

494
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,490
I did talk to Finch him about this yeah

495
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,200
and there can be as but as a bonus you

496
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:41,790
can use this little rig to spam your

497
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,770
friends so you can't actually run that

498
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:49,920
mini and hub but it looks really cool

499
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:51,360
fully populated doesn't it there's some

500
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,610
really neat software that's already been

501
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,929
developed for this purpose so you can

502
00:22:53,610 --> 00:23:01,139
just use soak it and then like pipe 80

503
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:04,620
commands directly into the div TTY you

504
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,530
speed zero or you can use SMS server

505
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:10,229
tools number three with all your gsm

506
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:12,030
modems they all register as USB devices

507
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,970
and then there's a handle of the air

508
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,830
there is just running eighty commands to

509
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,910
all the modems constantly and saying hey

510
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,770
have you got a new message here we've

511
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,420
got a new message as soon as it gets a

512
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,370
new message it pops it into a spalling

513
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,900
folder and then you can then read the

514
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,000
messages out of spalling folder and then

515
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,700
like freed them into something else it's

516
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,010
automatically putting them into your

517
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:38,190
Facebook account right so if you're

518
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:40,470
creating lots of accounts using the

519
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,150
mobile version of any site like mobile

520
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,250
version of Facebook mobile version of

521
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,990
Twitter it's a lot more cut down and you

522
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,690
can scrape it and you can automate a lot

523
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:52,080
easier so selenium or grease monkey for

524
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:55,140
that you can also allegedly steel

525
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,580
exhaust accounts from dumps but they're

526
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,530
probably going to get shot down after

527
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,840
but after a number of time amount of

528
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,910
time because Facebook they'll be

529
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,439
monitoring those dumps as well and

530
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,670
they'll figure out all these accounts

531
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,860
have been compromised as it shut them

532
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:15,270
down managing lots of social media

533
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:16,949
accounts is a pain in the backside so

534
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,930
there are some tools you can use to do

535
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,110
this however there's HootSuite and

536
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:24,510
buffer and they're good HootSuite for a

537
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,100
I think it's free when you're up to five

538
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,840
accounts but anything more than that you

539
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,070
have to start paying money and these

540
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,350
companies are probably going to be

541
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:34,409
compliant with law enforcement requests

542
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:36,090
and plus it changes their like when you

543
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:39,480
see posts on Facebook you can see it's

544
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:42,689
been posted by HootSuite however there's

545
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,420
another bit of software which is far

546
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:47,310
less likely to help out law enforcement

547
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,160
it's called monster social it's

548
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:51,929
basically a bot management platform and

549
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,980
it works with Facebook Instagram

550
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:57,390
Pinterest Tumblr Twitter it's really

551
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,500
really neat and you can do a lot of cool

552
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:03,930
stuff with them so when you are creating

553
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,280
these sockpuppet accounts Facebook I'm

554
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,510
not sure what their triggers are and it

555
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,730
would take quite a while to figure out

556
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,290
what they are but if it looks dodgy

557
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:12,330
you're going to get challenged so the

558
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:14,700
account will get locked and then you get

559
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:16,590
asked to send a recent pic of yourself

560
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,000
I've only got one pack of this person

561
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,669
who have used created the fake account

562
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,320
from and I flipped it so I just take the

563
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:25,670
unfurl up version and then send it up

564
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,669
and then my account gets unlocked again

565
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:33,840
using tor fa will also provide validity

566
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,180
to your profile as I mentioned before so

567
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,699
you might when he gets locked it might

568
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:41,430
be like hey we've seen some some dodgy

569
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,290
behavior on your account he a you okay

570
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:46,170
Simon are you still there

571
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:49,940
I sure AM just send me a semester my

572
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,940
bank of modems and I'll sort you out

573
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,890
so the troll factory came across similar

574
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,540
problems and there's a really great I

575
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,090
could only really I couldn't find much

576
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,860
information about the the troll Factory

577
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:03,780
except there's a Russian site where that

578
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:07,729
interviewed some of the ex employees and

579
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:10,260
it's in Russian so I had to translator

580
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,640
well using Google Translate I didn't

581
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,120
mean you ly go and learn Russian and

582
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,430
then translate it and so when Facebook

583
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,439
blocks accounts of trolls the IT

584
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:21,090
department my Russian accents terrible

585
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,360
I'm not even going to try I got a friend

586
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:26,459
to record it but before so they buy a

587
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,040
proxy server issue new IP addresses

588
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,230
virtual oasis and the work begins anew

589
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,360
and also some cards or cloud numbers are

590
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,520
purchased and new payments accounts are

591
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:40,679
open so my methodology is following this

592
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,930
seems to be good so far so with a sock

593
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,060
account sock puppet accounts you to

594
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:47,880
tailor your profile so you need to match

595
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,800
your profiles to the personality types

596
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,330
you need so someone who will resonate

597
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:55,980
with their new friends and to do this

598
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:58,500
I've been using ocean personality test

599
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,210
so based on what you like and what you

600
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,360
post you can figure out if someone's an

601
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:07,200
extrovert or very agreeable or slightly

602
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,540
neurotic people say but by Hogan the

603
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,110
ocean personality test it's it's a load

604
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,260
of junk

605
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:15,810
it only caters for 56% of the population

606
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,420
it doesn't account for thriftiness na

607
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,950
nastiness tanned sense of humor all

608
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,720
these other things but if it's good

609
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,800
enough for Cambridge analytic a it's

610
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,350
good enough for me

611
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,659
suppose you don't know Cambridge unless

612
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:32,020
you are a global election management

613
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:34,930
agency offshoot of ECL group and

614
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,700
patterned by Robert Mercer who helped

615
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:39,640
funds his buddy Steve Benin and

616
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,430
Breitbart news it took me a long time to

617
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,560
find a smiling picture of Steve Benin

618
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:49,540
all of them are like the grumpy cat like

619
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:53,310
down-tuned face it's very sad man but he

620
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,310
is smiling lovely smile in this photo

621
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:58,990
so Cambridge analytic a has between

622
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:01,990
3,000 and 5,000 data points on every

623
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:04,150
American which is terrifying they know

624
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:06,900
their age that income their debt their

625
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:09,160
hobbies criminal history gun ownership

626
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,830
some of its collected by them by

627
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,230
scraping social media and they just

628
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:17,379
purchasing it bulk from all these other

629
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,760
American suppliers as well and they

630
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,410
assisted with Brixton and Trump

631
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,120
campaigns in currently under

632
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:26,350
investigation by the house Parliament

633
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:29,080
Select Committee on Intelligence so in

634
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:33,060
order to profile yourself to figure out

635
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,679
what your ocean score as the Cambridge

636
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,440
University which is funnily enough where

637
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,350
Cambridge analytical grew out of they've

638
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,000
got an API called magic sauce so you can

639
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:45,040
obtain obtained a list of your profile

640
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,110
like some posts and you can either use

641
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,550
give it access to your account or you

642
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:51,100
can just manually get their data and

643
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:52,840
pump it into the API and once your

644
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,899
profile type is known you can start to

645
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,040
friend people with similar profile types

646
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:01,680
and we need to keep this method later

647
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:04,260
for when we're doing a dark Ed's so my

648
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:07,540
personality type of my fake account was

649
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:09,250
organized and hard-working story I know

650
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:13,750
I wasn't even trying to make it like

651
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:18,520
that I just knew just knew it also

652
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:23,410
estimated that my profile age type as 12

653
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,410
[Applause]

654
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:35,649
it's mainly because I was doing what

655
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:37,179
kind of cat are you surveys so centers

656
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,430
of influence we need to figure out where

657
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,170
we're going to spread a message to so

658
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,800
figuring out numbers of how many New

659
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,890
Zealanders

660
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,330
are using social media is quite tricky

661
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:49,270
Facebook reckon they've got about 2.9

662
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:52,030
million New Zealand users each of them

663
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:55,500
spent visit Facebook 14 times a day

664
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:59,230
washing their brain for 15 minutes

665
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:02,170
twitter has around 500,000 Instagram and

666
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:08,350
ye old stuff comments center of

667
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:09,520
influence we also figuring out because

668
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,560
we're going to be targeting targeting

669
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,840
specific electorates in New Zealand

670
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,360
because each electorate down south

671
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,409
they're a little bit more different

672
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:22,719
where we are up north

673
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:24,430
so Parliament indeed website has got a

674
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,990
lot of great demographic information as

675
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:31,930
well which we could feed in getting some

676
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:33,700
friends so Facebook location search will

677
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:36,670
allow you to figure out where your new

678
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:39,490
friends are going to come from we can

679
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:42,580
see here some people in Gore Southland

680
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:45,160
working at KFC and doing a whole lot of

681
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:51,250
if all unemployed and he spell

682
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:52,810
unemployed wrong yeah used to be able to

683
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,610
use the API to do this but now you have

684
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:57,639
to scrape you're using the way by UI

685
00:30:54,610 --> 00:31:04,120
which is a bit annoying and this is what

686
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:05,890
once the social looks like doing friends

687
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,560
I'm gonna make them suggest every single

688
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:11,350
one of their friends at whatever account

689
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:14,500
I choose now in this demonstration I'm

690
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:16,270
going to be making them add Kai Davidson

691
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,070
I'm gonna put card over since the URL in

692
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,930
the program here and now it's gonna

693
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,220
start logging it's all these accounts at

694
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:24,280
once and it's gotta start sending

695
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,660
suggestions so fetching receivers if we

696
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,730
have a look it's starting to send

697
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,350
suggestions so what's gonna happen is

698
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,000
every single one of these people that

699
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,889
are coming up right now are going to get

700
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,540
a suggestion it's gonna come up in their

701
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,790
little friends box right here telling

702
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,770
them to add them yeah look you can do

703
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,930
this manually if you want but you can

704
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,160
also do with Monster social as you can

705
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,960
see what I'm doing here and I'm doing

706
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,200
this many at once now have a look at

707
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,530
this

708
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:50,260
117 friends like so that was pretty

709
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,480
quick so for every so he's only running

710
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,460
like six or seven fake accounts there

711
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,490
and each one of those has got five

712
00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:00,400
thousand a thousand also 500 a thousand

713
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,930
1,500 friends they all get suggested to

714
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,210
add this new account and then suddenly

715
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:06,310
they're newer counters like if I let

716
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:08,740
their video run for longer it goes 100

717
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:10,960
200 300 and pretty soon like within a

718
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:13,840
few seconds we've got 500 friends on

719
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,120
that account and so the ability to ramp

720
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,189
up and create your sock puppet army once

721
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,409
you've got a few feeder accounts you can

722
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,440
just start going nuts it's ridiculous

723
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:27,100
and that's just that suggests a friend

724
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,650
feature of Facebook hurting your straps

725
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:33,250
so one of the fake accounts I was

726
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:35,230
running I created I started adding a few

727
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,060
people and people just accept your

728
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,620
friend requests we all know the song on

729
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,540
Facebook because they want to be liked

730
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:43,870
they want to have more friends than

731
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,970
their friend and as soon as you get into

732
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:48,699
the bot networks because there's lots of

733
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:50,530
existing bot networks out there then you

734
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,110
that the friend will Chris just start

735
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:56,350
flying and so one morning I had added

736
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:58,479
some people with um or some BOTS

737
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:00,100
effectively and then they had then

738
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,600
suggested out to their bot network say

739
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,699
this person's accepting these friend

740
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,560
requests and then like a next morning I

741
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,590
wake up and there's like 228 new

742
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,450
requests in 219 and then if I add all of

743
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,760
those to my account then I'll have 500

744
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,530
new friend requests and within a period

745
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,230
of a week you can probably get to the

746
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:22,330
5,000 free and limit pretty bloody

747
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:24,580
quickly creation of content so program

748
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:26,560
voter who's ocean score ranked some

749
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,149
higher neuroticism could see storm

750
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,389
clouds in a threat the Dimmick

751
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:32,890
wants to take its guns away so we want

752
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,470
to create content like that we want to

753
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:39,700
make people scared and so Facebook

754
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:41,350
allegedly so Facebook split-testing

755
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,000
helps you do this they help you tester

756
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:44,290
for an ads see what kind of impact

757
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,460
they're going to have and see who's

758
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:52,330
going to click on stuff and do things so

759
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:54,670
the Hilton Hotel chain use this exact

760
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:57,280
technique to run some adverts that they

761
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:59,590
were doing to see which types of people

762
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,410
were clicking on ads and so if you've

763
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:04,959
got someone with high extraversion

764
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:06,820
they're and they're very open and keen

765
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,290
on doing things then let's give them an

766
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,940
ad with someone's like whacking a

767
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,190
volleyball and outside with their shirt

768
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,899
off and like high-fives all around

769
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,280
and then if someone's very agreeable

770
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:16,210
they're probably won an ad were you

771
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,230
wearing a cardigan

772
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:22,540
you've got like some you've got like a

773
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,800
family situation and things are a lot

774
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,570
more relaxed

775
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:32,500
none of this energetic like jumping in

776
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:34,780
volleyball stuff so we don't really want

777
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,850
to leave a financial trail so if I can

778
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,409
get some free campaigns I will and every

779
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,779
now and again like my Google inbox is

780
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,220
saying hey here's some more adwords or

781
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:46,600
free edward campaigns and there'll be

782
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:49,928
for like $150 so you want to jump on as

783
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,730
many of those as you can but direct

784
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:53,710
marketing via posting of contents the

785
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:59,350
way to go as well so using your follower

786
00:34:53,710 --> 00:35:01,510
base to push your particular message you

787
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:03,790
want to send different adverts to or

788
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:05,560
dark advertising as a concept of sending

789
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:08,350
different adverts to different target

790
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,350
audience groups will be disadvantageous

791
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:13,720
for a group a to see group these ads so

792
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:15,880
the way to do that to target it directly

793
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,009
is using that magic sauce again we're

794
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,230
going to harvest air targets likes via

795
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:22,450
scraping which will give us their ocean

796
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,340
personality type plugged into magic

797
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,080
sauce and target them directly so the

798
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,430
way cambridge and love could do this is

799
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,590
there have you ever seen those

800
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:32,379
personality tests or see what topic 8

801
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,940
a.m. they run a lot of those campaigns

802
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,250
and they have a store that information

803
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,280
they've already got your profile ID and

804
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:41,570
that's how they figure this stuff out so

805
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,130
we're just going to do it manually and

806
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,170
again using the mobile version of the

807
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,640
site this is what someone's likes look

808
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,290
like on the mobile version and then you

809
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,279
can just take all the href links and

810
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:55,370
you've got all the likes simple and then

811
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,210
we wait so we measure it so IBM Watson's

812
00:35:55,370 --> 00:36:01,370
got the natural language API which does

813
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,130
nearly mystic programming stuff and

814
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:06,230
figures out sentiment emotion keywords

815
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,520
and entities so you can as you campaigns

816
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,410
running you can see how people are

817
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,110
talking about it and measure how

818
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:17,600
effective it is becoming then go and

819
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:20,480
adapt your message and get rolling all

820
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,430
right so this is all bad what kind of

821
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,710
countermeasures can we take always like

822
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,240
like having an idea of like how we can

823
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:29,960
possibly fix this horrible horrible

824
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,939
situation so we're building these

825
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,470
Silicon Valley platforms that set up to

826
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:38,750
optimize for self radical a

827
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:40,910
radicalization the way forward is for US

828
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,400
citizens of the internet and that's what

829
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,500
we all are to educate ourselves and

830
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,020
their families that what we're seeing

831
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:51,350
through Facebook newsfeed is created

832
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:53,600
with it as by human or computer and to

833
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:55,940
understand the difference between an ad

834
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,580
and our organic story from your friends

835
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,930
it's something and sometimes it's hard

836
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:04,580
to tell that's a lovely sentiment met

837
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,839
but that made me cry rainbow tears of

838
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,009
laughter because it's just not going to

839
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,590
happen we're not gonna be able to tell

840
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,390
everyone hey like you know Facebook's

841
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,650
bared and like we shouldn't listen to

842
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:15,770
these ads we don't know if they're real

843
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:19,720
or not we need a stronger approach I

844
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:22,009
think regulators like their literal

845
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,330
Electoral Commission would always be

846
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:26,360
playing catch-up when it came to

847
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:27,860
regulating emerging technology so we

848
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,250
can't sort of regulate our way out of

849
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,250
this problem

850
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,930
long term maybe this is something we

851
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:37,430
need to look at as a society and say

852
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,230
well if this is our view of the world

853
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:41,839
and it's been controlled by some

854
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:44,060
publicly listed company in California do

855
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,220
we want some control of some

856
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:50,299
transparency around that very wise word

857
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,919
from the goat farm so Facebook made

858
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,750
forty four billion dollars in ad revenue

859
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,590
in the past two years

860
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:59,420
that's an obscene amount of money

861
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:01,940
the famous Patrick Kate gray said

862
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:04,460
they've replaced human creation with

863
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:07,340
automated creation to fix this need to

864
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:09,860
fundamentally change the model which is

865
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,390
right and they interviewed a lady on her

866
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,910
show who said you can still be super

867
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:16,700
wealthy but not minting at that current

868
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:18,470
speed they have been minting at the

869
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,569
speed and not paying for any of the

870
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:22,160
externalities involved in it you

871
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,750
wouldn't let a company do something just

872
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,250
because they're used to making a lot of

873
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,850
money unless you're a shareholder of

874
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:30,770
course then you can keep going maybe

875
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:33,799
they aren't meant to be this profitable

876
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:35,450
right maybe instead of making forty four

877
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,400
billion dollars maybe they could just

878
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:40,160
make twenty billion dollars and do a

879
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:44,240
better job of curating the ads that come

880
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:47,060
on their platform there's a German

881
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,100
outfit called who targets not me and

882
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:52,130
they tell you which political campaigns

883
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,450
used arcades and micro targeting to

884
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,760
influence your vote and they do this

885
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:57,560
with a browser and Sten ssin that

886
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,330
collects all your ads that are coming on

887
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,470
the Facebook platform they feed it into

888
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:05,509
a big machine learning AI thing and and

889
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:08,029
figure out what what's going on and I

890
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:10,910
was messaging them on Twitter last night

891
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:12,500
saying hey and this is a Chindi pipes

892
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,299
about this as well what about if they

893
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,270
took all those ads and they saw that

894
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:19,070
they were their dodgy effectively if

895
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:22,100
they just feed that straight back into

896
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:23,720
Facebook is into a reporting mechanism

897
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:30,290
and then make it Facebook's problem

898
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:31,879
again there's a German Marshall Fund so

899
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,880
the Germans have really forward-thinking

900
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,550
in this space they actually I've got a

901
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,140
good sense of democracy I suppose and

902
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:43,280
they want to make sure that it is

903
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:45,470
secured so they're monitoring around 600

904
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,420
Twitter accounts a link to the the

905
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:50,450
Russian influence operations at the

906
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:52,100
moment and they're figuring out what

907
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:54,740
topics are talking about what type of

908
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:57,410
hashtags are posting URLs that they're

909
00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:00,439
sending out yeah they're doing a really

910
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:02,240
neat job of this but 602 lyric ants is

911
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:05,360
only the tip of the iceberg where we saw

912
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:09,850
before there was 63,000 accounts that

913
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,850
were splitting out this this news

914
00:40:10,499 --> 00:40:14,189
there's the Facebook ad police so

915
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,839
Facebook of recently this was off the

916
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:19,049
back of the congressional hearings into

917
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,910
the how Russia was manipulating the

918
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:23,369
elections so they've hired two hundred

919
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:26,549
and fifty people now to police adverts

920
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:28,109
on the site they're notifying tens of

921
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:30,569
millions of users this is just the other

922
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:32,308
day they put out the statement so if you

923
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:35,369
have liked or followed one of those

924
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:37,469
Russian influence accounts they're going

925
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:39,839
to notify you and say hey Simon

926
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:43,640
by the way member their ad you saw six

927
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,640
months ago well that was the Russians

928
00:40:43,939 --> 00:40:49,319
and they're also implementing mechanisms

929
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:53,069
to detect fake news so AI manual

930
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:55,969
fact-checking so they it's a small a

931
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:59,699
small step but hopefully we'll see this

932
00:40:55,969 --> 00:41:00,719
capability grow Twitter as well doing a

933
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:02,910
great job as always

934
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,439
and everyone celebrates the two hundred

935
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:10,140
eighty characters meanwhile Twitter

936
00:41:04,439 --> 00:41:14,879
verified another white supremacist so

937
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:18,029
what can we do delete Facebook delete

938
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,559
Twitter go outside and play in the

939
00:41:18,029 --> 00:41:25,109
sunshine yeah I don't know I think that

940
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:27,029
yeah forcing these big companies to do

941
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:30,449
better is what we need to do make this

942
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:33,199
money do better curate this content and

943
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:35,309
and stop this from happening again

944
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,589
because there's a war out there old

945
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:39,269
friend a world war it's not about who

946
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:43,170
got the most bullets it's about who

947
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:46,910
controls the information so I will be

948
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,910
running for the 2021 election

949
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,100
good thank you

950
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:05,969
[Applause]
