1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:12,240
hey guys I'm John I'm a conference

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,830
virgin and feel like an imposter to

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,329
InfoSec things I don't do cyber sick

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,490
things I think that's just people trying

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,810
to trick execs to get predictive wrong

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,130
on their phones

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:26,799
I'm from Tech Ron we make a GPS Hardware

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,590
product a little bit boring but it is in

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,200
critical infrastructure and a lot of

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,239
power and why that's important is you

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,090
need to know the time everywhere in the

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,390
grid so that we don't lose power that's

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,460
to do with phase angle measurement this

14
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,380
came from a thing that actually happened

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:49,210
there's a bit of a development for

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:51,610
talked about we made this product and we

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,559
gave it a 10 year warranty to compete in

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,290
the market for an electronic piece of

19
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,809
hardware and to anyone who does hardware

20
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,100
development that's insane but we

21
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,959
actually did make a pretty good product

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,689
and it does stick around a long time the

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,329
problem with this is that the employment

24
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:11,350
at substations doesn't stick around as

25
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:13,538
long and we had someone I feel like

26
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,240
after the BM og talk that I should

27
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:17,380
probably either thrown cats or my team

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,929
actually said there was a lack of cats

29
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,229
in my talk so maybe I'll just like

30
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:26,490
switch this up and say cat engineers

31
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:29,499
which result in substation engineers

32
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,449
they have some problems and their

33
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:36,158
problems are in Vietnam who buy a clock

34
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,060
they heck through a whole lot of Bush to

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,130
get to a substation

36
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,469
to a clock that's been working for five

37
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,449
years and not because the clocks not

38
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:47,169
working but we've decided to add a new

39
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:49,689
second and this leap second is a big

40
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:52,270
huge problem for everyone who has timing

41
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:54,490
problems so to do that you have to

42
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,469
upgrade the clock and to have any piece

43
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,229
of equipment and critical infrastructure

44
00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:01,329
it needs to be encrypted firmware and to

45
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:03,999
upgrade the firmware to include the

46
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:06,449
update sleep second you didn't need to

47
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:12,880
know what the administrator password is

48
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:15,010
unfortunately we had some catch engineer

49
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,350
ring us up and cat engineer said

50
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,010
mistakes were made and we have lost the

51
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,239
password

52
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:24,548
you haven't had to touch the clock for

53
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:29,140
five years so we I'm gonna talk about

54
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:31,750
quickly how admin password is lost and

55
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,970
that's pretty understandable how do we

56
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,799
actually implement a reset on something

57
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:39,370
that's so critical to infrastructure and

58
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:41,650
do it safely and this is a bit of a kind

59
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:45,970
of what we had to go through and funny

60
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:50,230
story long way the thing we do is we

61
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:53,019
take an aerial GPS time stamp and we

62
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:57,730
distribute it on an old 1950s standard

63
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:59,590
called IRB and IRB is a pulse per second

64
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,768
with a bit code in it and a pulse

65
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,180
modulated width and NTP which should be

66
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:06,040
really familiar with what you might not

67
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,470
be familiar with is precision time

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,720
protocol or PT P and that's like

69
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,280
broadcast NTP with hardware stamping and

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,840
error calculation through the network

71
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,370
and it's really fast it's amazing and

72
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,530
sure learn about it because it's coming

73
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,510
and ieds here aren't things that explode

74
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,040
called intelligent electronic devices

75
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:26,980
and they were been around for a long

76
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,410
time in substations yeah one of the

77
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,608
biggest problems of why we lose

78
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,160
passwords and substations and critical

79
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:35,319
infrastructure is that clients usually

80
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,049
kind of set these things and they kind

81
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,429
of forget about them this is because the

82
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,680
really big million-dollar pieces of

83
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,750
equipment that live in substations kind

84
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,370
of get set once that configuration kind

85
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,199
of gets saved somewhere and then they

86
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,180
don't touch up for years and years a lot

87
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,639
of assets and critical infrastructure

88
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,489
and this goes for protection control of

89
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:59,109
you know traffic light systems and big

90
00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:01,329
water gas power they all kind of rely on

91
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:03,040
standards and once those things are set

92
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:04,299
and how the company wants to use them as

93
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,108
security policies they kind of don't

94
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:10,030
touch them to change anything you need

95
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:12,430
administrator privileges and a lot of

96
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,889
people don't give that out willing it

97
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,959
will be a few people at the top maybe he

98
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:18,639
locked in a safe somewhere rather than

99
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,750
that is usually a supervisor or

100
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,280
engineering permissions control things

101
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,039
because the device is encrypted

102
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,530
traditionally what they had to do like

103
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:31,229
our pork engineer was seen the unit back

104
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,510
from wherever it was in the world and

105
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,830
manufacture than hearing he's on there

106
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,140
to ship them back to New Zealand to get

107
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,169
reflashed which is a big problem for

108
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,550
them there was one case where they

109
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,680
literally had to have a substation

110
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,260
powered down until we reflashed

111
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,590
the reset the admin password and sent

112
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,490
the clock back urgently Freight just so

113
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,690
that we could get things running again

114
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,200
time sink is really critical to

115
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:01,200
protection and control and anything we

116
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,090
do change in this is really heavily

117
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,710
scrutinized by a client so they'll send

118
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:12,210
them to testing and they'll try and

119
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:15,150
break them so so there's a bit of a talk

120
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,010
but one of the things that we did was we

121
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,890
were deciding on how to do this like one

122
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,690
of the ideas here was maybe they could

123
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,120
ring up and we give them a special code

124
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,920
and would reset the device but what we

125
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,570
did is we did a little internal test we

126
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,420
rang up our admin to try and get some

127
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,000
information and much to their disgust

128
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,500
our cat engineers were very upset that

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,420
someone was trying to ask for a really

130
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,350
sensitive information and we were just

131
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,340
like yeah there's a chance there that

132
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,130
you know if someone could just kind of

133
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,049
hack us through a social engineering we

134
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,890
talked about maybe downloading a special

135
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,690
arming device on arming software for the

136
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,099
device and then we'd have to deal with

137
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,690
all the security vulnerabilities with

138
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,300
that and we're just like now we're not

139
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,700
going a lot of these systems from

140
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,050
talking about a usually air-gapped hence

141
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,710
why they kind of need this time

142
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:08,730
synchronization there are some dos data

143
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:11,190
centers who use this in saying that that

144
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:15,210
market and industry is changing a lot as

145
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:17,340
everything goes to IOT and that's so

146
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,830
what we did find out about our clients

147
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,960
is to be on-site in front of some power

148
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,880
stuff you had there's a lot of things

149
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,020
that have happened they know you're on

150
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,820
site you've probably made a phone call

151
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,409
and there's a lot of alarm bells ringing

152
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,719
as soon as you open the door

153
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,640
we decided that having physical ask

154
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,950
access to the device was a really good

155
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,430
way of kind of handling this and so we

156
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:40,770
decided that we wanted three things we

157
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,560
wanted to be able to do an arming and

158
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,090
have an opportunity to not waste your

159
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,480
power station or at least

160
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:50,969
alarm everything in it do a power cycle

161
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,699
and very importantly nuke all the RAM we

162
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,620
use static Ram in our devices and that's

163
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,440
changing an industry a lot of devices

164
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,600
are using app on chip which means a lot

165
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,610
of denote dynamic RAM and there's a lot

166
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,380
of issues of that but at least in our

167
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,870
fortunate case we could just nuke the

168
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,240
whole static section and be like sweet

169
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,580
we've lost everything and the reason for

170
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,889
that is because our clients would be

171
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,400
buying multiple of our devices going

172
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:19,580
into substations they put one in and

173
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,630
then in about five years they decide to

174
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,310
move it somewhere else so they'll put

175
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,810
another one in there grab it out put it

176
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,580
in the back of the van someone could

177
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,580
grab it someone could hook up our

178
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,500
software and start if you did a reset

179
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,260
and still saw the configuration you

180
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,570
learn a lot about how that power utility

181
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,300
or water utility used their internal

182
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:42,539
network structure so we decided that had

183
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:45,210
to be wiped so we came up with arming

184
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:47,550
the reset took you to be in front of the

185
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,810
device you did a power cycle which

186
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,180
raises a whole bunch of alarms in the

187
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,100
system already raises everything and the

188
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,310
client then reconfigures it with their

189
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,780
new admin password which is amazing for

190
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,280
our clients because they now no longer

191
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:04,710
have to send the device back to us to

192
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,780
get reset yeah so the things we learned

193
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,810
probably is the best thing at this point

194
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,900
the things we learnt in protection and

195
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,970
control is that there's already a lot of

196
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,789
layers of security and what we're seeing

197
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,590
right now is IT rooms are getting really

198
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:22,380
involved in the design process of

199
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,909
critical infrastructure not so much in

200
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,889
the US but the rest of the world and

201
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,620
things are getting really connected and

202
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:30,510
smart probably about 10 15 years ago

203
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,580
NTP and the substation was unheard of

204
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,218
but we're seeing that really common now

205
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:38,700
and with the event of PTP precision time

206
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:42,240
protocol and redundant protocols like

207
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,130
PRP we're seeing that fiber is going to

208
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,870
be everywhere you guys are probably

209
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,300
going to be touching stuff that is the

210
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,279
exact same thing inside protection and

211
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,069
control systems which is really

212
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,959
interesting at the same time for us it's

213
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,450
a huge question of how we develop around

214
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:02,660
there sorry that was a pretty small

215
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:07,419
but yeah hobo is interesting

216
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,419
