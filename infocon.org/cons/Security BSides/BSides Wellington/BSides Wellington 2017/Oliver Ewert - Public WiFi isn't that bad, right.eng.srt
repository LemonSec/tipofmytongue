1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:12,040
cool so my name is ollie I'm here to

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:13,450
talk about public Wi-Fi like I said my

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,160
name is Ollie you can find me on

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,799
anywhere that I want to be found on the

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:22,330
Internet Holly the ninja for a day job

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,420
I'm a graduate security engineer at zero

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:27,339
but I'm this this talks my undoing and

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,720
my opinions are my own and if I get in

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,540
trouble it's my own fault so I've been

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:42,399
told

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:44,800
so the reason this came about was so the

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,440
reason this came about was I sort of

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,640
used to have an interest and Wi-Fi when

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,339
I was a high school and my mum had

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,600
dial-up and I wanted faster internet so

16
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:57,819
I took an interest and my neighbor's

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,989
Wi-Fi and then we got broadband at some

18
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:01,800
point and I stopped worrying about it

19
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:05,940
went to university had other problems

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,320
bigger things to research and then

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,030
earlier this year I went overseas and

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,389
before I went overseas I thought about

23
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,280
you know what as a security person I was

24
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,200
kind of concerned taking my laptop

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,460
overseas using dodgy internet

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,430
connections and what I should do to keep

27
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,929
myself safe and then I decided before I

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:27,219
went away that I would submit this talk

29
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:32,140
as a way of making myself do it so here

30
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:35,798
I am there's also some misinformation

31
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,920
around this is a quote from some VPN

32
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,509
provider I found on the Internet

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,340
apparently people can hack into public

34
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:44,469
networks though by definition being

35
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,509
public you don't really need to hack

36
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:48,509
into them you can just sort of connect

37
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,820
it's a public network and sneaked into

38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,900
people's devices sneaking being the

39
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,339
technical term for it so there's a lot

40
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,710
of misinformation out there there's like

41
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,830
YouTube videos of people talking about

42
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,270
how you know people can basically steal

43
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,630
all of the information on your phone if

44
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,090
you so much connect to a public so I

45
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,070
wanted to sort of squash some of that

46
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,660
what I'm talking about today is public

47
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,609
Wi-Fi things that you access at a coffee

48
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,160
shop or an airport or at a conference

49
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,450
hey anyone noticed the Wi-Fi isn't

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,890
working yeah and using Wi-Fi obviously

51
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,970
because when you're traveling and stuff

52
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,720
and you want to you know check your

53
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,170
emails or tweet that's what you do we're

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,290
gonna talk mainly about playing HTTP

55
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,480
browsing the web maybe doing some emails

56
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,410
pretty much gonna ignore everything else

57
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,750
and we're not gonna talk about like

58
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,260
Bluetooth or cellular or stuff like that

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,150
because and we're not gonna talk about

60
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,739
denial of service because if you walk

61
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,480
into a cafe and they've free Wi-Fi

62
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,310
doesn't work just not gonna use it it's

63
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,470
not a big deal we're not gonna talk

64
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,970
about tracking because using metadata to

65
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,950
track people's I'll know the subject as

66
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,480
well and we're not going to talk about

67
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,238
targeting individual because if you're

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,649
targeting an individual if you're a

69
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,920
targeted individual you have a bigger

70
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,060
concerns than public Wi-Fi so also I'm

71
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,619
not really an expert on any of those

72
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,640
things checked I'm not really an expert

73
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,140
on what I'm talking about

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,230
it's the imposter syndrome coming

75
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,179
through that I googled enough so I feel

76
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,220
like I'm qualified to give a

77
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,800
presentation about it so what we're

78
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,800
gonna do is we're basically going to go

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,500
through the layers that are involved in

80
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,660
a Wi-Fi connection each one builds on

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,000
the previous one so you know if you

82
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,910
secure one layer and theory you can't

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,500
get to the layers above it it's a very

84
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:45,390
high-level overview so we'll start with

85
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:48,540
physical stuff so you connect to Wi-Fi

86
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,839
obviously it's going over radio waves so

87
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,840
that's Co sort of lowest level and it

88
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,639
starts there basically so did this year

89
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,410
there were two sets of vulnerabilities

90
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,480
released to do with Broadcom chipsets

91
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,490
which are the Wi-Fi chips in most mobile

92
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,070
devices and basically those

93
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,690
vulnerabilities were to do with the part

94
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,000
of the circuit that receives packets

95
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,350
over the year and their vulnerability

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,210
worked even if you had your Wi-Fi turned

97
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,489
off but hid the location services that

98
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,019
use your Wi-Fi signals to like

99
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:19,440
triangulate try and get a better

100
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,149
location it would still work so at that

101
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,820
level you're pretty much screwed Android

102
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,349
and like it's sort of if you have a

103
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,930
Nexus device or if you have an iOS

104
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,470
device you should be up to date everyone

105
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,850
else

106
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:35,550
Chieko edge security patch you're up to

107
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:38,820
basically patch your stuff the next

108
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,170
level is the actual physical security of

109
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,570
the connection that you're talking

110
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,640
across so obviously if you're in a cafe

111
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,140
or an airport or something there's not

112
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,780
gonna be any password that you type in

113
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,630
you just hit connect and away you go

114
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:53,070
some cafes will write the password on on

115
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,450
the white board which doesn't help

116
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,250
because then everyone else knows what

117
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,500
the password is all you have to do is

118
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,920
walk in so that doesn't really

119
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,850
particularly if you are using a secure

120
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:11,010
connection in WEP has been vulnerable

121
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:12,690
for years and years and since I

122
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,909
submitted this talk for the crack the

123
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,160
whole crack thing came out and basically

124
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,710
we can treat that as vulnerable as well

125
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,970
so in theory any internet connection any

126
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,159
Wi-Fi connection you're connecting to

127
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,840
you basically assume that the the

128
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,230
wireless connection itself is

129
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,900
unencrypted it's basically where I'm

130
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,890
going with this but our main objective

131
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,210
is when you're on a public network

132
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,270
anywhere so we're going to assume that

133
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,729
it's unencrypted moving up a little bit

134
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,219
ah this was another one about crack

135
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,630
Radio New Zealand said that basically

136
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,630
you shouldn't use Wi-Fi anymore which

137
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,888
was the mis-education of what intonating

138
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,609
ins it said I think it was interviewed

139
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:56,690
and said but at least face it we're not

140
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:58,009
gonna stop using Wi-Fi right I'm

141
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,280
certainly not using Ethernet for

142
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:02,539
everything so now we get up to a wired

143
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,448
equivalent so basically once you've

144
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:08,030
connected to that access point you

145
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,350
basically have the same level of

146
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,619
connection as if you plugged your

147
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:15,229
Ethernet cable into the exit light into

148
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,240
the network switch so these things

149
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:19,070
actually don't apply just to Wi-Fi but

150
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,710
also if you're connected via physical

151
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,419
cable to an internet connection and

152
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,388
there's a whole bunch of stuff that can

153
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:29,270
be done at this level you can mistreat

154
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:32,090
someone using DNS if you respond faster

155
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,219
to an domain name query than the actual

156
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:37,760
domain name server they could send you

157
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,949
to some malicious site you can do app

158
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,590
spoofing or up catch poisoning which is

159
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,910
basically also redirecting traffic but

160
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,739
basically saying hey know this IP

161
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:51,830
addresses over there over there and then

162
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:55,849
same results you go to attackers server

163
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,560
rather than actual server this is like

164
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:59,419
host separation stuff which a lot of the

165
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,020
enterprise access points support but

166
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,130
there doesn't really help that much

167
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,750
often it's also not configured properly

168
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,219
I've seen it where like if you're on the

169
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,229
same access point you can't talk to the

170
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:13,639
other device but if you're on a

171
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:16,280
different access point you can and then

172
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,550
this the yacek attacks type thing which

173
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,580
is where you when a device is hey I'm

174
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,349
looking for CBD free Wi-Fi you say yeah

175
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,820
that's I'm that access point and then

176
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:27,889
they connect to you doesn't work so well

177
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:31,789
and you want more because vendors have

178
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:33,440
started protecting against that but some

179
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,990
easier stuff still works like just

180
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,270
sitting up an access point with an SSID

181
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,220
like with a Wi-Fi name that you know

182
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,560
people will have like trade me free

183
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,270
Wi-Fi CBD free Wi-Fi you know or you

184
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,130
just set up one that looks good enough

185
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,409
like the name of the cafe you're sitting

186
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:52,159
at with free Wi-Fi onions and people

187
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:53,150
will just start connecting so you don't

188
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,880
know whether you're actually connecting

189
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,830
to the access point that's legitimate or

190
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,439
not either so you sort of just have to

191
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,979
assume

192
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,669
at this level there could be someone bad

193
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:08,179
sitting in the middle and you don't know

194
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:11,489
so if we move up further yeah okay so

195
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:15,448
basically it boils down to someone being

196
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:18,330
able to sit in the middle sniffing your

197
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:19,939
packets injecting stuff trying to get

198
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:28,198
malware onto your computer

199
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:30,029
scanning your computer for open ports so

200
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,679
network security really isn't going to

201
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:33,029
help you at this point because you don't

202
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:35,279
know enough about the network that

203
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:39,088
you're connecting to to know whether

204
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:42,179
it's secure or not so what can they

205
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:44,699
actually do aside from what I've talked

206
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:47,479
about it's a cell strip what so once

207
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:50,819
you've redirected the your victim to a

208
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,680
bad server you can do things like SSL

209
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:54,870
strip which is trying to get them to

210
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:58,170
connect to the to think that the server

211
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:02,790
doesn't support TLS or encryption at the

212
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:07,920
HTTP layer you could pop up a dodgy

213
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:09,360
captive portal you could just sit in the

214
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,509
middle and see all the data they seemed

215
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,329
and not do anything with it just capture

216
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:18,600
it see some credit card details flying

217
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:21,359
by in plaintext or you could inject

218
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,130
malicious code into a non encrypted site

219
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,800
that they go to and then use that to get

220
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:32,009
to a encrypted site that they can get to

221
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:34,199
and the picture on the right is so eight

222
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:35,839
weeks of being overseas traveling

223
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,040
through Oakland Airport I was very tired

224
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,540
so I didn't manage to capture the right

225
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,740
screenshot but you'll notice at the top

226
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:46,110
that this portal doesn't have encryption

227
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,959
she's not good secure it also doesn't

228
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,240
have the HTTPS which you'd expect an

229
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,768
encrypted connection to have and what I

230
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,300
didn't capture was the other screen

231
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:57,930
where you could use your credit card to

232
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:03,089
buy additional data over a non secure

233
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:05,219
connection and anyone in the airport or

234
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:07,800
anyone near you could you know because

235
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,970
it's not an encrypted Wi-Fi either they

236
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,829
could then see your credit card details

237
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,970
by virtue of sitting next to you with a

238
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:14,189
laptop

239
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,139
so I contacted the airport because I

240
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:18,959
didn't know how to contact the company

241
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:21,479
at that point after three days of not

242
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,518
hearing anything there the vendor got

243
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:25,470
back to me they were very worried they

244
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,759
didn't actually implement it the Oakland

245
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,149
Airport has to implement it they just

246
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:34,439
provide the system and it's fixed now so

247
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:36,929
you can buy internet at Oakland Airport

248
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:38,309
without having to worry about your

249
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:39,509
credit card data being sniffed um

250
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:41,549
there's another thing about captive

251
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:43,589
portals I've got like hundreds of

252
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:45,179
screenshots from my travels of different

253
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,119
captive portals they all ask you for an

254
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,589
email address and you have to like you

255
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:51,059
can tick the box that says yeah I want

256
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,959
to know more about your business or

257
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:57,238
something I think it'll be kind of

258
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,098
dubious from a privacy point of view if

259
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:02,309
you didn't encrypt that especially in

260
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:03,989
New Zealand but most of the time you can

261
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:06,868
just they don't actually validate your

262
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:08,789
email address so think of that what you

263
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:10,379
will unless you're in Sweden apparently

264
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:11,519
they think you and he's like you have to

265
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,079
put in your cell phone number they send

266
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,159
you a text message that way and I know

267
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,169
it's you and you have to put it in

268
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,119
before you can get access but everyone

269
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:21,299
else just takes any email address and

270
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:23,639
then lets you onto their Wi-Fi so John

271
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:27,689
Doe at example or gets lots of emails on

272
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,979
my behalf right so how do you protect

273
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:31,309
yourself that's what you really want to

274
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,309
know right

275
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,989
protecting yourself there's some really

276
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,749
easy stuff you can do make sure your

277
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:41,009
computer's up-to-date make sure your

278
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:43,379
operating system has all the patches

279
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:46,589
applied make sure your browser has all

280
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,449
the patches applied turn file-sharing

281
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:50,009
off so that when you're sitting on the

282
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:51,179
Wi-Fi someone else can't go along just

283
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,619
you know go into Windows Explorer

284
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,629
there's another computer Hey

285
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:57,449
but they've got the documents shared to

286
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:59,459
the rest of the network clean out your

287
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:01,439
known networks list you can't do this on

288
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:03,179
iphone I've been told but everyone else

289
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:05,429
should be able to remove access points

290
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:10,589
so you no longer want to access like CBD

291
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:12,358
free Wi-Fi see it new works to public so

292
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:14,339
a lot of computers will pop up a box and

293
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:15,569
say is this network your home network or

294
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,939
a corporate network or a public network

295
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,799
if you do the public network it should

296
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:22,439
turn off your file-sharing and stuff for

297
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:25,500
you so problem solved

298
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:27,540
and then there's

299
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,510
you can use browser plugin for Firefox

300
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,730
and Chrome and Safari and a couple of

301
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,350
them called HTTPS Everywhere which just

302
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,080
makes sure that you're on that HTTPS

303
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,940
connection if the server supports it and

304
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:43,140
remembers that even if the server isn't

305
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,550
set up to tell your browser that which

306
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,890
helps you stay on an encrypted

307
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,410
connection and use multi-factor wherever

308
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,910
you can like whether it's a Google

309
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,640
Authenticator app or a UV key or

310
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:57,270
whatever just it's just one more

311
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:00,560
security mechanism and it's so easy if

312
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:02,910
you wrote and don't don't click this

313
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,439
don't just don't

314
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:09,120
I've seen people click through this far

315
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,380
too quickly don't do it when you see

316
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,020
warnings like that they're there for a

317
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,420
reason if you're slightly more advanced

318
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,300
you could use a VPN sometimes you have

319
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,849
to pay for them tor might be an option

320
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,170
but and make sure that all your traffic

321
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,050
goes through your VPN if you're sending

322
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:29,010
of DNS over the local network and not

323
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:30,900
through the VPN then an attacker can get

324
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,030
you to talk to them on a local network

325
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,730
and bypass the VPN so make sure all your

326
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,199
traffic is going through it and manually

327
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,839
actually make sure your firewalls turned

328
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,280
on it's kind of tricky depending on what

329
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,190
system you're on which is why I put it

330
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:48,270
in the like slightly more advanced

331
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:49,770
section and if your master was a

332
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,329
believer I have nothing for you you no

333
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,329
more much more than me about this stuff

334
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,819
finally if you're are if you look after

335
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,890
a website of any kind

336
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,120
make sure you have TLS make sure it's

337
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,850
working

338
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,380
make sure you redirect people to TLS and

339
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:08,280
don't let them browse the unencrypted

340
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,560
site EDH EST cedars basically that just

341
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,540
tells the browser I have TLS I will

342
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,930
always want you to use TLS don't ever go

343
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:19,219
back to not using encryption provide

344
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:21,599
multi-factor provider as a free add-on

345
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,450
MailChimp gives you a 10% discount if

346
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,070
you have multi-factor enabled because it

347
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,040
costs them so much less and customer

348
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,690
support tickets so you know provide an

349
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,020
incentive for people to use multi factor

350
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:36,240
and use DNA sick it's kind of not that

351
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,850
popular yet but it's getting there which

352
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,799
is basically signing your DNS results so

353
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:46,230
that something

354
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:48,329
imitate you your DNS records that's

355
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,709
that's pretty much my talk there are

356
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:51,299
some of my references I just have one

357
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:53,008
last thing to say I decided this morning

358
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:54,119
that I'd do a little demo I'm not

359
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:56,100
usually going to show you anything what

360
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:58,769
I'm going to say is how hands up have

361
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:04,920
you connected to the besides public

362
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:08,160
Wi-Fi well I know some of you are lying

363
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:12,868
because so and anyone noticed that CBD

364
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,969
free Wi-Fi isn't working so I I know

365
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:16,350
that some of you are lying because I had

366
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,970
an access point in my bag for most of

367
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,759
the day it doesn't go anywhere

368
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,379
it just has to SSID as b-sides and CBD

369
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,369
free Wi-Fi I've had a hundred and twenty

370
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:28,199
people connect to it so far it's they're

371
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:29,339
easy to get your traffic to go somewhere

372
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,959
else so you need to make sure that

373
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,549
you're what you're connecting to is

374
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,549
encrypted thanks

375
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,149
[Applause]

376
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,880
you
