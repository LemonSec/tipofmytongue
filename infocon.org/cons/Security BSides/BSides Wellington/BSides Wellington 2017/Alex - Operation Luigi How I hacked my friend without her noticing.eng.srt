7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,869
me give a talk here and so here I am

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,220
we're gonna spend a while we're gonna

9
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,720
spend half an hour talking about Mario's

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,749
green brother so thank you for signing

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,369
up for that recently some people write

12
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:29,609
about me and they referred to me as a

13
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,109
hacker who goes by the name Alex and so

14
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,420
that's that's my that's a hacker named

15
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,160
now those are my real name and there's

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,540
nothing I can do about it so just I mean

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,970
please join me in pretending that I'm ok

18
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,500
with it so um before we start this is a

19
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,690
story about me hacking my friend

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,070
absolutely don't do that don't hack your

21
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,930
friends or anyone tell your friends

22
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,340
don't do it unless you use specifically

23
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,730
Austin first and they understand what

24
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,650
you ask of him then it's okay having

25
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,910
said that this is my friend Anna that is

26
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,800
not her real name that's not a real

27
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,199
picture I'm actually several I do in a

28
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,569
trench coat and she gave me permission

29
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,310
to do all this stuff I asked her is it

30
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,040
okay if I hack all of your stuff and she

31
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,299
was like absolutely yes go for it and so

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,310
a few things about her she did a

33
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,630
comedian that's her job and she's she's

34
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,280
she's a sweet young lady oh she's kind

35
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,199
of my age and she's not particularly

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,820
Tecla to it she's as a stick with it as

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,409
everyone who's her age and so she's

38
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,449
gonna be the subject of this talk so

39
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,729
let's do it here's a couple of rules

40
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,110
that I told her about I said I'm gonna

41
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,340
have 12 months to do it I'm not gonna

42
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,050
say when in that 12 months somewhere in

43
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,400
that 12 months I'm gonna let to delete

44
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,899
anything I'm not allowed to like modify

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,680
anything that she hasn't allowed to

46
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,870
delete her stuff

47
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,130
I can't interrupt what she's doing in a

48
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,080
normal life she can be kind of like

49
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,548
bother her so for example I couldn't

50
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,510
reset her email password kasym she

51
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,790
couldn't get into her email and they'll

52
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,890
be bad also it's a couple bills added by

53
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,270
me I have to do the entire thing without

54
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,799
her noticing that I've done it like I

55
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,380
don't want her to know that I'm doing

56
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,330
anything until I want her to know

57
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,670
and also I'm like friends with her and I

58
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,510
like have you on Facebook and I like

59
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,340
friend know but all that and so I don't

60
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,070
want to exploit that information I want

61
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,510
to do it as if it's for real also you

62
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,649
might be wondering like hey there's a

63
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,510
picture of Louie do you have the friend

64
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,270
talked about Mario's brother why is this

65
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,170
talk called Operation Luigi anyway in

66
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,530
the interest of time let's just get

67
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,818
straight to it so the first thing I want

68
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,530
the first thing you do apparently you do

69
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,909
this and you do this is in thing

70
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,410
apparently the first thing you do is get

71
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:15,720
someone's email address so I use the UM

72
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,370
I was recently the shadow brokers

73
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,180
released this tool recently which lets

74
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,370
you do this

75
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,049
and a bunch of stuff into Google and so

76
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,549
I just typed her name into tapped her

77
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:25,170
name into taps her name and the word

78
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:26,519
late in smashed that Google search

79
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,518
button so how to violate the Terms of

80
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,599
Service and it worked we did it okay I

81
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,799
got an email just gonna need that later

82
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,030
I mean I think this is my first time

83
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:38,549
doing all this stuff so I'm pretty sure

84
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,510
this is how it works so but what in

85
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:41,189
doing that I noticed that she had a

86
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,290
hotmail email address and I was like

87
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:44,640
that's that's strange because it's a 17

88
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,798
who's who's doing that he's using

89
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,540
hotmail to store the email that's quite

90
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,040
rare and so I went to her Twitter and

91
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,720
tried to reset her Twitter password

92
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,220
because when you try and reset someone

93
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,629
fast word it will show you a bit of

94
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,670
email and though it showed me a couple

95
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,108
characters and the mail calm and I was

96
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,369
like no this really is her email address

97
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:01,620
the rest of this talk will be about

98
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,209
Microsoft hotmail so let's do it

99
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,250
I also needed to know her phone number

100
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:06,780
again advanced hacking software just

101
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,120
type email address which I already had

102
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,549
and the word phone and normal people

103
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,590
don't have good OPSEC so now she said

104
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,879
she was a head at the head of some sort

105
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,109
of clubs and she was like hey you want

106
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,090
to sign up and the contact here's my

107
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:19,260
name and email and phone number which is

108
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,909
what you have to do is a head of a club

109
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,298
thing but it also happens to not be very

110
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,668
good up there

111
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:27,389
so I also got the phone number done this

112
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:27,870
hacking stuff is easy so now what do I

113
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:29,840
do I don't

114
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,680
I gotta have a plan mister goodness no

115
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,730
I'm done this adventure I've got this

116
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,810
phone number and stuff I got a whole

117
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,220
bunch of other stuff and pasting it into

118
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,690
a Google Doc I think the

119
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,949
industry-standard thing is to send

120
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,299
someone an email with heads it was

121
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:41,940
Heather's word doc and a macro Beauvoir

122
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,370
but that's kind of like that's kind of

123
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,599
boring kinda happens all the time and

124
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,040
like did she even use Microsoft Word

125
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,060
like she's a sweet young millennial did

126
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,198
she actually use it I don't have to

127
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,489
Microsoft wait maybe she doesn't so I

128
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,349
don't really I don't really want to do

129
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,150
it if it's not gonna work so I'm like

130
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:55,649
well we'll start with an email let's

131
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,849
start with maybe I can get into an email

132
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,729
and then figure something out

133
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:02,399
again no plan off the rails so now the

134
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:04,049
next step is to get an email passwords I

135
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,699
can't just I can't like recover the

136
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:07,139
email account because then she would

137
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:08,940
lose access to it so I have to make it

138
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,579
so she has access and I have access and

139
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,810
so there's this great website called

140
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:14,099
have a component where you type in an

141
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,370
email address and it tells you if it's

142
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,750
in a past late list of passwords and

143
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,769
companies who got hacked but Noah

144
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,919
doesn't say you have to type in your

145
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,870
email address so cunningly tapped in her

146
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,340
email address and she was in a couple of

147
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,529
things but the only one that had

148
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,940
passwords was in the only one the only

149
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,860
breech she was in that had passwords

150
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,740
exposed at the time

151
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,240
was tumblr and I was like okay I just

152
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,240
happened to have that tumblr bridge

153
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,490
lying around and so here's what looks

154
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,509
like the format of it is it's an email

155
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,400
address and then a colon and then the

156
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:45,750
password hash but the password hash

157
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,120
format is kind of a mystery it's kind of

158
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,410
sort of only partly documented and so I

159
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,270
read some documents about it and like

160
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,220
okay no it's actually the the consensus

161
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,020
seems to be it's a sha-1 hash and it's a

162
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,460
static salt and what actually he just

163
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,560
said static so it you can't do that you

164
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,590
have to explain what it is so here's an

165
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,370
example imagine that it's the early 80s

166
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,388
and you're storing passwords in plain

167
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,280
text it looks like this

168
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:06,539
and that's okay you've done it you've

169
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,710
stored the password the user can type

170
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,479
the password you'll know whether it's

171
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,159
the right one it works but no I've heard

172
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,639
that your hash passwords and say okay

173
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,470
let's do that

174
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,419
let's turn the password into a big long

175
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,770
hex number and okay now we're storing

176
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,940
password hashes we're doing it but I

177
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,650
went to a havoc on recently and they

178
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,840
said you should salt your passwords okay

179
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,320
let's do that and so now you have to you

180
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,179
add the a dash to the password so you

181
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,330
add a salt to the password before after

182
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,560
in the middle doesn't matter and then

183
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,210
you get another hash and the point of

184
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,030
this is so people can have a precomputed

185
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,138
list of a bunch of hashes and so here's

186
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,090
me doing it here's me following the

187
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,740
advice okay got to add a salt to all

188
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,859
these passwords I've done it can I go

189
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,020
out but you might notice these two these

190
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,789
two users have the same password and so

191
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,650
they have the same password and the salt

192
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:51,330
is the same everybody so even after

193
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,440
adding the soul they still have the the

194
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,570
thing that's getting hashed it's still

195
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,699
the same for these two users and so in

196
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,110
fact it's if and only if if someone has

197
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,270
the same password they definitely have

198
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,139
the same hash and the other way around

199
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,729
that's it what happens if you use a

200
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,800
static salt and so when you hash

201
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,120
everything these two users have the same

202
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,889
password which is one of them which is

203
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,150
like the salt has done its job in the

204
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:11,580
sense that the pre-computer check won't

205
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,900
work but I know these people have the

206
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,409
same password if I have the hashes so

207
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,849
why am I telling you about this because

208
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:19,590
the first thing I did when is look up

209
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:21,240
Diana's email address in the tumblr

210
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,380
password dump and I looked it up in the

211
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,150
password hash was there and I was like

212
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,469
great and I spent a lot of time

213
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,479
fruitless are you trying to crack it

214
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,919
because I didn't know the soul cuz I

215
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,449
couldn't back the hash the normal way so

216
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,409
I was like okay I guess I have to do

217
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:35,280
something else and so yeah the salt no

218
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:36,240
supposedly the salt is out there in the

219
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,409
internet somewhere I don't know what it

220
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,800
is if you know what it is please tell me

221
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:42,630
cuz I still don't know and so instead of

222
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,940
trying to crack the hash I have searched

223
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,770
for Diana's password hash in

224
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,770
tumblr dumps another email just the raw

225
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,849
password hash and can you guess what it

226
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,919
was like can you guess what happened

227
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,630
when I were - in the in the list of all

228
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,700
the tumblr passwords you think it would

229
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,010
be just her but actually but actually

230
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,159
there was a whole bunch of good folks on

231
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,930
tumblr calm who was about 20 who had the

232
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,220
same password well had the same password

233
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,570
hashing because aesthetics whole thing

234
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,360
we know that they must have the same

235
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,200
password and so okay the first thing

236
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,430
I've learned it's probably not a

237
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,330
particularly good password because a

238
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,640
whole bunch of people have thought of it

239
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:18,150
but maybe it's a more than I can win

240
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,770
from this so I took just the email

241
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,320
addresses of those people

242
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,210
so what diners emails in there but this

243
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,920
is this is a list of email addresses of

244
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,909
people who have the same password they

245
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,630
all have the same password as each other

246
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,970
on tumblr also relatedly in 2012

247
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,680
LinkedIn was hacked and a whole bunch of

248
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,960
their how bunch of their emails and

249
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,030
passwords got exposed and thanks to the

250
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,859
kind efforts and GPU cycles of the

251
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,840
password cracking community almost all

252
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,830
those passwords although almost all the

253
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,719
attachments have been cracked and those

254
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,330
passwords available in plain text on the

255
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,919
public internet and so I got both of

256
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,590
those but for the next to each other and

257
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,270
I looked up the email addresses of the

258
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,159
people in tumblr or the same password

259
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,990
Anna I looked up those email addresses

260
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,690
in the LinkedIn dump and so all the

261
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,610
plaintext passwords it's simple and I

262
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,960
found that no they didn't all have the

263
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,270
same password in lydian but most of them

264
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,039
is like 60 70 % had all the same

265
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,810
password in in LinkedIn and I was like

266
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,190
well that's got to be they must have had

267
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,960
the same password as on LinkedIn and

268
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,550
that's on tumblr and as each other and

269
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,659
they must have used a same amount of all

270
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,820
those things so this has got to be down

271
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,650
as password it's probably this QWERTY

272
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,270
one thing it wasn't actual anyone but in

273
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,679
this example it is and so I'm like okay

274
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,229
let's go come on let's go to the hotmail

275
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,030
login screen tap it in doesn't work when

276
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,490
I went to all that effort and typing in

277
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,700
QWERTY one nope wrong password like well

278
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,349
damn

279
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,640
why did I do all of that and so then I

280
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,130
was like okay let's try it on Facebook

281
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,360
and on Facebook it said the password he

282
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,549
used to be have asked about five months

283
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,870
ago it wasn't anymore if you don't know

284
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,010
Facebook it's a website we can keep up

285
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,890
to date with the memes your friends are

286
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,410
being tagged in

287
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,730
okay no Facebook that's not gonna work

288
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,319
so I guess we have to do this the

289
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,760
old-fashioned way which is did send

290
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,470
doodoo sound sort of phishing some sort

291
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,939
of social engineering okay let's do it

292
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,350
maybe this is what I should do I don't

293
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:04,709
know I'm not an expert but maybe this is

294
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:08,339
how socially didn't works like it's my

295
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:11,099
first day okay you're gonna take a

296
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,510
picture of that cool that's all right so

297
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,579
here's the here's the extremely

298
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,410
unnecessarily complicated plan I came up

299
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,880
with so Dan is gonna be doing whatever

300
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,899
she does on the Internet normally then

301
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,550
she's gonna get a fake email from

302
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,350
Microsoft and that's gonna make a go to

303
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,790
a hotmail login page even though she's

304
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,110
already logged into her email that'll be

305
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,699
a fake hotmail login page it gives the

306
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,959
password to me and then after that

307
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,190
she'll go to the real hotmail login page

308
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,140
this is like the classic way to do a

309
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,610
credential fishing thing and so I'm like

310
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,649
okay first step is I need to make an

311
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,089
email account to send this email I'll

312
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,589
send it from house that's not gonna work

313
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,029
has to look like eyes from Microsoft

314
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,260
I couldn't register it I couldn't

315
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,000
register any email addresses with

316
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,380
Microsoft in the title or account or

317
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,680
team or something probably to prevent

318
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,630
exactly what I'm trying to do so let me

319
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,579
introduce you to many friends these two

320
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,589
round friends it looks like they're two

321
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:54,060
O's but actually one of them isn't oh

322
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,490
and one of them is the Greek letter

323
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,050
Omicron which looks a lot like an O but

324
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,570
you know to a computer it doesn't it's a

325
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,250
different code point and so if you spell

326
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,110
the word Microsoft a strange way for

327
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,490
example with these with these horns

328
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,110
instead of the O's looks like a

329
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,329
Microsoft to you and me and in the

330
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,940
hotmail web UI font but not to a

331
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:14,579
computer and so imagine you're wondering

332
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,710
it's just gonna work

333
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,780
and I also didn't know whether was gonna

334
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,520
work I couldn't know in advance whether

335
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,319
was gonna work so I just went for it and

336
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,540
it does work success this is my

337
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,620
Microsoft account team email address all

338
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,240
those oohs and ahhs

339
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,160
the secret is that only you and me know

340
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,600
about and I sent this I don't know I

341
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,980
copied this email from like a real

342
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,750
Markus officer Security Alert thing

343
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,100
which says like oh you know there's

344
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,840
Russians in your account or something

345
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,520
you better you better click hear it you

346
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,740
better log in you better do it or it's

347
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,689
gonna be real bad I tried to not spend

348
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,220
as much and not go to great lengths on

349
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,810
this if I didn't have to even though did

350
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,910
the only thing and so I sent her this

351
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,430
email which says you have 48 hours to

352
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,380
log in in this extremely legit login

353
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,839
screen otherwise bad things will happen

354
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,460
and so I have to do that I have to make

355
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,690
a fake login screen and how do you make

356
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,940
a fake login screen well you go to the

357
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,830
real hotmail login screen and you use

358
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,240
this amazing hacking technology called

359
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:12,100
right click on the page and then you hit

360
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:13,150
this button that's a good fun I'm not an

361
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,880
expert but I'm pretty sure this is what

362
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,410
they doing mr. robot and so then once I

363
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,060
had a copy of the pay website a copy of

364
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,620
the hotmail page it was just HTML it was

365
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,989
just like text and so I needed to put

366
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,580
this on the internet somehow and you can

367
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,510
go to there's a lot of complicated ways

368
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,620
to do this because hosting your own

369
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,120
servers in various certificates and

370
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,470
stuff but there's a static hosting

371
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,550
website which happens to be a great

372
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,140
phishing website I don't know if they

373
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,219
know and so like they'll let you host

374
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,630
your thing on there and you can have

375
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,340
your own subdomain you can whatever

376
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,840
subdomain you one it's got an HTTPS

377
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,150
certificate it's a legitimate website it

378
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,530
has a good reputation and no one all the

379
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,270
good subdomains I'm taken so I was able

380
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,280
to get a good one so now you know this

381
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,780
is not this is not sponsored by them but

382
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,780
you can use the referral code Diana to

383
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,970
be immediately reported to the NSA and

384
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,650
this is the this is the this is the

385
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,560
domain I chose for the real logins the

386
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,150
real hot my whole thing is login dot

387
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,439
live.com or something and so I made one

388
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,390
that looks similar in the beginning part

389
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,190
I don't know if I could do more than one

390
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,220
subdomain whatever course gonna look at

391
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,420
it probably not but real looking real

392
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,560
login screens they look like this they

393
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,420
look like this they have a bunch of

394
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,069
random stuff after the Euro so I put a

395
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,329
bunch of other random stuff there which

396
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,040
I copy pasted from the Google login

397
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,920
screen whatever it's fine

398
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,849
and so here's my copy of the login

399
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,140
screen looks exactly the same

400
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,580
it's actually the same screen job

401
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,710
because it looks exactly the same and it

402
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,910
has her email prefilled in there so it

403
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,070
looks like you know she's ready to login

404
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,810
because their email field also

405
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,750
added this little extra thing to the

406
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,189
login screen which when when the login

407
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,830
button is clicked it'll add an image to

408
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,660
the page and the browser will try and

409
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,510
request that image but the URL of the

410
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,459
image is just a website I can't roll

411
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,990
fold flash to Anna and then a question

412
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,670
mark and then plus whatever the password

413
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,650
is so the reason I've done this is

414
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,870
because then somewhere in my logs on

415
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,209
this and this is like the cheap and

416
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,680
nasty way so it's faster it's bad then

417
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,990
somewhere in my logs I'll have requests

418
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,520
for forward slash Diana plus whatever

419
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,910
the password is so I can just grab my

420
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:03,040
logs for Diana and just be there and

421
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,480
also I am made it so when she clicks the

422
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,829
button wait one second and then goes to

423
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,300
the remote to the real hotmail login

424
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:11,140
screen the one second is to simulate

425
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,280
Australian internet times anyway so I

426
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,660
sent the email to her and I was all

427
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,189
excited and I waited for 24 hours if you

428
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,469
didn't click on it and sounds like okay

429
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,360
maybe I did give it 48 hours so maybe

430
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,950
she's just running late but then 48

431
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,970
hours she also didn't click on it and I

432
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:26,770
was like okay good

433
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:30,730
two times it's not working I'm not a

434
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:33,040
hacker I'm just emailing my friends and

435
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,680
so I was like okay alright let's do this

436
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,180
the hard way I didn't want to but now

437
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,739
I'm doing it now I wanna do like a

438
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,510
really specific phishing email that's

439
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,950
just for her and so I want it the usual

440
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,210
way you do this with a Google Doc and

441
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,380
I'm like just mark is it I can't use

442
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,540
Google Docs because it's a hotmail

443
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,770
account is there a Microsoft version of

444
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,420
Google Docs they absolutely is and it's

445
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,540
called one cloud sky something something

446
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,310
something and you can absolutely use it

447
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:57,670
and I was like great and so I made a

448
00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:00,160
fake resume in whatever this thing is

449
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,370
called Docs and here's the plan this

450
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,930
time

451
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,310
Emma's gonna be doing her anything she's

452
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,260
gonna get an email from a recruiter and

453
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,609
then the same things gonna happen the

454
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,840
recruiter is gonna link it to this login

455
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,880
page and then on the other side of the

456
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,080
fake login page will be this Google Doc

457
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,900
that I've made no this Microsoft Google

458
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,220
Doc that I made that is a resume and

459
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,660
then she'll go then she'll just read it

460
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,920
and be like okay whatever and go back to

461
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,449
normal and not suspect to think that's

462
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,050
very important it'd be bad if she

463
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,540
suspected a thing

464
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,790
um so now I have to make a fake recruit

465
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,140
it's an this from and so I'm here's a

466
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,310
Google account creation screen did you

467
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,010
know you can type anything you want in

468
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:32,130
these boxes like that's what I learned

469
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,500
and so

470
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,839
I looked up like a company and stuff and

471
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,970
found a believable sounding name and all

472
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,769
that and here's the email I sent so let

473
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,089
me go through this so the emails from

474
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:43,649
Kathleen willows which is a name that I

475
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,910
made up and this is from a regular

476
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,470
gmail.com account because I didn't think

477
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,850
normal people look at what email address

478
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,910
things are from I didn't like spoof the

479
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,899
domain or anything because I think it

480
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,189
just doesn't care she just not gonna

481
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,079
look at the domain and even if she does

482
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,329
it'll be like from Gmail maybe it's a

483
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:00,388
personal account whatever and so it says

484
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:02,430
hello Danny's real name trust you or

485
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:03,839
well I tried really hard to sound like a

486
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,888
stressed office worker in this email

487
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,389
because you know I didn't want to sound

488
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:07,649
like myself and so I hope this is how

489
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:10,620
office I hope this is how office

490
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:12,720
recruiters talk and so like hey what's

491
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,380
up hey what's up Diana

492
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,540
somebody has applied for a job with us

493
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,959
and they listed you as a reference and

494
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,219
can you please confirm that you know

495
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,630
this is the right person that they work

496
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,160
with you and all that and so then it

497
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,199
says click here for the resume mm-hmm

498
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,790
and then after that it's got hope it's

499
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,319
got a form where says can you confirm

500
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,519
some days can you write some stuff from

501
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:34,529
one to five that's just to be

502
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,670
distracting so the last that's just

503
00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:37,079
something distracting to read after

504
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,250
you've read click here because it's the

505
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:41,160
last thing you read is click here you

506
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,569
might go mmhmm and then it says also can

507
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,740
I call you about it do you let me know

508
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:45,599
time for the call if the phone number

509
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,220
her phone number okay and then I made a

510
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,990
little email signature its neck you'd I

511
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,170
like what went to great lengths to make

512
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,430
that little email signature anyway she

513
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,750
worked I send it to her and she clicked

514
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,130
on the resume and she logged in to login

515
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,040
screen and she'd have to the password

516
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:01,170
but particularly astute audience members

517
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,839
will have noticed that the password that

518
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:06,180
she attacked into my login form thing is

519
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,740
query one which is the same password as

520
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,930
I had from the tumbler dump earlier

521
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,190
so actually actually I already had this

522
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:14,099
password for her hand

523
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:16,319
this whole whole thing this whole thing

524
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,240
is not actually helped me log into

525
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:20,099
anything of hers so I got QWERTY one

526
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,290
again okay cool

527
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,670
and so I almost gave up here because

528
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,290
here's what I've learned about her she

529
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,199
does not know what I hotmail fast what

530
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:31,050
is because like she just typed the wrong

531
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:33,000
one into my login screen but also my

532
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,519
login form thing will accept whatever

533
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,899
password you type into it so and she

534
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,389
doesn't know it's fake so now she thinks

535
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:42,630
that her password is the one that you

536
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:44,440
just typed in to the form and it's all

537
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:48,040
my fault

538
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,620
I changed the login form I change the

539
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,719
login screen to the fake login screen to

540
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,540
just always say wrong password the first

541
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,550
few times you type something into it and

542
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,780
I also made it so if you type in the

543
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,819
previous password if you type in QWERTY

544
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,959
one that counter doesn't go up see after

545
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,760
typing three things that are not quite

546
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,590
anyone in the hope that when the pastor

547
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,460
doesn't work she'll just unload all the

548
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:11,050
passwords whatever they are because

549
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,340
that's what you do when you like if you

550
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,450
just have if you just have like two of a

551
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:14,679
passwords that use for everything when

552
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,670
one doesn't work you just unload the

553
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,660
other ones that's what you do it's real

554
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,830
and then it then she replies to the

555
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,550
email being like no I don't know who

556
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:24,069
this person is

557
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:27,069
yeah I guess you can call me he go call

558
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:29,080
me I didn't call her and then I replied

559
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:30,490
to her in a different font cleverly to

560
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,919
look like it's a template or something I

561
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,410
don't know saying oh this is the wrong

562
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,780
resume so sorry two exclamation marks

563
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,830
just rest that office worker anyway

564
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,030
here's another person

565
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,320
here's another resume this is actually

566
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,220
the right one even though it makes no

567
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,689
sense that there are two separate people

568
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,130
who both worked with you at the same

569
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,020
whatever it doesn't matter

570
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,310
it just says oh here's the same form

571
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:53,170
again with a different link click it

572
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:54,820
please and this time if he clicks it and

573
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,870
shouts a different password because she

574
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,370
couldn't have typed in the previous one

575
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,540
because I wouldn't let her and she typed

576
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,629
the same thing three times but whatever

577
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,100
and okay here's a different password I

578
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,530
immediately go to hotmail you see elite

579
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,600
browse the elite exploit kit the Google

580
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:10,389
Chrome browser to type the password in

581
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,840
and and it works and we get into email

582
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,950
inbox

583
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:18,570
yes finally that was easy

584
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:23,100
[Applause]

585
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:26,678
see was easy was simple anyone can do it

586
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,820
so got it got the email password and so

587
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:29,919
I immediately try the password in

588
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,240
everything else that I found of hers all

589
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,350
the Facebook all the other accounts and

590
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,429
doesn't work for any of them because

591
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,139
somehow I've chosen someone with

592
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:37,090
slightly above average personal security

593
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,649
who doesn't have one password to

594
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,809
everything or even two fast words for

595
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:42,158
everything and so okay and then she

596
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:44,139
replies to the email being like no I

597
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,000
don't know this is what what's this all

598
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,429
about why you email me all these resumes

599
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,710
and I just replied back trying to sound

600
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:52,720
like real recruiter saying like

601
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,250
basically please just go away and don't

602
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,679
email me anymore all right

603
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,600
please just don't freak out and you

604
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:02,429
didn't reply so it's good anyway back in

605
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,299
an email in in Outlook mail when you

606
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:05,649
when you search for something it shows

607
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:06,879
you the last five searches so when I

608
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:08,768
clicked on it I saw the last five things

609
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,149
to search for know me interesting but I

610
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:11,769
really wanted to search for some things

611
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,518
like say the word password because I

612
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:14,380
wanted to know if they were more

613
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,549
passwords in there but if I search for

614
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,149
the password it'll appear in the search

615
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:21,010
history thing so I went to this screen

616
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:25,059
wrote down the five things that she

617
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:26,710
searched and then searched for my search

618
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,000
for my things didn't find anything by

619
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,320
the way I found the same passwords over

620
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,970
and over again but no ones I didn't have

621
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,678
and then search for the ones that I

622
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,179
wrote down in reverse order because it

623
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:35,769
only shows he's the last five I think

624
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:37,210
Microsoft knows what I've been up to but

625
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:38,889
I think for the user use his last five

626
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,149
so it was fine it was transparent and

627
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:43,059
she probably would have noticed anyway

628
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:44,949
like regular people turn on paranoid

629
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:46,990
people really like look at their last

630
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,730
search history I don't know maybe anyway

631
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,070
so this I've done it I mean her email I

632
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,480
did it I'm done it I've hacked my friend

633
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,908
this is the end of the talk obviously

634
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,960
it's not never believed these slides

635
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:58,000
this talk is called operation Luigi

636
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,620
Luigi is Maria's green brother and he's

637
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,779
um you know he's the one key one of the

638
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:05,320
pair and so why is it so quiet operation

639
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:07,059
Luigi well to explain let's go through

640
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,740
it he's an operation we do work step one

641
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,240
get into her Twitter account but also

642
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,350
I'm not allowed to walk her out of the

643
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,179
photo account because that's one of the

644
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,918
rules if she can't she can't be

645
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,210
disrupted and she got notice so I also

646
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,649
can't let her know that I'm doing this

647
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,269
so I have to be in a Twitter and she has

648
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:22,178
to be in there and she can't know that

649
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:23,710
I'm in there easy so here's this 8

650
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:26,139
dimensional chess strategy I came up

651
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,870
with I went into an email when Twitter

652
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:29,500
reset her email password and I mean I

653
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,239
mean her email

654
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,400
so when I click the posted resetting it

655
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,350
emails email INBOX which is which is

656
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,850
I've got access to see then I set her

657
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,100
Twitter password to this QWERTY one

658
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,870
thing this is like so this is the

659
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,168
password that I think she thinks her

660
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:45,489
Twitter password is even though even

661
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:47,340
though I know it's not so this is the

662
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,600
eight dimensional chess strategy thing

663
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,039
and so I said change it could Twitter

664
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,750
password to that and then I deleted all

665
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,070
the emails because when you when you

666
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,710
reset the password it sends emails and

667
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,700
she can check that email inbox in theory

668
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,799
I should have like waited till she was

669
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,390
asleep to like do all this so she didn't

670
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:04,559
like see the email notification but I

671
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,340
didn't because I'm young and invincible

672
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,350
anyway the next step is to wait for her

673
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,149
to log into Twitter account because I

674
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,530
want to make sure she's gonna be locked

675
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,600
out if I should our sessions are gonna

676
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,710
be cleared and she's gonna like be

677
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,389
locked out of Twitter and she's gonna

678
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,590
have that enter your password prompt and

679
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,090
even though her Twitter password is not

680
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:21,520
quite one I really need her to type

681
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,658
QWERTY one into that box and so I wait

682
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,520
stressfully for head log into Twitter

683
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:27,039
and then eventually she retweets a

684
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,929
picture of a cute dog yes success and

685
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,330
she didn't well she also didn't yell at

686
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:32,950
me hey my stuff so I guess it worked and

687
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,750
also I'm gonna need to get into LinkedIn

688
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,340
and so I'm LinkedIn I trying to dig I do

689
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,570
the exact same process but when I try

690
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,070
and set her password to QWERTY one

691
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,809
LinkedIn says please choose a more

692
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,070
secure password presumably because I got

693
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:45,730
that password out of LinkedIn dump

694
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:47,110
earlier so I was like fair enough I was

695
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,090
I thought I was doing there but I just

696
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,459
changed it to her same password as that

697
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,720
you know and then there's a little

698
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,520
checkbox I know if you can see which

699
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,240
says require all devices to sign in with

700
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,360
a new password

701
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,679
that's like LinkedIn speak for would you

702
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,570
like to clear all of your sessions and

703
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,669
by default it's unchecked and I was like

704
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,289
I'm absolutely good for that LinkedIn

705
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:06,429
don't even worry about it don't worry

706
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:08,710
about cleaning the sessions just change

707
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:10,000
the password great so now she won't even

708
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,309
notice she won't even be logged out and

709
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,360
so why did I do all of that to explain

710
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:16,110
I'm gonna need the help of former US

711
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,639
President Barack Obama this is because I

712
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:19,870
did some stuff to Diana's profile

713
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,970
pictures but I don't want to show you

714
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,129
how real pictures so I've used Obama's

715
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,600
pictures so I went onto her Twitter and

716
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,830
downloaded a profile picture and then

717
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,360
photoshopped it like this I don't know

718
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,070
if you can see it's quite subtle that's

719
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,928
like a ten percent transparency picture

720
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,039
of Luigi on there and then I reloaded

721
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:34,270
that that's a profile picture and

722
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,070
there's no notifications anything we

723
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,710
could do that so she had this little

724
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:40,240
little lady backdoor situation and then

725
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,640
I did that same thing on Ellington she

726
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,360
had LinkedIn feature as well and another

727
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,420
Luigi on there

728
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,699
and I left it like this for like weeks

729
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,500
and she didn't notice but afterwards one

730
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,420
of her friends said that one of her

731
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,310
friends noticed and they were like oh I

732
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,050
just thought I just thought that I was

733
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,450
just doing that just you know for fun I

734
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:01,659
was like okay lucky lucky etiquette

735
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,940
chord so yeah that's a she gets silently

736
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,990
Luigi for a couple of weeks and I'm like

737
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,000
great that's it I've done operation

738
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,100
Luigi but she doesn't send me out and

739
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,930
like I'm practically a Luigi technician

740
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:14,050
at this point and so like it would be a

741
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,890
shame to just just stop here so that's

742
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,950
why the rest of this talk will be about

743
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,840
operation waluigi this is gonna be this

744
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,900
is gonna be a sinister turn for mature

745
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,010
audiences so I don't really have any

746
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,060
justification for this so I'm just gonna

747
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,010
tell you about it that's okay

748
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,450
and so when to LinkedIn and change their

749
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,830
profile picture to be a very obviously

750
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,450
while the we did one changed her

751
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:35,740
LinkedIn bio to be the entire Wikipedia

752
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,850
page for waluigi change changed all of

753
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,200
her schools and stuff with waluigi

754
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,790
schools and to be like mary attend of

755
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,200
stuff and when i do all this lincoln

756
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,200
says her profile strength is advanced

757
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:49,990
you say you're welcome I also I also

758
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,120
respectfully made a copy of like made a

759
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:54,250
copy of all the old LinkedIn stuff so

760
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,100
she could change her back if she wanted

761
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,630
to and so also then I went to a Twitter

762
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,639
and changed her profile picture to be

763
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:02,350
this much more obviously well elite

764
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,270
profile picture and change the name and

765
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,439
change the location and all that it's

766
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,340
because I wanted to be really obvious

767
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,320
and loud like hello

768
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,730
you've been expertly Waluigi my friend

769
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,060
and so then I tweeted out this picture

770
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,530
and then when I sweet when I tweeted out

771
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,060
this picture she replied to the tweet

772
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:18,370
being like um do you like that's not me

773
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,419
that's her tweeting that because because

774
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,250
we're both in the Twitter account and

775
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,750
she was like OMG and then she replied

776
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:25,360
saying I've been hacked my dudes and

777
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:28,290
then I replied to that tweet cuz I'm

778
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,290
also her same

779
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:45,960
and then tweeted out this also you can

780
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:49,200
translate that one from Indonesian it's

781
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,700
the same and I tweeted out this picture

782
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,910
longing for the date of this sweet lad

783
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,890
went wasn't that a simple time and yeah

784
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,400
that was operation waluigi and so then

785
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,460
what happened

786
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,410
Donna loves her new waluigi life so much

787
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,750
that like she went and changed her

788
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:05,700
facebook stuff to also be well what we

789
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,720
do you like to be the same like I didn't

790
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,760
have to do anything for that she just

791
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,440
did it for me because she's into it give

792
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,570
you some choice quotes from her she says

793
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,000
she since listened to a lot of waluigi

794
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:16,560
songs and really got into the culture

795
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,180
waluigi ultimate similar first modernism

796
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,919
he exists only as a foil there is some

797
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,860
takes on waluigi i did not know about

798
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,280
until I did this we also meet up

799
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,959
afterwards

800
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,490
and we turn onto you factor all that

801
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,260
stuff because G this would have been a

802
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,820
lot harder if she had to effective often

803
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,470
on for any of this stuff because then I

804
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,570
would have had to like officially factor

805
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,220
oath codes or like social engineer phone

806
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,169
company or like man-in-the-middle her or

807
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,450
something or do one of the other much

808
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,160
harder things but most people don't have

809
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,330
to factor or stand on and so we talked

810
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,950
about it and she will and we talked

811
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,540
about possible managers and staff and

812
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,190
key factor auth and she was like do I

813
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,450
have to use a password manager and I was

814
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,010
like you know what maybe you don't maybe

815
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:53,010

816
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,870
