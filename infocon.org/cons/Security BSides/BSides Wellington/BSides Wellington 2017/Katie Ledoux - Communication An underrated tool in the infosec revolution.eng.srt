1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:10,959
that am I am I doing the thing I'm doing

2
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:14,920
the thing um geez that intro like really

3
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:16,750
aggressively oversold me oh there I am

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,160
that's my intro slide don't look at that

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:23,439
yet okay so okay actually you know what

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,279
before we do anything I've actually been

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:31,179
in Wellington all week and I have really

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,730
gotten to a backstage look at how much

9
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:37,930
goes into putting together an event like

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,680
this and these organizers are absolutely

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,250
amazing

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,399
I'm also literally living in Erica's

13
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:48,219
actual home right now and like really

14
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,859
did not know each other before I am an

15
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:53,230
Internet stranger so if you're wondering

16
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:56,710
like what lengths they're going to to

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,809
make this happen and and it's also I

18
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:01,510
mean like I slept next to these crafts

19
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,849
like her whole life is besides right now

20
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,390
so like let's give them a round of

21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,160
applause

22
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:14,860
cuz they are killing it and this is

23
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:16,240
awesome and let's also be really gentle

24
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,210
with them saying tomorrow because they

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,600
are very sleepy so getting down to

26
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,429
business

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,339
I thought a lot about how I wanted to

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,770
introduce myself I settled on this

29
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,990
picture you got the preview you know

30
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,390
it's just it's 9:00 a.m. like no one has

31
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,070
time for a resume recap right now but I

32
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:37,030
really did like this one shot of me

33
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:39,130
recently furniture shopping with a just

34
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,590
debilitating sinus infection and I do

35
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,780
have this up if you want to get closer

36
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,729
to the sinuses if you are someone who

37
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,100
takes pictures during presentations this

38
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:49,869
really would be a good time I'm gonna

39
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,658
just throw my Twitter handle up there so

40
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:54,399
I definitely tag me and while you're

41
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,149
getting out your phone I'll just mention

42
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,189
I am on the internal security team at

43
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,680
rapid7 over in Boston Massachusetts so

44
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:07,419
pretty far this is my first time here as

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:11,620
New Zealand is so dope like ten out of

46
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,190
ten I started as a security analyst at

47
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,670
rapid7

48
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,500
and my brand new title is manager of

49
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,910
trust and security governance

50
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,200
to look at my notes cuz I still don't

51
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:25,540
know what my title is it's too many

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:27,130
words so we all know that we are at

53
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,049
that's exactly how it happens are you

54
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,060
kidding do you guys not go to board

55
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,740
meetings um we're at a really exciting

56
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,090
time for headphones like right now we're

57
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,250
in the boardroom

58
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,170
some of us are even getting the

59
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:43,620
resources we need to do our jobs

60
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:46,179
correctly it feels pretty revolutionary

61
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,560
I'm just like I don't know do you guys

62
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,530
know George Washington is he a thing

63
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,100
here I just had to sneak some American

64
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:57,400
history in here it is Thanksgiving at

65
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,920
home but I'm with my b-sides family so

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,739
I'm feel totally fine but you know I am

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,390
gonna to compensate for for missing the

68
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:08,230
holiday I'm gonna have to sneak a little

69
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,820
bit of American history in here so if we

70
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,170
are in the middle of the InfoSec

71
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,079
revolution which I do believe we are

72
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,540
that would make us and our community the

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,790
revolutionaries you might recognize some

74
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,260
of the faces up here Erica gets to be

75
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:24,760
George Washington because again I am

76
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:30,609
living in her house so if I'm thinking

77
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:33,459
about what these colonists needed to win

78
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,200
the Revolutionary War in addition to the

79
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,450
traditional cannons and muskets you

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,329
might expect to see on the battlefields

81
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:43,390
there were also these dudes playing

82
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:46,150
drums and flutes and stuff so I would

83
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:49,208
assume that's part of the battlefield

84
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,680
communication system I didn't do a lot

85
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,200
of research into it but it seems like a

86
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,320
weird place for a jam sesh so I'm gonna

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,470
go with that and likewise I am here to

88
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,920
suggest that communication can be a

89
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,049
useful tool in our Arsenal we can treat

90
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,559
communication like we treat any other

91
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,880
focus area insecurity whether that's

92
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,920
sharpening our pen testing skills or

93
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,959
Osen skills or learning a new coding

94
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,539
language it's it's something that we

95
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:20,680
tackle and we look at as another skill

96
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,180
to master and we take seriously so

97
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,450
communication is admittedly

98
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,280
a pretty broad subject here's how I'm

99
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,789
going to approach it as we move through

100
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,000
this talk we're gonna get increasingly

101
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,200
and meta and weird so maybe at the

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,870
beginning it seems like I'm giving you

103
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,030
really straightforward chill advice but

104
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,110
your brains gonna get super exploding by

105
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,340
the end there we go yep so we are going

106
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,470
to be talking about communication

107
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,859
strategies that affect our jobs that's

108
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,140
great

109
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,480
our industry that's even better that's a

110
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,849
whole bunch of people and also maybe our

111
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,640
whole lives we'll see but I'm getting

112
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,710
ahead of myself it's still very early

113
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,419
that brain is barely on it all it is not

114
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,150
caffeinated we're gonna start with

115
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,780
something very simple a problem that you

116
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:10,590
may have noticed and that is the

117
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,830
invisible InfoSec team so a while back I

118
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:16,310
did a very unscientific survey where I

119
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,359
asked as many people as I could from

120
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,330
different industries in different sized

121
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,190
companies about their experiences with

122
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,760
their InfoSec teams

123
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:28,500
my goal was to look at successful

124
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,380
interactions and unsuccessful

125
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,920
interactions and use that information to

126
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,110
create a sort of guide to outline how we

127
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:41,130
can have successful engagements with the

128
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:42,870
rest of the organization the results was

129
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,620
that the vast majority of respondents

130
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,640
had never interacted with their

131
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,950
organizations information security team

132
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,599
where they thought they hadn't and some

133
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,969
people who worked at really giant

134
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,690
companies were totally adamant that they

135
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,580
did not have a security team at all

136
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,560
fortunately some light LinkedIn

137
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,950
searching revealed that that was not the

138
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:09,690
case but we definitely have a visibility

139
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:12,060
problem so do you have goals that are

140
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:15,180
tied to your performance review or maybe

141
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,010
even your annual salary or maybe you

142
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,260
just make goals because you want to

143
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,930
improve yourself and your company you we

144
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:24,150
are nerd well assuming you are suffering

145
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,570
from invisible InfoSec team syndrome

146
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,830
maybe you'll want to make increasing the

147
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,060
quantity and quality of your

148
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,780
communications with the rest of the

149
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,460
organization one of your 2018 goals so

150
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,380
we'll go over some strategies you can

151
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,799
implement they're really easy and

152
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,420
they're easy to measure to you'll put

153
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:49,870
them in place and then you'll profit

154
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:52,120
easy easy three-step plan so I did this

155
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,570
actually was part of the presentation

156
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,610
that Erica saw I did present some of

157
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,620
these ideas before and when I suggested

158
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:04,360
hanging out with co-workers in real life

159
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:06,900
I literally got booed um which I should

160
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,010
have been ready for I totally get that

161
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,010
interacting with humans and meet space

162
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:15,310
is bad sometimes so we won't spend too

163
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,710
much time on that I will say if it makes

164
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,440
sense based on your company culture and

165
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,820
your company's size and your budget

166
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,460
maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to host

167
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,230
an event or to you know people think of

168
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:30,039
us as gatekeepers that they're scared of

169
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:31,960
getting in trouble with so an event in

170
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,270
informing some trusted relationships

171
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,330
really actually could go a long way in

172
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,700
making your organization more secure and

173
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,770
again well I personally think it's great

174
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,710
that there really is a business purpose

175
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,840
for the company to sponsor an InfoSec

176
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,060
happy hour I know that this isn't

177
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,669
everyone thing and there are plenty of

178
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,870
other things that we can do and the good

179
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,520
thing about the rest of these is that

180
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,170
they're very measurable which again we

181
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,260
need to demonstrate success to get that

182
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:01,300
bonus money so but we're gonna fly

183
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,060
through these because I bet that you

184
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,620
already have most of them in place but I

185
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,540
am thinking that maybe you'll hear one

186
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,510
or two new things that you haven't

187
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,640
implemented yet that you can put in a

188
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,080
place when you get back to the office so

189
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,099
buckle up let's go

190
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,140
number two templates let's say you

191
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:22,420
needed to send out a security alert

192
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,039
across your company or to a few people

193
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,170
in your company right now how many of

194
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:31,540
you have a template show of hands that

195
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:34,690
you would work from and and send that's

196
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:38,470
a bunch of light is all I really see

197
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:41,440
actually um I'm gonna assume like some

198
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:43,510
of you raised your hand I mean this also

199
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,820
isn't part of everyone's job but I do

200
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:48,460
feel putting together template is like

201
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:51,550
kind of lame but I feel really strongly

202
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,040
that when we have templates for things

203
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,540
like this we're gonna send out more

204
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,920
security alerts we're gonna send out

205
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,139
better security alerts cuz there

206
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,000
gonna miss something and we're gonna be

207
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,950
able to send them out faster which often

208
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,750
is time is really of the essence for

209
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:09,850
things like that if you're thinking

210
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,639
about what you would want to you include

211
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,649
in a template I have this handy little

212
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,560
guide that I like to keep at the bottom

213
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:19,149
of mine so I don't I mean these are

214
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,089
really obvious questions like you know

215
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:23,980
these things but it is just nice to

216
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:27,550
remind yourself I won't walk through all

217
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:31,149
of them but for example is feedback

218
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:33,449
necessary reminding yourself did if I'm

219
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:36,940
sending out an announcement or a

220
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:40,660
suggestion or you know rolling out a new

221
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,029
project did I explicitly ask for

222
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,610
comments and questions and did I give

223
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:48,880
them a channel through which to send

224
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,699
those so those are just handy reminders

225
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,800
that I like to have documentation what

226
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:55,060
kind of things do you want your team or

227
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,089
not your team here the rest of your

228
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:00,760
company reaching out to your team about

229
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:02,829
definitely phishing probably violations

230
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,350
of any policy is like the acceptable use

231
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:09,339
policy or whatever and now think about

232
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,920
whether the guidelines for how people

233
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:13,990
should reach out to your team are super

234
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,300
accessible and really visible and well

235
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:19,300
known and well documented sometimes they

236
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,880
are sometimes they aren't but I would

237
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,699
suggest that you know if you sent out a

238
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,070
clear reminder linking to some clear

239
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:29,859
documentation about how to report

240
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:32,550
phishing attempts your report numbers

241
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:36,550
would spike way up and that is a nice

242
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:41,199
measurable stat you have right there so

243
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:43,420
onward and upward two demos how do you

244
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:46,810
make sure the rest of the organization

245
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,510
has visibility into what you're doing at

246
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,609
rapid7 the information security team

247
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:56,290
reports into the products organization

248
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:57,940
we are an agile organization and a lot

249
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,579
of our engineering teams have bi-weekly

250
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,850
demos already it makes sense for us to

251
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:05,380
also have bi-weekly demos to show

252
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:08,170
interested parties what we're working on

253
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,390
we're also a security team a security

254
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,949
company you know more people that you

255
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,710
not have the same level of interest

256
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,720
maybe a newsletter or a blog update

257
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,270
would make more sense for your team

258
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,370
maybe an occasional lunch-and-learn

259
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:24,730
but it definitely is worth thinking

260
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,860
about what you can do to increase the

261
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:30,250
amount of visibility that other people

262
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,560
have into your work and let's talk about

263
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:36,760
how you're using chat applications this

264
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,900
is my favorite one so emailing a whole

265
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,770
distribution list is kind of

266
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,530
intimidating

267
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:43,960
I find emailing one person I don't know

268
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:46,300
kind of intimidating emails weird so it

269
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,560
is great if we can be available on more

270
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:53,829
casual channels like slack or Skype or

271
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,569
whatever you crazy kids are using DMing

272
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:59,850
each other and whatnot so we have rapid7

273
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,200
private and public slack channels

274
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,510
private channel of course to talk

275
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,910
amongst our team in a public channel so

276
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,910
that people can come and go as they

277
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:13,540
please and ask us questions and just

278
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:15,640
discuss what's going on in security this

279
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,290
is great for a lot of reasons sometimes

280
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,449
people join with a question and they see

281
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,949
their question has already been answered

282
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,730
my work is done

283
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,470
sometimes people answer each other's

284
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,540
questions and I just like it to sit back

285
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,870
and watch it happen again amazing do you

286
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,420
my job for me definitely and something

287
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,240
that we weren't really planning on but

288
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,699
has been a huge resource is this group

289
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,770
is made up of people from all across the

290
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,530
organization all of whom are interested

291
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:44,170
in security in some way or another so if

292
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,720
you're rolling out a new project and you

293
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,360
want to sort of get a temperature get

294
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,310
some early feedback on that it's really

295
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,990
a great place to start it's a pretty

296
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:57,430
engaged group so it works really well

297
00:12:52,990 --> 00:13:00,190
for us monitoring for keywords so quick

298
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:03,640
story many months ago I went to another

299
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,260
office I discovered that there was kind

300
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,000
of a big miscommunication about a

301
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,920
project that I was working on and

302
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,460
responsible for making sure people knew

303
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:15,250
about no but I worked it out in person

304
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:19,120
not a big deal next thing I did was I

305
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:21,580
set up a I monitored for the name of

306
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,380
that project in our public slack

307
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,190
channels so that whatever people were

308
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,560
talking about it

309
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,850
I could make sure that their questions

310
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,699
were getting answered and they had all

311
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:35,170
up to date information and I think that

312
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:37,450
was a pretty good move we also can

313
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,610
integrate and automate I mean these are

314
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,890
favorite things to do right we can go

315
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,870
above and beyond just monitoring for

316
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,360
mentions and we can actually have slack

317
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,920
bots do our jobs for us this is

318
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,360
something my team is building out right

319
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,699
now hopefully by the end of this project

320
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,820
for example if someone uses the phrase

321
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,700
guest Wi-Fi they'll get a slack bot

322
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,190
linking them to the wiki page with the

323
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,600
guest Wi-Fi information on it so then

324
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,280
they're not just getting the password

325
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,520
there they also have all the information

326
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,470
about how we do and don't use Gus Wi-Fi

327
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,270
right at their fingertips and I didn't

328
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,650
have to do anything that sounds amazing

329
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:15,010
I'm really trying to make myself

330
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:16,390
irrelevant as quickly as I can we can

331
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,939
also use slack bots for policy

332
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,650
enforcement for example someone post

333
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,990
something that looks like a secret API

334
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,640
key they probably want to know that they

335
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,760
made a mistake the slack bot can be like

336
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:31,060
do you maybe want to delete this really

337
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,420
helpful so I think that slack monitoring

338
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,979
example really highlights we want to be

339
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,420
visible and we want to be communicating

340
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,100
with the rest of the organization that

341
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,010
doesn't mean we need to be in your face

342
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,950
and disruptive it just means that we

343
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:47,980
want to be working alongside other teams

344
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,750
consistently instead of you know just

345
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,780
getting pulled in when there's a fire

346
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:57,100
which I'm sure you all know tends to

347
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:58,810
happen pretty frequently of course we're

348
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,250
trying to get that bonus money so we

349
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,589
have to make sure these efforts are

350
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,230
planned out and measured so we can

351
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,490
really demonstrate success and again I'm

352
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,640
not gonna talk to you all these poets

353
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,860
but we don't have time for that so I'm

354
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:16,420
just gonna I'll pick one example I'll do

355
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:19,990
you let's do the slack the public slack

356
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,550
channel so I wanted to find what success

357
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,860
looks like before I try this what do I

358
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,390
want to get out of this group I want to

359
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,430
start with a pilot group maybe you want

360
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,920
to start with a few people that are

361
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,880
invited to a public security Channel

362
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,060
before you roll it out to the whole

363
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,390
company what worked and what didn't get

364
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,550
feedback I love a good survey

365
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:42,270
I just asked people how they felt about

366
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:44,310
it and of course did we accomplish our

367
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,740
goals if you didn't just go back to plan

368
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:51,689
and do it again until you've got that

369
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:53,640
sweet bonus cash it's easy also I mean

370
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,590
obviously this is a helpful process for

371
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,900
anything not just communication like

372
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:01,290
this is project management right but

373
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,300
that's kind of the point we should be

374
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:07,380
approaching communication like anything

375
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:11,010
else like rolling out new fishing drills

376
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:13,500
or implementing changes to our

377
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:16,080
vulnerability management program this is

378
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,330
something that the more time and efforts

379
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,670
we put into it and the more structure we

380
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:24,870
put around it the more we're going to

381
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:26,990
get out of it oh and by the way doing

382
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:31,740
all this stuff will be easier if you

383
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:33,390
hire communicators okay so you may have

384
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,320
noticed that our brains are starting to

385
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,430
do things now because we you know I mean

386
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,930
that was pretty straightforward right

387
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,750
all this stuff that we can do in our job

388
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:45,359
it's easy peasy you get the money you go

389
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,270
home it's great but now we are talking

390
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,460
about using communication to address one

391
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:56,420
of the most talked-about issues in our

392
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:58,920
industry mmm ye olde talent gasps

393
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:03,500
InfoSec thought leaders loved talking

394
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:06,449
about the talent gaps it's a good one I

395
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:11,459
personally as a self-appointed thought

396
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:14,250
leader believe that we have a talent gap

397
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,470
in part because we have a narrow

398
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,390
understanding of what a security

399
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,310
professional is and that you know I'm

400
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,959
saying we pretty loosey-goosey because

401
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,629
I've met a whole bunch of you over the

402
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:27,900
last week and a lot if you don't but let

403
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:30,510
me explain so let's look at this very

404
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,730
scientific graph on our y-axis we have

405
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,100
tech skills on our x-axis we have

406
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,800
communication skills I'm gonna put a

407
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,689
potato down here just for reference it's

408
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,159
not technical it's not a very strong

409
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,220
communicator it's just a straight-up

410
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,050
potato this is Robert Frost I don't

411
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,510
really know anything about his technical

412
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,120
skills this was a guess I just literally

413
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:55,220
googled dead poet

414
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:58,429
man he died in 1963 so he probably

415
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:03,080
wasn't like reverse-engineering malware

416
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:05,980
in his spare time and then oh how did

417
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:09,260
thank you someone must I've been hacked

418
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,720
but let's get serious I have a teammate

419
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,879
I have rapid7 named Justin Pagano who is

420
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,770
a super technical dude and he's a great

421
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,510
communicator and since I'm saying so

422
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,180
many nice things about him I'm gonna use

423
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:22,340
a really unflattering photo of him this

424
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:26,510
is him after some sort of freak email

425
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:28,669
surgery but you know it would be great

426
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:33,170
if we could all be in that top corner

427
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:35,210
with Justin and his weird mouth but I

428
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,550
wish I had done a bigger version of it

429
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:40,100
still it's so terrifying like also this

430
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:44,440
even though under his eyes situation it

431
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:48,230
looks his eyes look very dead okay so

432
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:51,440
but it is okay that we are not all in

433
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:54,620
that corner that's why we work on teams

434
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,630
there are also plenty of security

435
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,360
engineers who are amazing at their job

436
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,390
and just not super strong communicators

437
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,240
and maybe they have no interest in

438
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:09,650
becoming communication masters and that

439
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:13,480
is totally fine but I think that they

440
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:16,250
know it's fine and I think this group is

441
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,370
largely aware of the opportunities that

442
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:22,040
exist for them in the security industry

443
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,678
and you know they're getting hit up by

444
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,020
recruiters and it's just well known that

445
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,990
there's a lot of meaningful work that

446
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:33,679
they can do without having communication

447
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:36,559
be 75 percent of their job what doesn't

448
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,809
make sense to me is when we use these

449
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,809
engineers who are few and far between

450
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:45,200
and we really need to maximize their

451
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:47,660
talent to implement things like security

452
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,900
awareness training but you know who

453
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,570
might be good at something like that oh

454
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:56,270
it's your girl yes

455
00:19:53,570 --> 00:20:00,230
this is about putting the right people

456
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:02,600
in the right job I am never gonna be as

457
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,710
technically gifted as a lot of the

458
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,590
security engineer

459
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:09,620
that I work with and do not diagnose me

460
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,540
with impostor syndrome I am just I am

461
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:15,110
calling it like it is and I'm totally

462
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,670
okay with that because and also I mean

463
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,159
don't get me wrong like I'm trying to

464
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,960
get up there I'm clawing my way up there

465
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,320
a little bit everyday but I'm really not

466
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,950
close yet but there are things that I am

467
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,760
good at I am good at understanding the

468
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:33,350
security controls in my organization and

469
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,600
articulating those to customers so that

470
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:38,090
they can feel confident when they hand

471
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,899
over their critical data to us I am good

472
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,800
at understanding third party risks the

473
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,250
risk that they're gonna bring into our

474
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,440
environment and working with business

475
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,540
owners in my company to make sure that

476
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,380
they understand how to engage with those

477
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:57,260
third parties in a secure way I am good

478
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,540
at anticipating where data leakage might

479
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,180
happen and getting in front of that I am

480
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:05,090
good at making sure our Bolen disclosure

481
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,860
program is working the way it's supposed

482
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:10,010
to and hopefully I will be a good

483
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:12,649
manager it is too soon to tell like

484
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,120
should I keep going I I didn't have I

485
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,870
convinced you guys I don't have impostor

486
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,899
syndrome yet I'm obsessed with myself so

487
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:25,219
the real point is I'm not running out of

488
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:30,250
work to do anytime soon so why aren't

489
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:33,620
there more people like me in InfoSec I

490
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,690
really think that they don't know these

491
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,310
opportunities are out there they don't

492
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,610
know that a lot of the things I just

493
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:42,200
described are part of this job basically

494
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,770
as soon as I knew the information

495
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,260
security existed I was obsessed with it

496
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:51,470
I loved how quickly the space was

497
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:54,050
changing I loved the idea of trying to

498
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,940
stay one step ahead of someone or

499
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,860
something that was out to get you I have

500
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,370
always loved the security community it

501
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:05,050
is such a unique and awesome and special

502
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:08,300
group of humans and despite all of this

503
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:10,810
when I met the person who is now my boss

504
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:13,370
at a security conference a few years ago

505
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:15,980
and he started talking about an open

506
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,419
role on his team I was almost adamant

507
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,670
that I could

508
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:22,820
make meaningful contributions in that

509
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:24,290
role I was super stressed about not

510
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,090
having the technical chops I thought I

511
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:29,450
was gonna be a huge burden to the team

512
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:32,419
of course I was not and there was plenty

513
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:35,120
of work for me to do but my idea of what

514
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,030
a security professional was was so

515
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,669
different from who I was that I just

516
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:43,310
couldn't see it so that's my personal

517
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,290
experience but I've got some stats to

518
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,060
back me up too

519
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,879
this chart shows the disconnect between

520
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:53,330
what members of the workforce think will

521
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,910
make them successful and what hiring

522
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:58,220
managers are actually looking for the

523
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,350
very top skill that is being prioritized

524
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,470
by hiring managers is communication

525
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:05,149
skills very closely followed by

526
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,970
analytical skills meanwhile the

527
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:10,040
workforce is prioritizing a slew of

528
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,540
technical skills which you know they're

529
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,750
not irrelevant they're important we need

530
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:17,840
them to do our jobs but there's there's

531
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:22,370
clearly a disconnect in in where their

532
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:25,159
focus needs to be and yet we are so

533
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:28,550
quick to devalue anything that is in a

534
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:32,720
stem degree do I want to be on a

535
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:37,730
security program of 15 recent grads with

536
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,920
sociology degrees like no but we do need

537
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,810
to recognize that the best teams are

538
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,080
diverse teams it's also not a diverse

539
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:46,610
team if you have 15 sociology majors and

540
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,830
and then once we have that diverse team

541
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,449
we put people in the roles where they

542
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,199
can be doing the things that they're

543
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,550
passionate about and really good at I

544
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,150
really think we can make a pretty big

545
00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:01,490
dent in this talent gap by expanding

546
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,440
where we are looking for talent and by

547
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,420
being mindful of how people with

548
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,210
different backgrounds can contribute to

549
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,490
our team of course getting people from

550
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:13,100
unconventional backgrounds in the talent

551
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,560
pipeline will also require educating

552
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,050
people outside of our industry about

553
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,810
what really goes into a comprehensive

554
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:25,220
security program beyond the hacker in

555
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:27,500
the hoodie and honestly I'm feeling kind

556
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,170
of uncomfortable talking about my weak

557
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,280
tech skills because I'm sure it makes me

558
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,530
less credible

559
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,930
as an information security professional

560
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:38,060
to someone in this room or someone

561
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:40,310
watching on YouTube which it's like if

562
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:44,480
you're on YouTube like fight me I don't

563
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:47,179
know you troll but don't fight me if

564
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,060
you're here in real life but I also know

565
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:52,130
that I really love my job and the

566
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,980
industry needs more people to do my job

567
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:58,190
so if I can help someone feel a little

568
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,740
less uncomfortable wandering into the

569
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,710
security world then that would be cool

570
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,990
so let's welcome communicators into our

571
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:13,040
industry and close that talent gap it's

572
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:18,050
closed we did such a weird slider anyone

573
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:19,399
to clap that it's like okay so but okay

574
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,980
guys like that was cool

575
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:26,120
everyone's brain seems really odd right

576
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,770
that was good um we did there were there

577
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,290
were three phases though we only got

578
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:33,740
into the middle one so we have to keep

579
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:37,270
going what could possibly be more brain

580
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:40,940
exploding than closing the talent gap

581
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:45,980
mind control you guys we're on it we're

582
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:48,320
doing this so clear tails is a she has

583
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:51,320
an awesome blog she has a background in

584
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,780
crisis communication and PR and she

585
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,480
looks at a whole slew of InfoSec

586
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:59,960
subjects to Brio a social sciences lens

587
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,980
and what I've really appreciated is her

588
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:06,880
ability to explain why we need to move

589
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:11,630
InfoSec communication into a more

590
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,820
positive and proactive framework I mean

591
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,280
you know it's one like people tell us to

592
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,510
be positive but like why show me some

593
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,530
stats Clare's

594
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:22,340
showing us some stats in a 1999 study

595
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:24,560
beachgoers were presented with

596
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,980
informational pamphlets and then they

597
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,750
were given a coupon for free sunscreen

598
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,150
those who read the pamphlets focused on

599
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:35,000
the benefits of wearing sunscreen were

600
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:38,750
more likely to use the coupon than those

601
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,010
who were given pamphlets about all the

602
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,530
horrible things that were gonna happen

603
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,970
if they didn't wear sunscreen so there's

604
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,350
a whole bunch of studies like this but

605
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,169
the real takeaway is

606
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:51,830
we know the consequences of ignoring

607
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:53,860
security hygiene can be really bad but

608
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:56,449
when we have the opportunity to do so

609
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,189
let's focus on the positives and make

610
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,290
sure that people feel good about

611
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:03,650
interacting with us and interacting with

612
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,178
these subjects we at rapid7 or building

613
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:08,179
some security awareness training right

614
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:10,549
now and it is really tempting to try to

615
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:11,690
just scare people with all of the things

616
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:14,600
that could happen if they aren't

617
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:17,660
diligent because we are projecting and

618
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,850
we are scared but there really is plenty

619
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:22,340
that people can gain by following

620
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:24,290
security best practices these are some

621
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,080
of Clara's ideas I'm sure you can think

622
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:29,710
of a bunch more and while we're on this

623
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:37,780
positivity kick let's talk about

624
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:40,820
eliminating blame language oh yeah okay

625
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:43,399
so I first came across this topic in a

626
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:47,480
blog post by Jacob Kaplan Moss from last

627
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,380
year also I totally realized that at

628
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,080
this point I'm just reading other

629
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:56,030
people's blogs to you but like they're

630
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:59,389
not here and I am so they're busy so

631
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:02,178
Jacob explored the blame ful culture and

632
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:05,630
info sack that focuses on individual

633
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:07,730
failures instead of systemic problems so

634
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,160
to give an example of what that looks

635
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:12,679
like let's say an employee clicks the

636
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,770
link he's not supposed to the blame

637
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:18,590
focus security team chalks that up to a

638
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:20,710
bad apple maybe they even get sassy with

639
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:24,020
the user and this creates two problems

640
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:26,450
one that user had a crappy experience

641
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:29,720
with us probably less likely to report

642
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:32,450
an incident again if it happens and two

643
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,210
maybe even more importantly we didn't

644
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:38,600
force ourselves to explore why the

645
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:40,490
incident really happened so we might

646
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,699
have missed an opportunity to fix a

647
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,860
systemic problem instead of looking for

648
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:49,910
a person to blame we probably need to

649
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:52,459
team up with this user and zoom out and

650
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:54,530
identify how this issue slipped through

651
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,450
the cracks in this example we could

652
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:58,570
consider if we're doing enough and user

653
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:02,350
training or if we need to change

654
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:05,110
email filters etc if the only available

655
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,689
vocabulary assumes that someone is good

656
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:10,449
and someone is bad when we're framing

657
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:12,970
the conversation like that we create

658
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,250
opposing sides instead we need to

659
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:18,389
approach every incident with this new

660
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:22,120
mindset something bad happened to us and

661
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:24,969
we need to figure out how to fix it

662
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:27,758
moving forward this is the same reason

663
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,169
we don't do we don't include names when

664
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,320
we're doing a root cause analysis of

665
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:38,049
course and you know what I'm really

666
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:45,539
trying to say is don't get blame get

667
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:45,539
solutions they loved it

668
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:50,620
ok we'll move along um thank you guys so

669
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,600
much for laughing at that cuz I was

670
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,629
gonna just I was going to do this until

671
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,309
it happened and it wasn't that long

672
00:29:54,629 --> 00:30:02,639
we're moving on though to another wild

673
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:05,289
strategy listening oh my god it's crazy

674
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:07,209
this one maybe isn't mind-blowing but

675
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:09,009
it's definitely as much a part of

676
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,110
effective communication as anything else

677
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:13,840
in this presentation and if we do it

678
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:16,209
well it can definitely impact our jobs

679
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,928
in our industry and definitely our whole

680
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:21,370
lives so we can start by holding up

681
00:30:19,929 --> 00:30:26,830
weird question marks and thinking really

682
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:30,340
hard about them is it so funny I'm good

683
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:33,879
all that like asking questions like who

684
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,949
are stock photo people um so we can

685
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:38,379
start by asking more questions and

686
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,960
really listening to the responses

687
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:44,199
instead of waiting for our turn to talk

688
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,929
something that I have a problem with but

689
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,360
I'm working on it obviously you know

690
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:51,129
this stuff at a high level but it really

691
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,139
never hurts to have a reminder I

692
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:55,870
definitely need a reminder every once in

693
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:57,370
a while it's especially great to hear it

694
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,559
at the beginning of a two-day conference

695
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,969
and it's great to hear right before the

696
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:02,500
holidays when we're gonna have to be

697
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:06,279
around our families for a whole bunch of

698
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:08,889
time so let's uh let's do an another

699
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:10,730
hypothetical situation someone is just

700
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:14,860
maybe it's someone in your family is

701
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:17,690
adamant about not needing to use MFA

702
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:21,469
this is definitely something that could

703
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:25,220
maybe trigger me but what I'm gonna try

704
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:28,520
next time is asking questions maybe they

705
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,260
will talk through it and they will lead

706
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,679
themselves to what you think is the

707
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:35,720
right solution or maybe you will learn

708
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,010
something about them and you'll see that

709
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,720
their risk profile is just different

710
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:40,250
than yours and that's the right answer

711
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,240
for them but they're wrong and they

712
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:47,240
should definitely use MFA people just

713
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,510
don't like to be told what to do and by

714
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,919
asking questions like well what's the

715
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,600
worst thing that could happen if someone

716
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,010
got into your email account what are

717
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,610
their accounts do you have tied to that

718
00:31:55,010 --> 00:32:01,129
who could they reach out to how long do

719
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:03,799
you think it takes to set up MFA that

720
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:06,169
last one was maybe sassy but you can

721
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:09,230
probably get someone to think that

722
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:12,200
setting it up was their idea more this

723
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:15,049
mind control stuff but we're not just

724
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:18,440
using listening as yet another tactic

725
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:20,990
for for Claire's mind control we have a

726
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,960
lot to gain ourselves from getting good

727
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:25,850
at listening you know while we're out

728
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,240
here networking let's not forget this

729
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:30,409
quote from Calvin Coolidge 30th

730
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,640
President of the United States I

731
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,130
literally don't even know if that's him

732
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,270
there were like I don't I mean maybe he

733
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,919
aged really weirdly but i

734
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,480
google-searched I mean it looked like 18

735
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:40,580
different men

736
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,910
but like I just liked the way that the

737
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:46,850
background looked and okay so whatever

738
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:48,520
it does a helpful quote it was cool he

739
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:51,530
probably didn't even say it

740
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,970
let's let's revisit the parable of the

741
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,370
Ox and how I'm doubting if this even

742
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,660
happened did this even happen is history

743
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,928
even real this is what I think happened

744
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,520
at a fair in 1906 were like people are

745
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:03,470
always miss attributing quotes you know

746
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:07,370
like at Marilyn Monroe said everything

747
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:10,340
like okay so at a fair in 1906 more than

748
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,979
800 people tried to accurately guess the

749
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,199
weight of an ox well no one guessed the

750
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:18,590
right weight the average of all the

751
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,620
guesses was within 0.8 percent of the

752
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:24,230
auxes actual weight that is insanely

753
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,959
accurate the more opinion

754
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,980
you get the more likely you are to come

755
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,030
to the right answer

756
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:34,520
listening is dope and we have so much to

757
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:37,010
learn from each other that is one of the

758
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:40,340
reasons that besides has been so

759
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:42,140
successful globally and speaking of

760
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,120
learning from each other before I wrap

761
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,770
this up I do need to say thank you to

762
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,600
people who took time out of their very

763
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,520
American holidays to get much-needed

764
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,770
feedback on this presentation yesterday

765
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,020
so thanks I know like in the grand

766
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:56,629
scheme of things like comparing besides

767
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,860
world domination to this like besides

768
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,419
this may be a better example of learning

769
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,129
from each other and this one's just me

770
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:06,470
procrastinating but I had to say thank

771
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:09,020
you but like okay like we're gonna do

772
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,159
this thing now I'm really excited to

773
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,379
learn from you guys over the next two

774
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,500
days and listen and if it seems like I'm

775
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:16,790
not listening just like remind me that's

776
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,310
like it seems like maybe I'm just

777
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:21,590
waiting just waiting to say something

778
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:24,529
just remind me that listening is really

779
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:26,710
dope do you guys like feel ready to

780
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,080
besides now
