00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:12,360
g'day my name's Peter Jack was here to

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,099
talk to you bout some pancakes today so

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,500
I'm a senior security consultant quantum

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,810
security I have a background of

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,899
illogical engineering my spare time I

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,729
like to break things most of it enjoyed

7
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:29,220
cats cars and crappy electronics so

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,450
about three or four months ago I was

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,278
surfing trade me as I do

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,950
trying to find a CNC machine to buy and

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,140
I came across a pancake maker and was

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,910
like I have to absolutely have this I

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,980
have no idea what I want to do with it

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,160
and sorry I just bought it immediately

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,269
and then figured that I bought a pancake

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,690
maker why not try and put on the

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,890
Internet

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,430
because that sounds like a really great

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,280
idea to do sorry I'm just gonna have a

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,280
chat about kind of what what the pink

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,750
egg butters how it used to work what

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,620
I've done to it how it works now and

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:04,589
what I still need to do to it

24
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:08,370
cool so the pancake bot was some dudes a

25
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,840
great idea - you're trying to automate

26
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,930
pancake making because that's a really

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,430
sweet thing to do he made it originally

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,940
out of like Lego and technics and stuff

29
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,250
for his kids a whole bunch people named

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,720
Cecil that was pretty cool so he went

31
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,290
and created the Kickstarter for it a

32
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,670
couple hundred thousand bucks later a

33
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,220
whole bunch of them were released onto

34
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,350
the market and I think now it's ended

35
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,729
version two or three yeah so essentially

36
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,520
what it is is just a two axis CNC

37
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:42,929
machine so it's like a 3d printer

38
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,869
without one of the excesses you feed it

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:50,250
G code just like a 3d printer and it

40
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,530
prints pancakes in any shape you want it

41
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,229
also comes with a bit of a software that

42
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,790
goes and you can design things as well

43
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,590
so it makes the g-code for you so you

44
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:04,860
don't have to go on right 2000 lines of

45
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:07,920
G code so I guess going back

46
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,110
what CNC so I'm commuting computer

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,870
numerical control is just a way to go

48
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,099
and control what's primarily been

49
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,010
industrial machines so it's been around

50
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,000
since about the 50s and it's the way

51
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,170
that um

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,170
old machinist and stuff used to be able

53
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,470
to go and try and automate things like

54
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,570
CNC lathes and milling machines and

55
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,280
stuff so rather than having to go and

56
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:31,170
repeat the same process over and over

57
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,570
again you can just go around to program

58
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,250
it design it once and then let it go and

59
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,480
then you don't have to sit there going

60
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,820
and measuring and checking to make sure

61
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,130
that everything looks the same

62
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,340
that's kind of come reasonably far

63
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,049
especially in the last 10-15 years where

64
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,490
it's come from being an industry thing

65
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,130
to being something that you have in your

66
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:54,830
own home like laser cutters 3d printers

67
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,959
kind of CNC Mills and stuff and now

68
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,900
within the price range of a average

69
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,540
person I guess a 3d printer you can now

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,870
pick up like 500 bucks and get a laser

71
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,489
cutter for a couple grand versus 10 15

72
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:15,120
years ago that might have been like 20

73
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:18,209
or 30 grand cool so I got this working

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,430
last night and in theory this should

75
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,680
work but the web server just wasn't

76
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:29,090
standing up a couple minutes ago so I

77
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,090
will attempt to do a demo

78
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,599
and that's not going at the moment so

79
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,940
I'll talk through it and then if it does

80
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,310
start working

81
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:50,569
so essentially you go and pick an image

82
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,130
and portal into its software we it goes

83
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,599
and Victor eise's it so rather than just

84
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,239
being like a rasterized image that's a

85
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,880
whole bunch of lines it tries to kind of

86
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,989
take point A to point B so that lets

87
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,579
each of these a set of coordinates that

88
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:05,630
you're printing rather than Ike an image

89
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:08,120
file that then changes into G codes so

90
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:12,200
it becomes a whole bunch of line paths

91
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,330
to go and follow and then the G code

92
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,478
looks something like that so for like

93
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:21,620
what's a pretty simple image as

94
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,969
seventeen hundred lines of code and yes

95
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,889
mostly just kind of Peaks y-coordinates

96
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:29,240
telling where to go G code so there's

97
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:30,470
just the instructions see it essentially

98
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,470
for CNC machines it's pretty

99
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,760
standardized among all the things it's

100
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,770
something that generally dudes and there

101
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:43,719
are fifties or sixties no and no one

102
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:46,789
else and so as part of doing this I am

103
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,740
wanted to figure out what the so that I

104
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:50,030
could reverse engineer this machine I

105
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,160
wanted to kind of know what codes it was

106
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:55,729
using and trigger they had only to use

107
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,729
it about ten different ones so um the

108
00:04:55,729 --> 00:05:00,680
kind of main ones are the G commands

109
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:04,010
we're at some by the G zero zero where

110
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,660
it's Nick's my place to go I can see the

111
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,599
speed so it can go anywhere from

112
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,910
hellishly slow to still not particularly

113
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,360
fast because it's just on um pretty

114
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:19,910
shaky bends rather than like eight or

115
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:22,460
one rigid axis this enforce commands you

116
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,800
can home the thing turn motors on and

117
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,789
off and then the pump on and off is

118
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,690
probably kind of one of the most

119
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:35,360
important things with this so it's a

120
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:39,100
receptacle of pancake mix and hopefully

121
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,660
it's not like cooking itself India and

122
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,850
inside there is just a pump with our two

123
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,440
valves and so that can either suck it up

124
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:51,740
and keep a vacuum or it can push it out

125
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,729
and create sweet sweet designs because I

126
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,900
can't get that webserver up at the

127
00:05:52,729 --> 00:06:02,599
moment this is just like an example of

128
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:04,429
it printing so it's reasonably quick for

129
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:07,520
like a simple design it might take maybe

130
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,110
three or four minutes for more

131
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,250
complicated things I've had something

132
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:16,220
running this morning for at 20 minutes

133
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:17,720
which gets a bit tiresome and in this

134
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,699
you can see that I did a really crappy

135
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,300
consistency pancake mix and therefore

136
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:24,740
it's like squiggly out if you do a

137
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,030
better job then it kind of actually

138
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,030
makes nice pretty designs

139
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:43,119
cool and then you get a pancake and it

140
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:44,649
is apparently delicious cool so I bought

141
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:46,509
this thing and then immediately I pulled

142
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:49,239
it apart because that's what you do when

143
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:51,039
you are an engineer and you get bored so

144
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:53,758
I pulled it apart and found out that a

145
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:58,389
head um so its main control board was a

146
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:01,779
nigger 24 25 60 micro on it which is the

147
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:03,219
same as what a I'd we know 25 60 heads

148
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:04,659
on it

149
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:07,479
I had a controller board with the SD

150
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:10,619
card and LCD support a pretty big chunky

151
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:13,568
power supply has just got cheap like

152
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:14,889
NEMA stiffer motors so exactly the same

153
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,769
thing as you'd find in like a normal 3d

154
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:20,259
printer it's got its ear vacuum pump a

155
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:23,019
couple micro valves so it's pretty basic

156
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:25,899
kind of components and doing a bit of a

157
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:27,519
google throw it figured out that

158
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:29,259
actually that lines up perfectly with

159
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,649
what kind of open source stuff is out

160
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:34,329
there and that all that done was kind of

161
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:37,509
essentially rapid design off kind of

162
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:42,309
open source 3d printer and throw a pump

163
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:43,389
in there instead they were very nicely

164
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:46,149
and they've gone and thrown the firmware

165
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:48,009
up online and what they've done there is

166
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:52,289
they've just gotten ripped the what's

167
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:54,129
called Marlin 3d printing firmware and

168
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:56,289
so that's a will open source and on

169
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:57,579
github it was really great that they

170
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:59,019
throw it up but they didn't comment

171
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:00,610
anything so you can actually tell what

172
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:03,819
they're done to the base image so you

173
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:07,329
just had to go and um I compared the two

174
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:09,159
files and try and do a death that also

175
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:11,319
based it on old version of Marlin that's

176
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:13,239
like quite a few years old now so as

177
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:15,999
part of what I did I throw it on the

178
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:17,489
latest version and kind of the biggest

179
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:19,749
issue that I found with it was that the

180
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:21,909
USB port on the side of it didn't work

181
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,719
which was really not that useful when

182
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:23,949
you're trying to go and connect it to

183
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,509
the Internet and you don't want to have

184
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:27,009
to be plugging in and out to eke out all

185
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:30,479
the time

186
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:34,719
so I flicked the message to the UM to

187
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,429
the founder of the company and asked him

188
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,449
if he had any idea why they had that

189
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:41,828
limitation in there and he had no idea

190
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:43,539
plugging it into a machine listening to

191
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:45,130
the serial port you could see that it

192
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,110
came up and then it just like killed it

193
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,650
about three or four seconds into the

194
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,210
connection

195
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,930
and that was kind of all I thought about

196
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,310
it at that point so the pros of it when

197
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,709
I bought it was that it was tidy and

198
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:02,329
small it was well supported it did stuff

199
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:04,370
easy and it worked but there's no fun so

200
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,890
I can only do a small volume of pancake

201
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,950
mixture that SD card thing really sucks

202
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:12,319
you have to be right beside the printer

203
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,370
to make anything from it it makes it

204
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,870
really hard to automate when you're

205
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,089
gonna like actually walk over to it and

206
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,980
put stuff in and wireless SD cards only

207
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:22,250
work the other way not putting stuff on

208
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,750
to it it's not nearly complicated enough

209
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:28,520
and you know it actually worked and

210
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:31,310
that's no fun so the current ish state

211
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,550
as of a couple days ago so I thought I

212
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,959
was really so I figured as part of this

213
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,109
I were gonna update the firmware I

214
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,600
thought I'd found the line of code that

215
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:46,220
was why it was limiting the USB port on

216
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,990
it so I went and changed that plugged it

217
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:53,390
into my PC jumped in the Arduino IDE and

218
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,410
went and tried to upload it to it it

219
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,260
looked like it was going really well

220
00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:00,380
until it bricked the controller and I

221
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,569
couldn't do anything and so then it

222
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,890
wouldn't even respond it wouldn't

223
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,140
respond to an SD card and I couldn't

224
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,240
plug it the USB and also your condition

225
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,250
seemed to die so that was really cool

226
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,310
and I was like I've got to go and talk

227
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,200
at bayside soon this is a bit so

228
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,910
I'll just go and try and re-engineer it

229
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,000
because it sounded like it was some

230
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,260
pretty open source stuff and then I

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,029
jumped on trade me and found a second

232
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:29,959
one to say well sorry I bought that just

233
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:31,490
in case I screwed up again so this was

234
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:35,109
kind of how I was playing on architect

235
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:37,670
to get my really fancy UML with diagram

236
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:40,790
so there's the on the right you got the

237
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,610
pancake maker what the original

238
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:46,550
controller was so the 2560 I just

239
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:49,459
replaced it with an Arduino 25 mega 2560

240
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,359
which is just really nice and cheap onto

241
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:51,800
the dice for something called a ramps

242
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,560
board and there's essentially just the

243
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,430
pen out on the top so that you can go

244
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,520
and drive your motors and control your

245
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,839
in stops and stuff there's a couple of

246
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,910
motor drivers in there as well

247
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,580
and that just went back to the original

248
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:10,370
motors that came with it there's been

249
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,860
controlled by Raspberry Pi running

250
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,330
something called Oh print and there's

251
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,000
just like a essentially I've just stood

252
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:18,200
that up as a web server that you can

253
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,960
connect done and that talks out the

254
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,090
serial through the Arduino and then

255
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,100
controls motors there's just a tiny

256
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:28,190
little um wireless access point in there

257
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:32,270
and just add make it a bit more fun I

258
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:36,530
threw in a couple Wi-Fi relays to go and

259
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:39,170
control the power for it so these are

260
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,260
just like I bought them previously for a

261
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,490
different project but there's like $5

262
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,610
Wi-Fi relay is super cheap from China

263
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,450
and you can just flash your own arm

264
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,380
firmware on there to make them kind of

265
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:56,690
play well with home kit and stuff and

266
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:57,800
now there's an API and all that jazz so

267
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,370
now all you've got to do is navigate to

268
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,740
a web UI upload some G code print the

269
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,940
pancake you get a message on the select

270
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:10,220
channel when the pancake prints and

271
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:13,460
profit so the rent support I was talking

272
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,670
about while it looks a little bit

273
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:20,380
complicated up there that's not too bad

274
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,380
in the middle there's like a Nick's my

275
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,070
section and so that just holds a motor

276
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,969
driver which are just little things

277
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,370
control the power of the motor that then

278
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:35,240
wires out to the two motors the top

279
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:37,310
right of the picture is the in stock

280
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,140
controls so that's just so that when it

281
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,790
goes and hits the end it knows to go and

282
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,720
stop and not just keep charging on with

283
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,579
the motor and giving them out

284
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,950
kind of top left is the control for the

285
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,890
pump so it's just a switch 12 volt

286
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:56,330
supply and in adjust the power and put

287
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:58,069
on the lift so I was saying before that

288
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,960
it was that the film was based on this

289
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:04,190
Marlin firmware and so it was created

290
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,710
for a bunch of 3d printers and it's just

291
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,680
a whole bunch of say card

292
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:12,680
it runs on ml microcontroller so it runs

293
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,719
on Arduino and it's kind of a

294
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,459
fully-featured J code see it and as I

295
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,899
said before there's only a she liked ng

296
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,270
commands that this thing uses so that's

297
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:22,399
more than enough it's a really big

298
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,470
community to it which is great in some

299
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,880
cases and terrible and others so the

300
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,899
forums for it are really useful when

301
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,939
you're trying to figure some things out

302
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,380
and in other ways they just point you in

303
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,709
the totally wrong direction because no

304
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,510
one knows what they're talking about so

305
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:37,310
there's only two real files to go and

306
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,620
that you're going to modify when you

307
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:42,800
pull this down and so there's a config

308
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,980
and a conflict advance file and these

309
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,349
are to just essentially a big long C

310
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,550
files a couple thousand lines each and

311
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:54,350
it's just a case of I figured out what

312
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:56,149
changes that made when they configured

313
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:00,140
their version and I tried to copy that

314
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:02,029
over to to my version of Marlin and then

315
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:07,250
also makes mixture changes we needed to

316
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:09,410
attempt to make it a bit better the

317
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:12,230
raspberry pi is just a stock standard

318
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:17,149
raspberry pi running an october i

319
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:18,770
roughly an image being a raspberry pi at

320
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,839
this hated room for expansion so there's

321
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:24,170
all the GPIO ports that you can use if

322
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,370
you want and it allows for things like

323
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,380
cameras to be plugged in so when I hit

324
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,660
this at home I had like a webcam above

325
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:35,900
it so that I can lie in bead and see my

326
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:37,010
pancake cooking octo print is so I was

327
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,689
thinking of like writing my own little

328
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,150
fronting for it and just being kind of

329
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,830
like a you drop the file in at prints

330
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,740
and then in five minutes you go and

331
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,420
wander through and check it out I mean

332
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,830
thinking back oh this is actually pretty

333
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,390
much a 3d printer so unless have done

334
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:55,070
this before as these guys head so um

335
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,510
octo prints like a essentially a

336
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,690
fully-featured like 3d printing

337
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,880
controller over the web it's quite

338
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:05,180
extendable there's heaps of plug-ins for

339
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,410
it you can do great things like seen

340
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,199
yourself messages to you select channel

341
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:12,170
or text you when it completes and you

342
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,300
can also like there's gonna be a weird

343
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,430
get stream and you can do time lapses of

344
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,370
your prints as well because that is

345
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,930
completely necessary while I was

346
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,959
prototyping it I also used this bit of

347
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,609
software called pronterface and it was

348
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,650
just a nice easy way just to go to a

349
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,740
plugin with the USB into the controller

350
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:33,140
and kind of be able to get and

351
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:40,270
stuff where I knew that I wasn't having

352
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:42,260
issues because of the the web side of it

353
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:44,649
these are the wireless relays that I was

354
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:48,050
talking about the real cheapest chips

355
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:51,830
the based on the ESP chip and there's

356
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,349
just a 4 pin 0 heater on it so you plug

357
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,580
that unplug it into your laptop and

358
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,839
flash some decent firmware on there I

359
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,899
haven't really actually done a whole lot

360
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:07,070
with them but that kind of India in 4th

361
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:11,800
through the expansion and playing cool

362
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:16,970
so just couple pictures of the build

363
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:18,560
that I did over a few weeks so top right

364
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,370
of the picture is um there's just little

365
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,930
Wi-Fi access point the Arduino with the

366
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,660
shield ons the kind of bottom right

367
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,939
there's the Raspberry Pi beside that the

368
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,430
unpowered supply and then there on the

369
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:34,760
far left and then um relays just above

370
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:39,920
those and actually look pretty decent

371
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:41,899
once you got it all together so kind of

372
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,930
my I guess my process of reverse

373
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:46,160
engineering it was figure out what kind

374
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,660
of controls they actually needed and

375
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:53,390
that was going to the g-code and finding

376
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:55,310
what what codes were used the internet

377
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,860
kind of relay those back to what IV

378
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,390
needed to go and do on the ramps board I

379
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,490
had to go and pull out all the wiring

380
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:06,740
looms and pin them out to figure out

381
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,910
what went we're and make sure I wasn't

382
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,370
trying to showed anything out which I

383
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,939
did quite a few times ripped out the old

384
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:17,688
controller flesh the modified um

385
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:19,850
firmware onto the Arduino I did it all

386
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,020
just on my desk first just to try and

387
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:24,889
eliminate some of the issues of the

388
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:28,329
glooming and get frustrated that you

389
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,329
everything keep breaking all the time

390
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,270
those kind of the cost of it so this

391
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,910
thing off the shelf was a couple hundred

392
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,470
bucks raspberry PI's are pretty cheap

393
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,330
and so there's kinda like the whole

394
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,550
thing you can give like under three

395
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,100
hundred bucks which is pretty sweet for

396
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,000
something there there's probably good

397
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,240
now gonna sit in the cupboard for the

398
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,240
next two years

399
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,870
but I got most the stuff from Aliexpress

400
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,190
just cuz it's cheap but it just takes

401
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,340
ages to come

402
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm building a laser cutter at the same

403
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,809
time so I had a lot of the components

404
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,760
already so that kind of cut out the fact

405
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:03,168
of him to wait for things trade me for

406
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,970
stuff that I wanted a bit quicker but

407
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,070
it's always a bit more expensive and

408
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,480
then I try and avoid at all costs go to

409
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:14,659
electronic shops because they are

410
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:16,730
expensive so some of the things they

411
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:21,110
still want to do with it is customize

412
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:22,760
the web UI that further do some custom G

413
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,830
code for like Spira graphs and like

414
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,809
fractals and stuff because anything

415
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:30,830
formulaic makes it really easy to create

416
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:32,030
you cope or throw on a temperature

417
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,620
sensor so that you can tell when the hot

418
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:37,039
plates up to temperature without having

419
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,629
to be right beside it do some pressure

420
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,230
sensors and controllers so one of the

421
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:45,830
hardest things to control on this is the

422
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:47,360
pressure for the better because if it's

423
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,230
too much then it kind of just splits out

424
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,820
everywhere and you kind of see do we

425
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,299
need designs and if it's not enough then

426
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,129
it doesn't come out of the doesn't come

427
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,889
out of bottle

428
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,150
I reckon having like a third axis on it

429
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,530
there's just like a big arm that just

430
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,880
like wax pancakes off the end when

431
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,080
they're done would be pretty sweet and

432
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,230
you could do that pretty easily by just

433
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,210
using the UM z-axis and then like a self

434
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,230
filling pancake better receptacle so you

435
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:14,360
don't actually have to fill it up again

436
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:15,710
just comes out of a bigger tank but yeah

437
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,149
this is probably the worst but I just

438
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,090
keep blowing stuff up throughout the

439
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,950
whole thing so like I bricked the

440
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:25,070
controller within the first couple days

441
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,570
of owning it I went through a whole

442
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,950
handful of motor drivers because I

443
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,950
forgot to put a fan in there

444
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,210
and it just kept overheating I didn't

445
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,179
know you could blow out SD cards but you

446
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,409
can we went through a couple ramps

447
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:38,000
Paul's been through a couple of arduino

448
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,830
x' and a lot of that was just kind of

449
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,330
shorting 240 volts over things that

450
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:46,070
shouldn't had 240 volts shorted over

451
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:47,658
them and a lot of kind of small issues

452
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,750
like that just by whenever you're

453
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:52,220
tinkering in things like that happen so

454
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,080
yeah it needs a cooling fan installed

455
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,830
pretty bad there's also lots of

456
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,520
variables with pancake bed is really

457
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,199
hard to get can

458
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:05,870
every time you make it but it is

459
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:08,150
possible there's also like the heat is

460
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:11,149
quite a big variable to how things turn

461
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:13,400
out pressure and time reverse

462
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:15,380
engineering stuff just kind of bias

463
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,280
nature sucks a bit and it always takes

464
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,320
longer than you'd expect help for open

465
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,850
source saw software in hardware is super

466
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,580
inconsistent so I found for some of

467
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,409
these components forums and stuff were

468
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,760
really useful and like people were more

469
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:31,250
than willing to help and you got really

470
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,830
good information back for some of it it

471
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:36,290
was complete garbage and people just

472
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,600
like don't wish to help at all or they

473
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:40,670
want to help and they just give you

474
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,260
rough chances the chinese components

475
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,060
pretty super and consistent so like the

476
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,800
motor drivers you can buy a pack of teen

477
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,210
and like three of them just don't work

478
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,590
which makes it really hard to

479
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,900
problem-solve why something isn't

480
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,760
working and i've really don't like

481
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:59,480
pancakes the messes it's eaten every

482
00:20:52,760 --> 00:21:01,090
single pancake off it so like are there

483
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,520
any useful applications for this

484
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,480
probably not so much but um i reckon you

485
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,910
could put some other stuff in there like

486
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,000
chalk blurred or and make like cool

487
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:14,300
chocolate designs or wax and make candle

488
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,890
designs or something I was searching

489
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,360
geek zone I was searching the internet

490
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,190
just for ideas of what people wanted to

491
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,510
do with them with a pancake maker and

492
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,700
some guy wants to make like heat gaskets

493
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:26,690
with it which sounded pretty stupid but

494
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,370
um I'm sure you could there's a dude on

495
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,180
YouTube who Weiner made like a laser-cut

496
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:34,939
Vin Diesel word of like ham and cheese

497
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:36,470
so that's kind of in the process of

498
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,700
doing a pancake Vin Diesel but I just

499
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,030
didn't have the time to actually finish

500
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,710
it and probably the useful one it's just

501
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:47,270
a really like easy way to actually teach

502
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:48,500
kids about CNC and electronics hopefully

503
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,440
I'll be able to give it to my nieces and

504
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,090
they can play around with it yeah it's

505
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,620
just a it's a bit more of a practical

506
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,879
way to learn than just like playing with

507
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,139
a 3d printer that you make a little

508
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,500
widget worth and then you throw it under

509
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:03,950
your bed and you never use it again

510
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:06,380
I found the open-source of the guy who

511
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,780
made the Vin Diesel bust went through

512
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,550
them online so yeah there's a bit of

513
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,290
Safa called slicer and essentially you

514
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,840
just tell it how thick your

515
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:18,050
is it gonna be so in this case like that

516
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,840
much and then it just divides it up

517
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:23,419
spreads it out over a few pages and then

518
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:28,129
I can just feed that into the pancake

519
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:33,880
printer software I'm just gonna test

520
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:33,880
again to see if that web service come up

521
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,540
that decided to race it itself which is

522
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,540
cool

523
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:13,509
cool sorry I'm just going to exit out of

524
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,509
this and

525
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,709
that's not going to help

526
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:30,479
cool

527
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:42,810
so in theory if I go and push that and

528
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,810
there it might connect

529
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,030
fingers crossed

530
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,520
Dumpty do

531
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:31,100
awesome if you can throw the slide or

532
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:34,190
the laptop back up so I can actually do

533
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:39,769
a run-through which is cool so this is

534
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:45,500
just a bit of software you can just

535
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:48,279
import a image into it and then it just

536
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,279
traces it

537
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,970
cool so you can either like doodle on

538
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:02,670
here or you can import images

539
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,660
it's conversions a bit rough but if you

540
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:07,200
play around with it long enough you can

541
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:09,860
make it work even if you export that for

542
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,860
printing

543
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,959
cool

544
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:24,260
so this is just creating that g-code out

545
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,840
of those images so it's just trying to

546
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:32,180
essentially Victor eyes the image on the

547
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:44,120
previous page that might turn out okay

548
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:48,760
now if I go export file now I can just

549
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,760
drag and drop that into the that web GUI

550
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:55,390
and if all things are going well

551
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:30,928
yeah oh that's awesome

552
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:33,639
I was convinced this wasn't gonna work

553
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:34,749
cool so currently the like the pressures

554
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:37,449
just controlled but like a little knob

555
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:39,429
on there I need to kind of automate that

556
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:42,119
in some way but um I just haven't quite

557
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:42,119
figured it out yet

558
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:50,369
cool so while that goes I can skip

559
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:50,369
through a whole bunch of slides again

560
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,149
cool so I figured like saying as I do

561
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,590
contesting during the day I should

562
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,330
probably actually have some idea of like

563
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:17,970
what the security of the octa-pie

564
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:19,530
software was like so I did I just had a

565
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,630
look at it the other night so there's a

566
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:24,000
few hundred leads online so not not a

567
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:25,350
whole lot but that is still a few

568
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,720
hundred people's houses that can kind of

569
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:31,709
go on fire so and just looking through

570
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,970
that showdown unless there's a whole

571
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:39,590
bunch that just didn't have that were

572
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,590
just available by just browsing to them

573
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,840
but yeah like so it doesn't really

574
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:49,470
matter that people were throwing these

575
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:53,939
up online like 3d printers do kind of

576
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:56,910
catch catch on fire so maybe you should

577
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,830
be a little worried about it so I had a

578
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,150
look at it and there's a few bits of a

579
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:03,030
few things I could do with the octa-pie

580
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:04,950
software I could just do things like

581
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:07,230
download other whose g-code files from

582
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,280
what I found I could watch them print

583
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,770
things because they were streaming their

584
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,410
webcams online on their printers was

585
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,389
just a bit odd really I could restart

586
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,750
their 3d printers and possibly burn them

587
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:20,100
down there were a bunch of like

588
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,050
vulnerabilities in the software though

589
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,730
there's like arbitrary code execution

590
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:27,060
there's a bunch of stored cross-site

591
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:29,250
there's previous I had a look at the

592
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,540
issue tracker on they get hub because

593
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,730
they have no other way of disclosing

594
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,930
anything and anytime anyone mentions a

595
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,750
security problem they just start

596
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:38,070
shouting at them so um I don't think I'm

597
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,840
gonna get much luckier actually telling

598
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,189
them about and get anything fixed so in

599
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,179
the meantime it's just not going to go

600
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:48,480
online but yeah there's got really fun

601
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:50,100
functions like you can restart your

602
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,660
printer but rather than just having a

603
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,419
button that says restart you can

604
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:57,390
actually just true what code it runs and

605
00:28:54,420 --> 00:29:00,290
there's just out of the box so yeah it's

606
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,290
got full route on the box

607
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,840
so yeah up until late last night I still

608
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,760
hadn't got this working properly again

609
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,610
so I used to work and then I broke it a

610
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:15,090
few times and I was trying to get it

611
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:16,740
going and this morning I was trying to

612
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,540
figure out how to get it going again

613
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,440
and I've been yelling defend him last

614
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,418
night

615
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,340
on the boat about how like the firmware

616
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,110
thing happened over USB and that seemed

617
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,789
to work but I just couldn't connect to

618
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,500
it over USB and maybe that was sharing

619
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:31,440
it with like the SD card or something

620
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,419
and so this morning I was like maybe I

621
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,100
should just go and like read the

622
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,450
firmware update procedure that I never

623
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,689
actually read the first time which is

624
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,100
why I bricked it and it's just like oh

625
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,940
if you hold the power button for a few

626
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,020
seconds then it all works so I kind of

627
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,760
realized this morning that I didn't

628
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,039
actually need to replace anything inside

629
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,840
it and then it worked out of the box if

630
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:56,700
you just hold your finger on the power

631
00:29:51,840 --> 00:30:00,110
button for three seconds so that was

632
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,700
yeah a good couple months of work wasted

633
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:04,289
but you know it's now much simple design

634
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:09,419
there's literally just a webserver with

635
00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:11,669
a 3d printer plugged into it yeah so I

636
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:13,500
built this up this morning like five or

637
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:15,630
six in the morning and now just all sits

638
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,200
inside that box was just a web server

639
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:23,130
those relays and a little bit of power

640
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,380
stuff to make it work so in theory well

641
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:28,049
know I can actually now lie in bed and

642
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,179
turn on the hot plate and the printer

643
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:35,210
independently the web server and the

644
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:37,230
Wi-Fi controllers stay on anyway and

645
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,940
yeah I can have delicious delicious

646
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:43,020
pancakes really for me without him to

647
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:45,059
even get out of bed so yeah one of the

648
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,280
reasons I'm wanting to do this was I've

649
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:49,980
been to building a laser cutter and I've

650
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,510
been doing a ramps conversion on that so

651
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,539
not all the works wasted and I can still

652
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:57,780
use all those parts and there but yeah

653
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:59,280
it's just a cheap Chinese laser because

654
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,440
I'm I don't like spending a lot of money

655
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:04,500
on stuff like this I've scored it on

656
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,539
trade me again and it was really broken

657
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,720
so someone had already blown up that

658
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:11,640
controller before I got to it and use

659
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,240
like a co2 laser you can burn through

660
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:17,549
like three or four mil material used to

661
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,049
print raster images which is pretty

662
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:22,158
rough and it just takes ages so now

663
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:22,158
it'll just be victus

664
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:32,270
I'll do that before Luke's and yeah so

665
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,260
that's pretty much working now and

666
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:36,050
that's what I'm going to get onto once

667
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:38,990
I've kind of this weekend's over getting

668
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:40,399
that going again but yeah this is the

669
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,990
suite software that that came with with

670
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,420
its original controller that's the

671
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:47,870
English version of the software it's a

672
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:51,890
bit rough but yeah there's kind of its

673
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:52,909
state at the moment yeah so thank you

674
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,000
for listening to me ramble about

675
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:58,840
pancakes for a while

676
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,650
follow me on Twitter or I've thrown the

677
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,949
after on the firmware that I've done

678
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:05,860
just up on github it's not very current

679
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:11,000
at the moment but I'll sort that out and

680
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:13,689
yeah and reflect back to this it may or

681
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,690
may not look any good

682
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,399
[Applause]

683
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,800
