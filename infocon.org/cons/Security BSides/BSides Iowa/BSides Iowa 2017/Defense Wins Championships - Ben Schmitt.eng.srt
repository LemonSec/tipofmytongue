18

defense today we hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot about</font>

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,449
offense a ton about how many shells that

<font color="#E5E5E5">i pop and what came out of the</font>

infiltrate con and that's great but i

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,200
think defense is maybe missed a little

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit so my goal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defense on</font>

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,100
really cool that's ultimately my goal

25
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">will stick it to pen testers a little</font>

26
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,669
bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll walk through different</font>

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,750
strategies on how to do that so whom I

28
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,210
Greg just<font color="#E5E5E5"> did a pretty good job</font>

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,890
introducing I'm Ben and I play defense I

30
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,658
have the privilege of leading<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec at</font>

31
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,860
the wall here in Des Moines been there

32
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,000
about two and a half years and it's been

33
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,829
awesome so again I'll go through what I

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,360
want to call it like a playbook this is

35
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,158
not all the plays and a defensive

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,799
arsenal these are just plays I think

37
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,270
show new design patterns different

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,880
techniques we can use against

39
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,350
adversaries or for that matter stop

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,469
giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> little hanging fruit to pen</font>

41
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,210
testers we can stop some of that stuff

42
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:55,949
so my buddy Nate's uber is not here but

43
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,600
he usually talks about offense and kind

44
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,159
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sticks it to me so I'm going to stick</font>

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,630
it to Nate in a very nice way today

46
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,520
about here's some cool defensive things

47
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,199
because you can do defense and still

48
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,859
kind of be a badass it's still possible

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,670
to do that so let's kind of start with a

50
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:13,170
story here actually before I start the

51
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,839
story a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not with</font>

52
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,850
defense I'm also a member<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sexy sm so</font>

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,290
the capture the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flag is led by sec</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DSM</font>

54
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,670
that's another group here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Des Moines</font>

55
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,739
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> meets monthly so if you have any</font>

56
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,540
interest in meeting monthly not just

57
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,750
once a year please<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop down go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sect</font>

60
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,859
talk to me about that site reliability

63
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that those roles he'll play defense</font>

64
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,830
and what we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,960
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a story here so my dad's a</font>

66
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,940
retired firefighter and you're like I've

67
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,590
been why is that important so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

68
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,530
a bit about the evolution of the fire

69
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,590
service from him so I learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> like back</font>

70
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,380
in the 70s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 80s they had metrics on</font>

71
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,940
well how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> fires did I put out right</font>

72
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,609
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of fires I put out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two cool</font>

73
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,380
metric and actually like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

74
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's the cool this metric because it's</font>

75
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,380
based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of fires not fast</font>

76
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,120
you got there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put them out and</font>

77
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,820
that's your effectiveness but shouldn't

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,980
you prevent fires so fire the fire

79
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,980
service has evolved into prevention and

80
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,260
survival inspections building codes that

81
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,380
reflect safe ways to make ingress and

82
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">egress education right I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our kids</font>

83
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,480
have almost stop drop and roll means and

84
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,980
if it still teach that careful design so

85
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,840
these are things that are important to

86
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,510
prevent fires and I think that's how we

87
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,040
play defense now it's not necessarily

88
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,840
great like how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> viruses I got this</font>

89
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,150
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a vanity metric but how many</font>

90
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,830
intrusions that I stop and prevent is a

91
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,470
good indicator so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

92
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,120
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fire service evolving how we</font>

93
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">evolve and that is actually from</font>

94
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,910
Manitowoc that is um that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pierce</font>

95
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,150
ladder truck they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> call it</font>

96
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:54,070
precious that's one of its nicknames so

97
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,269
it's an important fire truck but again

98
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:59,920
prevention is much more important so

99
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:02,799
info SEC has this fascination of playing

100
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,809
offense and just like every kid in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

101
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,190
high school football team in freshman

102
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">year I played football one year was too</font>

103
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,540
small but I did play one year then you

104
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,220
know didn't play anymore and the first

105
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,929
day of tryouts what does every kid want

106
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,790
to play running back running back

107
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,358
running back and so guess what position

108
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,849
I played defensive lineman because i'm a

109
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,469
slow dude and that's what fit but i

110
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned from that i play defense and</font>

111
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,970
defense really<font color="#E5E5E5"> matters so let's think</font>

112
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">about infosec here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i totally get you</font>

113
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,310
can't play defense not knowing offense

114
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:36,640
chen's on my team yes we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> run nmap</font>

115
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,110
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit and we can using that cat</font>

116
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,360
like we can do that stuff we understand

117
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,370
the basics but

118
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,039
we also don't walk around with

119
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,409
flamethrowers making things more secure

120
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,289
we want to play defense<font color="#CCCCCC"> imma leavin</font>

121
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:50,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">pentest your way to profitability but</font>

122
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,188
you can play really good defense and

123
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:55,259
demonstrate to your customers hey this

124
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:56,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">product</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has assurance versus I have the</font>

125
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:58,409
team of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the greatest pen testers on</font>

126
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,770
earth that's important but playing

127
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:03,629
defense i think is even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more important</font>

128
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:07,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so really busy slide but there's</font>

129
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:09,689
a lot to talk about so resumes come in

130
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,948
and I review those resumes and some

131
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:13,050
commits with little working experience

132
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:16,500
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and like all of them</font>

133
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,840
mentioned Kali Linux all right nice

134
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,330
that's in there I don't see anyone

135
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned threat modeling maybe it says</font>

136

mr. robot thing but as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> kelly</font>

139
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,969
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kali Linux that's wonderful what</font>

140
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,520
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it for now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for analysis and</font>

141
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:37,169
scanning and I'm like what cool so let's

142
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a theoretical here which may</font>

143
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:41,669
or may not help of cali but let's say i

144
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,349
give you a 2 gigabyte<font color="#E5E5E5"> text file just</font>

145
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,419
like straight<font color="#CCCCCC"> up syslog from the server</font>

146
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:50,520
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to go through then get</font>

147
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:52,169
information like how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPS attacked a</font>

148
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,639
trusted host like I going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

149
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:56,549
out of there you can't serve two gigs in

150
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,199
excels it's not going to happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'd</font>

151
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,080
use Kali Linux<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how would you use</font>

152
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,400
Kali Linux i use wireshark and like no

153
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,659
we're not dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peak apps here</font>

154
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,310
like we're dealing with straight-up

155
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:08,069
syslog how are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go through</font>

156
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd use wireshark and it's just</font>

158
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:13,439
put kali linux on your resume to look

159
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,360
from a vanity thing it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not cool unless</font>

160
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:18,210
you know what it means let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

161
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,379
how you can play defense so again

162
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,258
breaking things pivoting around

163
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,060
organization pillaging sis admins taking

164
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,979
their credentials<font color="#E5E5E5"> annex whole training</font>

165
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,509
data might be exciting but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

166
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,949
protecting the crown jewels is pretty

167
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:31,469
damn important that's we're going to

168
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,750
focus on today and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to put this</font>

169
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:36,659
info SEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> Maxim out there defense has to</font>

170
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,599
be right<font color="#CCCCCC"> every time and often just be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

171
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:43,199
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones okay so what does that mean</font>

172
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:45,029
it means the fire service correlation

173
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,789
matters we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on prevention</font>

174
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:49,080
not successful exploitation so Wendy

175
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:50,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">neethu have never met her but she works</font>

176
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,620
at duo security had this tweet i really

177
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,000
liked wish we had more info SEC

178
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,709
firefighters rather than so many

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,520
standing around with lighters hoping

180
00:06:55,709 --> 00:07:00,810
helpfully pointing out flammables so

181
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,008
it's all coming together the football

182
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:07,589
teams there<font color="#E5E5E5"> firefighter themes there so</font>

183
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:09,389
what change is happening well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

184
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:11,669
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> renaissance here in playing</font>

185
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,620
defense so there's two conferences that

186
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:16,049
are really good examples one of the

187
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,279
O'Reilly security conference and that's

188
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,080
kind of their tagline they provide

189
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,849
advice but it's focused almost purely in

190
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,430
playing defense it's their second year

191
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:25,349
it's in New York and it's to make sure

192
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,300
defense<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conference where you can</font>

193
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:28,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and collaborate not have to talk</font>

194
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">about metasploit or these other</font>

195
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,669
wonderful tools not trying to dig in

196
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,830
those tools but talk about creative ways

197
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:36,810
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing defense there's another one</font>

198
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,060
that just happened a couple months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

199
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,029
in Austin Texas called art into science

200
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,430
again purely<font color="#E5E5E5"> defensive conference and</font>

201
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,169
not just like how to do firewall rules

202
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,539
and play<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense like really elegant</font>

203
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:49,789
design patterns<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these design</font>

204
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,440
patterns what are some examples

205
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:54,839
deception technology which is a fancy

206
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,789
term for honey pots and honey tokens and

207
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:59,370
putting bread crumbs around your network

208
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:00,690
to detect adversaries your adversaries

209
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,979
kind of thinking like an API they're

210
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,229
going to crawl around under your<font color="#CCCCCC"> gooey</font>

211
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:06,029
so you can plant things on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

212
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:08,159
like a fake network attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> storage</font>

215
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">really neat design</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> patterns lack is</font>

216
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:17,039
doing where they ship their logs

217
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,930
centrally and really good logs from

218
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,060
oddity or their own tool called go audit

219

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> kernel level really robust logs ship</font>

can respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really quickly I think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really elegant design platter</font>

233
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,500
pattern how to play really good defense

234
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,910
not dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with signatures and</font>

235
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,189

using your<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone as a multi as a</font>

acknowledged yes or no it was you if an

239
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,040
adversary has your credentials they

240
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,209
probably have access to

lacked and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll just say of course it</font>

243
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,240
they send some<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your phone and I sleep</font>

next<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mine you're probably going to</font>

acknowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and if you don't over a</font>

246
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:16,279
period of time you can escalate so

247
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,009
that's one example<font color="#E5E5E5"> immutable</font>

248
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:22,430
architecture anyone deal with this this

249
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:24,259
one's pretty neat kind of you're born in

250
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,089
the cloud but i think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concept</font>

251
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:30,949
makes sense when we deploy my company

252
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:33,410
servers or images we treat<font color="#E5E5E5"> them like</font>

253
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:35,149
cattle not like pets we knock those

254
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,910
things over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we spawn new ones we do</font>

255
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:40,220
not patch them yes we have a handful of

256
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,219
long-lived instances but when we deploy

257
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,199
a service and deploy servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

258
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,699
virtualized right and they have a root

259
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:49,040
of trust we sign them they come from a

260
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:50,540
good place we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> patch them there's a</font>

261
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,849
vulnerability we just knock those things

262
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:56,209
over bring up a new am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i or image from</font>

263
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,620
amazon and it's fully patched so that's

264
00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:00,410
how vulnerability management is changing

265
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,329
that's pretty neat instead of ssh<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

266
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:06,110
or connecting via rdp you're running

267
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:07,550
wsus or SCCM or whatever you have your

268
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,560
enterprise patching button that like

269
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,120
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> will automatically patch</font>

270
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,849
when they come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a pretty</font>

271
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,310
neat way so to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security and so two</font>

272
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,690
tweets I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wendy's in before so I</font>

haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> here twice because I really</font>

liked it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> haroon mere is from a</font>

company called think stand they build a

segmented network and it goes off you've

283
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,300
got a pen tester on your hands if you

284
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,010
catch them that goes in your report

285
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,359
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good there's not a pen</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">tester you're a bigger problem then you</font>

287
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,199
got to squash that issue you turn that

288
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:52,279

00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:56,319
tweet that slack is really interesting

291
00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:00,170
what they do with their linux auditing

00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:02,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so my wife and I were driving</font>

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,979
back from st. Louis<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she was taking</font>

294
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,319
notes I'm like all right I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

295
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,959
throw a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different offensive</font>

296
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:10,459
tactics out in the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> so she's like</font>

297
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,869
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes and then we're going to</font>

298
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:13,040
talk about defense and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

299
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,689
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're not going to go through</font>

300
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,150
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and this is not an exhaustive</font>

301
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:18,380
list right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a list of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ones</font>

302
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,020
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> were interesting for the talk</font>

303
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,840
so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead and see how</font>

304
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,860
can defense keep points off the board

305
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,170
maybe even trying to fumble into an

306
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,370
opportunity because defense matters and

307
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,660
it wins championships so we're gonna

308
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,640
glorified defenders out<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and go</font>

309
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,459
through a playbook there's a link at the

310
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,410
bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> mitre has a wonderful and much</font>

00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,970
more in-depth listing of different

312
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,829

313
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,210
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a subset of</font>

314
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,380
these and I've been appendix if we have

315
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,420
time we'll go through the appendix but

316
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll probably not have the time but</font>

317
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe we will so let's go through some</font>

318
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,370
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and kind of go through a</font>

319
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,020
playbook how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make pen testers</font>

320
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,260
lives harder or make our adversaries

321
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:57,680
lives hard so first alone is man in the

00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle we've got Alice Bob and Eve if</font>

323
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,859
you ever done crypto you're gonna hear

324
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,660
those names a lot two parties have to

325
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,850
exchange information across potentially

326
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,810
an untrusted networks oh you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

327
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:10,790
some crypto so one of the variation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

328
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,250
this and this one's for real and I

329
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend you check out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that link to</font>

330
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:18,530
learn from problems that happen so in

331
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,930
this case there's a bank called n 26 in

332
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:23,180
Europe and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank has an API that is</font>

333
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,680
used for their mobile app someone now in

334
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,229
the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the API and it's very</font>

335
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,329
verbose<font color="#E5E5E5"> API which gives you a lot of</font>

336
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,480
information and the information was used

337
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:36,380
creatively to do things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could allow</font>

338
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,820
that application to be abused so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font>

339
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,530
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much about that but definitely</font>

340
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,720
check out that link from the Chaos

341
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:43,810
Computer Congress but<font color="#E5E5E5"> man in the middle</font>

342
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,710
is no no joke this stuff really happens

343
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,089
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can defense do a</font>

344
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">man-in-the-middle thing and yeah we can</font>

345
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:51,110
do VPNs and all kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff but let's</font>

346
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,610
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the edge of your network</font>

347
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">because everyone here probably website</font>

348
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,920
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web app maybe internal web apps</font>

349
00:12:54,710 --> 00:13:00,410
so the first thing is TLS<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 dot 3 is on</font>

350
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,910
its way it's basically here I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

351
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,430
about in a second you should make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

352
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">that edge is appropriately configured if</font>

353
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,870
you're doing older versions of TLS and

354
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,180
if you're doing ssl that's naughty you

355
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,070
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SS all right ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

356
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,719
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it ever again but</font>

357
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,610
one destry's on its way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it makes</font>

358
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,220
some really cool decisions for you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

359
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:21,020
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go down a TLS rabbit hole but one</font>

360
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,600
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> three does some cool stuff really</font>

361
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,730
fast session set up the handshakes been

362
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,620
reduced it's not two<font color="#CCCCCC"> round-trips it's</font>

363
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,330
one or zero because if you have existing

364
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,850
key material can be reused to

365
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">reestablish</font>

366
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,990
a connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trusted site in there</font>

367
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,220
using really good site for sweets you're

368
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,279
not going to use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the garbage</font>

369
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">like our c4 can't do it yours not going</font>

370
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,850
to able to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff they took it</font>

371
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,860
for you we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a syndicated</font>

373
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,250
later but there's only two right now

374
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:52,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">until s13 you can use against AES GCM an</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">NaCl sweet that's it both of those are</font>

378
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,160
authenticated encryption with associated

379
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,889
data ultimately means<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

380
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,500
confidentiality<font color="#E5E5E5"> and integrity so I won't</font>

381
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:10,589
go too deep here but if you're using AES

382
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,259
you've heard of CBC mode cipher block

383
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:15,089
chaining it's fine it's not not that

384
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:17,339
weak but it does not provide integrity

385
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,810
purely confidentiality so if you do a

386
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,269
forgery or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> it may not get</font>

387
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,829
detective you're messing with the blocks

388
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:25,319
whereas GCM<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oda stands for Galloway</font>

389
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:27,689
counter mode it has a mac in between

390
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:28,920
each block based on a counter that

391
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,050
allows you to provide confidentiality

392
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,469
and integrity that's pretty important we

393
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,449
were doing TLS one of the CTF exercises

394
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,779
for heartbleed and this is a mitigation

395
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:42,750
for that threat so T less 123 is there

396
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:46,019
when I say there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty hard to see</font>

397
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:48,240
but that's a screenshot from Wireshark

398
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:50,730
not for log analysis like those who are

they get a little harder for people to

00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:22,469
screw around and proxy another thing is

414
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,810
signing is totally something that we

415
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,220
should do more of SMB signing something

416
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,319
of use<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows you probably turned on</font>

417
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,389
but signing is providing assurance data

418
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:32,670
and by manipulated and so I take signing

419
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:35,459
really seriously Chen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do a lot of</font>

420
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,250
signing right Jen it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

421
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:41,790
to make sure stuff is not tampered with

422
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:42,819
all right password cracking so the goal

423
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,259
is not to store these

424
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:46,149
right you should have a trusted identity

425
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,769
provider and use that if you have store

426
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,949
passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to use a key</font>

428
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:56,169
derivation functions are slow and

429

about rainbow tables and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">things if you're doing some of these the</font>

here these are all not meant to be

faster performance for the right reason

443
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:30,729
so once called argon<font color="#CCCCCC"> two there's two</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">variants of argon too but this is a</font>

really new passer<font color="#E5E5E5"> based hashing solution</font>

446
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:38,618
and it's both memory and CPU hard so you

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,749
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just throw use an ASIC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Satya to</font>

throw ridiculous amounts of memory at it

449
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:46,629
too so it's really difficult way of

trying to brute force the resultant

around etc s crypts not super popular

00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:06,309
but it's been out for a while and it's

458
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:08,138
pretty pretty strong bcrypt is probably

459
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:09,849
the most popular one a lot of the

460
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:12,039
frameworks have this built-in it's based

461
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:14,378
on Blowfish underneath and it is pretty

462
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:16,269
expensive and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> PB KD of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

to that then this standard it's

sitting somewhere in the data store

474

476
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:44,169
on signing that we talked about crypto a

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,779
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of TLS talk about message</font>

478
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:48,850
forgery so your messages are pretty

479
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:50,230
important even some log stuff because

480
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,299
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> may have to go into an</font>

483
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:58,939
it's deals repudiation issues

484
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,650
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do here we can sign log file</font>

485
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,050
sign messages to prove they have

486
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,490
integrity because you want to make sure

487
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,909
if you have a message from a trusted

488
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:10,010
entity it's not been manipulated<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

489
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:12,260
up on the right now that's really hard

490
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,200
to see I apologize but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's something</font>

491
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chen and I were doing there is a suite</font>

nacl it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr. crypto but it is very</font>

00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,910
strong<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of academia and it's</font>

496
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:30,320
has pretty safe variations of crypto you

00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,030
can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are strong and performant</font>

498
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,070
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of make it difficult for</font>

499
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">you to screw it up based on their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> API or</font>

500
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,820
interface so this is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

501
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">we did in Python but we signed besides</font>

502
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Iowa printed the signing of verification</font>

503
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:44,330
keys out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> proved that it worked so</font>

504
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,340
that was a nice example of using signing

505
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,080
and this signing is done not<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

506
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,480
symmetric key it's a symmetric key so

507
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,220
you sign with one key and you verify

508
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,280
what the other so it's really nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

509
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,170
strong for distributed scenarios so what

510
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">can we do here so i talked about</font>

511
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,310
authenticating encryption associated

512
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,750
data or cryptographic signing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

513
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:06,230
there's also something called a key to

514
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:08,540
Mac so you've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of H Mac before so</font>

515
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,100
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you have web hooks and you</font>

516
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,600
want to omit messages to your clients

517
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,969
you're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going a sign that was</font>

518
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,830
using like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an H Mac and then a key so</font>

519
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,220
these are methods of signing things so

520
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,840
the message can't be forged a couple

521
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">things about crypto and again I've got</font>

522
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,889
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more slide and I'll stop in the</font>

523
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,240
crypt we can talk more<font color="#CCCCCC"> later RSA is</font>

524
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,160
getting a little long in the tooth I'm

525
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,990
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cryptographer but it's not my</font>

526
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,940
favorite elliptical curve seems to be

527
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,010
taking its place at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least for the near</font>

529
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:38,090
they talk about that too let's just say

530
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,980
ECC safe for now but don't be afraid of

531
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,149
non Ness standards I stick with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

532
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,340
missed but there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

533
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:46,900
earlier times<font color="#E5E5E5"> none the standard like ed</font>

534
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:50,060
25 519 makes sense that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of nacl</font>

535
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,460
we like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one and then an H Mac is a</font>

536
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:54,169
keyed Mac it's a pretty leading solution

537
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,820
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see that a lot and I'm</font>

538
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,950
warming up to see Mac Chen and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

539
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,960
testing that one quite a bit very fast

540
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,760
whenever something's really fast it

541
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,980
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> dangerous so we're checking</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">into that but message forgery is a big</font>

543
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,500
deal it's also not just messages right

544
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,240
you may get software if you pull soft

545
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,120
noun from a repository you probably know

546
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,070
check that it's signed not just pull it

547
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,070
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and trust that it's cool so sign</font>

all the things this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like to me I</font>

549
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's a trend we're going to see</font>

550
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,600
more and more signing to sell a true to

551
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:27,140
trust and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are are</font>

will<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop I promise that's Pluto I don't</font>

said draw a line from the Sun to Pluto

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,060
and that is the radius of a sphere and

560
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,879
then tell me how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> grains of rice you</font>

could fit inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sphere can you</font>

562
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,360
solve that problem with reasonable

00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,520
precision the answer is no it's an

564
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,830
intractable problem that's like super

565
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,780
hard I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even begin to know how</font>

571
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:11,330
because if<font color="#CCCCCC"> cryptos done properly we</font>

trust it it makes the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">breaking and intractable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so a</font>

574
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,510
couple tidbits on Krypto and then we'll

575
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,600
stop but I can go down a rabbit hole

576
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:23,810
more if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to later so TLS 12 and</font>

579
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,469
analyzing the edge and that's something

580
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,540
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is very doable and one de</font>

581

three is cool like please check it out

582

cloud plays blog a lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I</font>

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,100
encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about</font>

585
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,020
GCM is that since<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a counter mode it</font>

586
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,959
can be parallelized so can be really

587
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:48,020
fast crypto cbc cannot be parallelized

588
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,450
so that's kind of neat initialization

589
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:53,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">vectors matter that's randomness that's</font>

590
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,370
an input into a computation so if you

591
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,170
encrypt my last name with your Schmidt

592
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,209
you should get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of ciphertext</font>

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">encrypt it again you should get a</font>

repeat initialization vectors handle

596
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,650
that you need good randomness to create

597
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,500
those things so please use dev you

598

random for getting your randomness w

599
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,580
afraid elliptical curves you're using

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,110
hashes you guys all heard sha-1 has

them out use<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things don't put your</font>

608
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:31,009
keys in your code can you rotate your

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,989
keys do a forward secrecy base and key

610
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:34,159
exchange these are things you should ask

611
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:36,110
your vendor if they say they have

612
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,379
wonderful implementations of cryptic<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

613
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:41,418
this stuff how do you rotate your keys

614
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:44,119
better have an answer for that one and I

615
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:45,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">said before NIST standards are great any</font>

616
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:48,139
CL standards are great for the wind so

617
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:51,679
check those two out and I put a link to

618
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:53,809
one my favorite people that Socrates

619
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,489
Thom Kozik and that's a linked is just

620
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:57,049
he called a cryptographic right answer

621
00:22:55,489 --> 00:23:00,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">that gives really good guidance called</font>

622
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:01,850
the CliffsNotes of crypto so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll get</font>

623
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:04,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">off of my little crypto soapbox but it</font>

624
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:07,519
puts defenders in I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a driver's</font>

625
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:09,769
seat all right credentials stealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

626
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,600
so I've got my friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pentesting</font>

627
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:15,200
right and so Nate somehow gets

628
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">credentials I'll see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amor sniff</font>

629
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,619
whatever Nate's got credentials all

630
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:20,779
right great then you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some</font>

631
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:22,699
evil so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick it to Nate with</font>

632
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:25,489
some multi factor auth right we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all like</font>

633
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,809
multi-factor often so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use UV</font>

00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:30,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">keys I've got one on my laptop now you</font>

635
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:33,259
can use duo security so when my buddy

636
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,129
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> besides the Archangel box I want</font>

him<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that I wanted to be like damn</font>

638
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:39,889
I'm sure you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> past it creatively</font>

639
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,779
and i hope to monitor and catch<font color="#CCCCCC"> him but</font>

640
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:44,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want him to see that before he logs</font>

641
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:46,460
into windows box I want Nate to know

642
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:48,730
this pops up on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone and I can see</font>

643
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,109
that there was a login request I

00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,909
obscured while which hosts<font color="#CCCCCC"> its too but</font>

645
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:54,678
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually comes to my phone and I</font>

646
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:57,350
tap yes or no if it's no it's a security

647
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,820

is my phone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in my pocket at all</font>

649
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:04,100
times it could be I want to use you be

650
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,379
key to multi factor into lastpass so you

651
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,529
got to have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my laptop have my</font>

653
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:13,730
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to happen so</font>

654
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:15,559
multi factor is really important start

00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:18,350
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your highest risk users sis admins</font>

656
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,700
executives role that stuff out I don't

657
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,549
work for duo but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love their stuff</font>

658
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,739
really neat stuff and what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> neat</font>

659
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:26,899
about duo for two reasons or push

notifications one of the trusted channel

661
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:31,039
so that push notifications out of the

00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's me but they're probably not going</font>

to take your phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> man in the Middle's</font>

671
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,689
going to happen unless you're dealing

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,310
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> state actor here so really</font>

673
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,970
nice trusted channel now the other thing

674
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,350
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi factor D values a password so</font>

passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to be the gold</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Saint you</font>

676
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:01,429
get that you can get in if I use multi

00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:06,080
that password goes way down which is

<font color="#CCCCCC">really nice devaluing data is a key</font>

defensive tactic our persistence so an

683
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,169
probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that work again</font>

684
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,120
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be quiet and silent don't</font>

685
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:21,730
have some persistence and get back to

686
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">where they worth it as an eruption so</font>

687
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,210
one defensive play is<font color="#CCCCCC"> will throw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

architecture something you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw</font>

690
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,870
at them so there's a metric and netflix

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,810
bring one up<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the silver or bring one</font>

703

up and you as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumer don't know</font>

704
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,620
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backend just happens so</font>

705
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,710
persistence in an environment that has a

00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:06,110
mutable architecture and that rolls the

laboratory thing but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's a neat</font>

712
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,840
tactic you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the basics</font>

713
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,340
to i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying immutable</font>

714
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,649
architectures the solution but it's a

715
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,169
nice additive layer right continuous

716
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,360
security monitoring etc and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

717
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:29,540
bonus<font color="#E5E5E5"> here immutable architecture</font>

718
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,399
shouldn't change right it's going to

719
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,879
connect back to a data store but you're

720
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,650
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to install GCC in an immutable</font>

721
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,900
architecture environment you're not

722
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,400
going to do that so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything you're</font>

in middle architecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes that's</font>

rogue either sysadmin screwing around or

725
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,940
you have an incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hands it could</font>

726
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,250
you can loosely say it turns your whole

727
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:52,420
architecture into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> honeypot so I think</font>

728
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:54,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a pretty neat defensive play ah</font>

729
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,900

00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,400
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> later about threat modeling if you</font>

732

733
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,030
a solution what you should do it at

734
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,949
design time so you've all heard it's

735
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:09,860
really difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bolt security on</font>

testing a reduced cost that's a nice

739
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,360
political statement what does it mean it

740
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,950
means you don't make bad design

741
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,810
decisions if you can prevent them early

742
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,990
like that's a really bad design decision

743
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:25,760
I don't know how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened I don't</font>

actually designing or authoring code

versus its own production so threat

you're like tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> more all right you</font>

have a solution a web app I don't know

are the boundaries physically and

782
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,390
logically for this thing what are the

783
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,340
entry and exit points basically like

00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:58,130
you have your narrow firewall rules

787
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:01,190
defined are you making sure

788
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:03,740
ipv6 is blocked as well as before stuff

789

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the key</font>

790
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,660
technologies if it's written in really

791
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:10,909
old PHP like that's probably not okay

792
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,040
PHP be perfectly secured look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

793
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:15,080
they do it so let's Facebook for that

794
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,540
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> but your technology choices</font>

795
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,050
matter and then who are the threat

796
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:22,010
agents what are you dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with here so</font>

797
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,720
that's like a mental<font color="#CCCCCC"> model of</font>

798
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,150
decomposing an application you can make

799
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that model on paper where the data</font>

800
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:30,320
stores where the trust boundaries where

801
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:32,120
the external entities and then wherever

802
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,960
data crosses a trust bhandary like

803
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,659
that's where you should look at the

804
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,240
threats so then how can I do spoofing

805
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,860
how can I do tampering repudiation

806
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,380
information disclosure denial of service

807
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,270
and privilege escalation it's chris

808
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,850
collation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of privilege so it's a really</font>

809
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:48,950
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to live your application apply</font>

810
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,560
stride against it and should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done in</font>

811
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,660
teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then from that you can see how</font>

812
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,090
you mitigate or perhaps of them going to

813
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,770
get your design those different threats

814
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,480
so what's an example if I know that

815
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,980
messages can be tampered somewhere I

816
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,360
want to sign those you hear me say

817
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,950
cryptographic signing earlier that's a

818
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,219
good example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mitigation of threat</font>

819
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:10,040
model so there's a pretty example of a

820
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,120
threat model in a graphic but if you

821
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,470
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this pull me</font>

822
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,550
aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll walk through some with you</font>

823
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,490
and show you them a little bit more

824
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:19,129
graphically if you'd like buffer

825
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,780
overflows so adversaries may leverage

826
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:23,150
non memory safe languages overflow

827
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:26,600
buffer so we're talking like<font color="#E5E5E5"> C C++ kind</font>

828
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:28,040
of stuff here it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also happen without</font>

829
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,610
an adversary forcing the issue and I'll

830
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:33,200
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that in a second so you know</font>

831
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:34,790
there's another old computer saying and

832
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've talked about earlier it's got to be</font>

833
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:39,350
fast it's probably dangerous and C and

834
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,630
C++ is a good example of that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

835
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:43,459
not using memory safe allocations like

836
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:46,520
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> overflow buffer really easily</font>

837
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:48,410
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this just happened happened at</font>

838
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">CloudFlare a couple months ago where</font>

839
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:52,010
they had a legacy component that was

840
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:54,650
written<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C there was a buffer issue</font>

841
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:57,590
and they were exposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some of the</font>

842
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:59,060
responses to clients other areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

843
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,679
memory that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may have contained tokens</font>

844
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,330
and other stuff it's bad they did a

845
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,340
wonderful job cleaning up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> responding</font>

846
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:06,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">to it I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure their code audits and</font>

847
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,320
response make them extremely secure

848
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,120
right now

849
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,919
but this is a big deal like this stuff

850
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,030
still happens and buffer overflows I've

851

been here in the bottom since I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

852
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:16,200
my teens I think so what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

853
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,390
what's the defensive play here what's

protections if they're writing stuff in

860
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,350
non memory safe language is closer to

performance and is memory safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

874
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:05,430
cool reconnaissance so adversaries need

875
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,950
to learn about research identification

876
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:09,360
or selection of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your targets like they</font>

878
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,580
and do investigation well you should

879
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">have really robust monitoring and maybe</font>

880
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:20,370
even some deception techniques so a good

881
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,400
example is on the edge of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> platform if</font>

882
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:25,770
you're using some crappy<font color="#CCCCCC"> bots and it</font>

883
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,410

00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:29,250
would have in a normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chrome browser</font>

885
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,600
we're probably gonna look at the user

00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">agent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably look at your IP address</font>

887
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,469
we're probably not<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenged it in some</font>

888
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,630
interstitial pages and challenges doing

889
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,270
JavaScript puzzles if you don't solve

890
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:40,380
those quickly you're probably a bot and

891
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,840
then we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font>

892
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,790
with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like we can have really good</font>

893
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,439

information back so this honey pot honey

905
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:14,940
tokens I mentioned thanks to canary

906
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:16,290
there's another set of campaigns or

00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,660
tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> in symetra that's really</font>

908
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,399
interesting but you can put certain

909
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,110
elements in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment that</font>

no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> should ever connect to you can</font>

911
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,649
put them inside a word docs even and if

912
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,120
someone's opening these word docs are

913
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,590
looking at these tokens someone's doing

914
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,080
reconnaissance you should probably

915
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:33,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what's going on have adaptive</font>

segment you shouldn't touch that thing

919
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,560
it's a very high value alert I think we

920
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,570
all get low value alerts in our inbox

921
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's just noisy that's one of those</font>

922
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,300
alerts that should never go off and you

923
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">should have those alerts in your</font>

924
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:51,600
environment and if it goes off you got a

925
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:53,220
problem and I put a link this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is from</font>

saying here's how you keep us out of

00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,360
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment and one of the ways is</font>

929
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,690
not letting them learn about your

932
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:05,220
network better than you by the time we

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,780
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something well stop the</font>

play here anyone know what airplane that

reconnaissance we stole some credentials

942
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,320
you've elevated privilege and we're

get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out of the environment but</font>

956
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:57,210
what's a leading practice and so I

957
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,980
talked a little bit go at slacks doing

958
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,350
and I try to show different examples of

959
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,150
how you can combine certain things to do

960
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,730
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good defense against lateral</font>

961
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,470
movement i'm slackin eps here two of the

962
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,660
groups that do fantastic defense against

963
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:12,209
lateral movement so pick your low

964
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,830
correlation engine of choice those are

965
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,650
two examples I don't work for either

966
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:19,290
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to advocate either 11 just more</font>

967
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:22,260
expensive right so if i send<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of our</font>

968
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:24,330
logs two elastics back and you can do

969
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:27,240
this either in real-time using audit d

970
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,290
or you could use go audit which came

971
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,600
from slack you're going to stream the

972
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:33,420
log there in real time and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

973
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,430
it off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your environment into like a</font>

00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,559
your v pc or your own secure cloud which

975
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:40,169
is a nice leading practice and then from

976
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you get data from agents so go on</font>

going on file integrity monitoring what

984
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,890
kernel modules are loaded etc and then

I won't say anymore but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:28,530
that yes or no if they tap no its

1000
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:30,720
security event so let your powers

1001
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:35,089
combined to stop lateral movement that's

1002
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,770
a good defensive play<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright bot abuse</font>

1003
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:40,859
exercise for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience can everyone</font>

1004
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:43,549
see what is inside of the lower right

1005
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:46,109
hand corner<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in the courier font</font>

1006
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:49,609
what looks bad about that that user

1007
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:49,609
agent tell me what looks wrong with that

1008
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,980
anything with the versions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1009
00:36:55,150 --> 00:37:04,799
components that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in there look funny</font>

1010
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:07,569
to you it could be it could lie to me

1011
00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:09,609
this client could certainly lie but

1012
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:11,020
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something to throw the</font>

1013
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:13,150
defender off what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they doing with</font>

1014
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,970
the versions look at the version of

1015
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:17,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chrome 47 dot 0 dot 49 and then what's</font>

1016
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:21,339
happening after that why are their

1017
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:22,510
letters where integers should be you

1018
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,859
know they're being clowns they're

1019
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:26,829
randomizing the versions of throw off

1020
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:28,930
machine learning statistics so like this

1021
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:30,730
a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw this and I'm like clowns</font>

1022
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:34,930
that's not cool like why would you do

1023
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:36,190
that like everything else was static by

1024
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,990
the way except for the versions I'm like

1025
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:40,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">well you're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very good adversarial</font>

1026
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:41,288
like you can do better and so we're

1027
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:42,789
looking through the logs or like all

1028
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:46,809
right that's a regex solution to that

1029
00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:48,069
problem what we did but like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

1030
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:49,390
monitor what's happening to your edge

1031
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:52,210
because people are going to use

1032
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:54,069
adversary like that box to abuse forms

1033
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:56,140
could be log entry registration they may

1034
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:58,509
be want to steal<font color="#E5E5E5"> your content spider</font>

1035
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:01,029
your resources take it waste your

1036
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,369
bandwidth and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a problem but</font>

1037
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:05,079
you also can't be so aggressive with

1038
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:08,559
your box that you stop them from spider

1039
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:12,010
in your site<font color="#E5E5E5"> googlebot is nice bing bot</font>

1040

1041
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:17,619

1042
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:19,058
there you have to do a combination of

1043
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:21,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">things to make sure the bots stay away</font>

1044
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:23,470
so DDoS mitigation aside which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

1045
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,869
all be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing what do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you can</font>

1046
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,189
check the browser for integrity if

1047
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:28,779
they're a good bot they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1048
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:30,609
respond in a certain way if they're bad

1049
00:38:28,779 --> 00:38:33,460
but they're probably not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve</font>

1050
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:35,529
your challenges the IP reputation<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1051
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:38,319
looked at I'm kind of so-so on that

1052
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:39,520
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changed so much but you can</font>

1053
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:41,470
issue challenges and you should be

1054
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">careful about that but a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> captcha we've</font>

1055
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:46,419
all seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google captures right</font>

1056
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,950
recaptures awesome doesn't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for API</font>

1057
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,270
so else you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful with how</font>

1058
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:52,240
you're responding you should respond for

1059
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:54,460
JSON and API infrasonic the HTML HTML

1060
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,689
you should leave their<font color="#CCCCCC"> a parity but you</font>

1061
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be able to challenge your</font>

1062
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:01,319
browser's a full<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chrome browser</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1064
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:07,690
and that's a good thing so with the

1065
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:10,299
defensive play for BOTS the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> dee da</font>

1066
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,980
stuff should load balance you should

1067
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:13,599
make sure if you have up if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

1068
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,700
enough target<font color="#E5E5E5"> use some like Akamai or</font>

1069
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,589
cloud player but I'm more worried about

1070
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,910
abuse now the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS thing it's not</font>

1071
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:21,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally solved but I'm worried about</font>

1072
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:22,930
abuse so you should be able to find

1073
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BOTS and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if they're doing</font>

1074
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,808
silly stuff like Reggie Jackson if you

1075
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,399
don't have those logs that's a problem

1076
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:29,740
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have the log fuel to notice</font>

1077
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,329
that like that's interesting if the user

1078
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,959
agents are that<font color="#E5E5E5"> widely distributed</font>

1079
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:36,910
statistically there's something going on

1080
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright remote access if the adversary</font>

1081
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:41,828
is not an insider they need some kind of

1082
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,500
remote access so what do you do so we

1083
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:46,329
all have<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPNs here I'm assuming we do</font>

1084
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,400
multi-factor that stuff like at least a

1085
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:51,039
certificate that you trust as individual

1086
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,279
plus and credentials<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you can do do</font>

1087
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:57,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">all not push notifications you can also</font>

1088
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:58,990
do neat stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> geofencing so I live</font>

1089
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,940
in Ames I can meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to Des Moines</font>

1090
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:02,529
and I go back to ames I go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Des Moines</font>

1091
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">I go to ames and I do that all the time</font>

1092
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:07,480
so by doing that I have a pretty

1093
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,190
predictable pattern where my IP

1094
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,109
addresses where I source my connections

1095
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,059
are going to be from and yeah I travel

1096
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:15,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">and do other stuff but I'm a pretty</font>

1097
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:17,020
predictable pattern so you could look at

1098
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,299
those log and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright Ben Schmidt</font>

1099
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:24,700
probably is not going to be pnn from

1100
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:26,579
from Denmark 30 minutes after VPN dinner

1101
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,859
in Des Moines like that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font>

1102
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:32,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">right that's a problem so you can apply</font>

1103
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:34,808
geofencing use math to do that don't

1104
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:36,730
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it but you can apply geofencing</font>

1105
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:38,079
look at patterns of connectivity make

1106
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,329
sure it matches what you'd expect things

1107
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,730
that are plausible and if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1108
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:44,380
plausible and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll push notification</font>

1109
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:49,750
what's going on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

1110
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:51,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay vulnerability discovery</font>

1111
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,470
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool so if an adversary can</font>

1112
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,598
detect your weaknesses they can exploit

1113
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:57,339
them for fun and profit so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> remover</font>

1114
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,010
mitigate them and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of code</font>

1115
00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:01,960
probably has vulnerabilities in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1116
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:03,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so what do you do so there's</font>

1117
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,730
common stuff limit your attack surface

1118
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,270
and scan yourself continuously scan your

1119
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:12,130
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric Johnson is talking here today</font>

1120
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:13,980
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good talk about</font>

1121
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,619
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> security as far</font>

1122
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,540
the development<font color="#E5E5E5"> pipeline as you can not</font>

1123
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:20,910
scan once it's in production skin and

1124
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:23,279
thus far too like the build it's not

1125
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,359
down to the IDE as you can remove the

1126
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,840
low-hanging<font color="#E5E5E5"> throat don't leave those</font>

1127
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:29,430
stuff out there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can also do more</font>

1128
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,230
stuff a private bug bounty programs a

1129
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:32,970
good example because you want to

1130
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,200
responsibly to disclose vulnerabilities

1131
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:36,540
and deal with those and reward the

1132
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,859
researcher that's all cool but I think

1133
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,890
one thing that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> neat leading</font>

1134
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:43,080
practice is some that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fc's been doing</font>

1135
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,279
they log everything if it moves they log

1136
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,720
it and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can log it they measure</font>

1137
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:50,190
it great they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> even been publicly</font>

1138
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,709
talking a little bit about in the past

1139
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,350
they can see from their logging pen

1140
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,060
testers trying different things if they

1141
00:41:55,350 --> 00:42:00,029
see what the pen tester<font color="#E5E5E5"> adversary is</font>

1142
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:01,920
doing quickly they might know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

1143
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,350
exploit before the pen tester has

1144
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,850
exploited it and if that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case and</font>

1145
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,770
they can fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that bug before it's fully</font>

1146
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:10,080
exploited and get your bugs for free if

1147
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:12,869
you monitor cool well enough and that's

1148
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a really neat place to be so that's</font>

1149
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:18,720
like the zenith of playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

1150
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:21,690
defenses your edge supply<font color="#CCCCCC"> chain</font>

1151

00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:24,900
parties do you trust them he trusts a

add them<font color="#E5E5E5"> we only nearly eat a vendor</font>

management process does not to be super

1158

1159
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,859
trust your vendors how do you gain trust

1160
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,359
you need some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of process and it may</font>

not be give me your<font color="#E5E5E5"> sock to report it</font>

1162
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,480
might be show me some realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test</font>

1163
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:47,430
fill out<font color="#CCCCCC"> this form how do you gain that</font>

1164
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,350
your vendors are doing the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1165
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:51,390
and then based on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I put them in</font>

1166
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:53,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">a portfolio based on the data they</font>

00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:05,130
review so a good event say so the cloud

1171
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,420
player thing that would be an event

1172

where I'd want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some comfort like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so you had this bug you fixed it</font>

1174
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:12,540
quickly cleaned up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet in the</font>

1175
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:14,850
week it's commendable what have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you done</font>

1176
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,500
to make sure that you've managed that

1177
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:18,480
going forward and that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,740
document and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then have as a continuous</font>

1180
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:24,520
thing you do to evaluate your vendors

1181
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,200
and then you should make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure your</font>

1182
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,060
vendors don't have full time access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's work at a phone company and</font>

1186
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:37,030
vendors would have acted back when

1187
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:39,040
modems are on anyone working modems am i

1188
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:40,720
dating myself like we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have those</font>

1189
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,790
anymore right we're dialing is pretty

1190
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,919
probably still around I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't Ward Allen</font>

1191
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:47,859
still works but you don't give your

1192
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,930
vendors unfettered access give him a VPN

1193
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:52,150
but they should schedule when they need

1194
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:53,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use it or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a really secure way of</font>

1195
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:55,150
getting in your network to help you they

1196
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:58,319
shouldn't have unfettered access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1197
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:58,320
environment this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not cool anymore</font>

1198
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:03,609
that you guys have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard about</font>

1199
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,799
target right they responded well but not

1200
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:07,900
soon enough to a big problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

1201
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,760
came from a third-party portal that a

1202
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,640
vendor used an<font color="#CCCCCC"> HVAC vendor and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1203
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,030
the day pivoted and got in and did stuff

1204
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,618
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a big deal this is not</font>

1205
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:20,770
just normal compliance work<font color="#E5E5E5"> if stuff you</font>

1206
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:22,480
have to do so if defense fails how do

1207
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:23,740
you respond and I think there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1208
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,090
talked earlier about if there's a data

1209
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,368
breach what do you do I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

1210
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:30,070
given by you I missed that I was in the

1211
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:33,430
CTF I apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

1212
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:36,280
what do you do no network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is intrusion</font>

1213
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:37,810
proof that's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> defeatist to say</font>

1214
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,119
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the truth you need to</font>

1215
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:42,310
respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> quickly to a security event so</font>

1216
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:44,950
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> become a breach so what do</font>

1217
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:46,810
you do you adapt your defense defense is

1218
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:48,730
not static it has to change has to

1219
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:51,040
evolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like your adversaries</font>

1220
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,080
evolved and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the evil so</font>

1221
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,130
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely not speaking the legal</font>

1222
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,950
and speaking like what are the

1223
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:59,710
defensive-minded security team do to

1224
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:01,419
support the organization an illegal you

1225
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:03,730
to hunt isolate manage the threat

1226
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:05,470
according to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a process a critical of</font>

1227
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:07,839
security and send response process and

1228
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:09,700
you need some training or resources

1229
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,960
either you can call that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trusted and</font>

1230
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,419
have gone through your vendor risk

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,390
management process or people in house

1232
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help isolate the threat so if</font>

1233
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:19,810
you're doing the capture the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flag I'm</font>

00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,460
not trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give hints but volatility</font>

1235
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:23,320
might be a useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use in the</font>

1236
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,750
capture the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flag that's a framework to</font>

1237
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,220
go through memory if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1239
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,609
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write a lot to disk like that's</font>

00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:33,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">old-school they're going to put stuff in</font>

1241
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:35,560
memory and have a memory-based exploit

1242
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,800
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably need to image the memory</font>

1243
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">and go</font>

1244
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,550
through and find out what processes are

1245
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:41,200
running what processes are no longer

1246
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:44,140
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> but still are reflected in</font>

1247
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,180
memory what's happening on this host

1248
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,950
what's the last what are the kernel

1249
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,509
modules running you need that stuff from

1250
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:51,339
memory so you need to hunt that

1251
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:53,680
threatened deal with it and deal with it

1252
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,720
probably by doing really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good forensic</font>

1253
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,330
data acquisition following best evidence

1254
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,069
and chain of container custody but also

1255
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:01,900
being able to go into the memory going

1256
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:04,030
through disks and looking at your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac</font>

1257
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:07,180
times that's old<font color="#CCCCCC"> school you do a lot</font>

1258

more I don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have time for war</font>

1259
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:12,430
stories talk to me later actually i'll

1260
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:13,810
tell you one the lockouts is the most

1261
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:17,799
embarrassing<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece of code of our</font>

1262
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:20,170
written in my life at a different

1263
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,090
company not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I work at now I got</font>

1264
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">a cause really sick do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a call like</font>

1265
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:26,230
nine at night and get in here accounts

1266
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:28,780
are locking out that are important to

1267
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,310
production like all right so I get in

1268
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:33,040
there we're dealing with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> old-school</font>

1269
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:36,070
worm this is a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and we had</font>

1270
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,740
to keep production up and so I wrote a

1271
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:40,390
tool endless loop I didn't a vbscript<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1272
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:42,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">old it was that would automatically</font>

1273
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:43,750
detect the count lockouts unlock them

1274
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,730
and log it to a file so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could deal</font>

1275
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,710
with instant response and these vb

1276
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:49,870
script wasn't fast enough then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wrote</font>

1277
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:51,640
in powershell which is a lot faster to

1278
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:53,830
automatically unlock accounts that are

1279
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,480
being automatically locked log them to a

1280
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:58,270
file so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could keep production up but</font>

1281
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,100
do instant response if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i played like out</font>

1282
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:02,650
of the book defense<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright shut the</font>

1283
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,670
network down like that is an issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1284
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:06,220
looked at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> threat and so this is</font>

1285
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:08,410
automated from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inside let's mitigate</font>

1286
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:10,120
in a different way so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wrote anti</font>

1287
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:12,100
security software to keep production up

1288
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,240
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wrote a really good logging system</font>

1289
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,069
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> i knew exactly was happening</font>

1290
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:18,129
and use<font color="#E5E5E5"> those logs to isolate the threat</font>

1291
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:19,720
which is commodity malware we'll talk

1292
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:22,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">about proxy abuse and bots another time</font>

1293
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,109
so I'm kind of getting to my last slide

1294
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:24,520
here and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave a little time</font>

1295
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:27,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">for questions but defense wins</font>

1296
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,080
championships big fan of JJ<font color="#E5E5E5"> Watt he</font>

1297
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,940
makes a massive difference and I don't

1298
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,680
you ever notice but the dude catches

1299
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:35,470
passes and does some offense once in a

1300
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,509
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like defenders ought to do on</font>

1301
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:39,189
a networker environment we play a lot of

1302
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:40,420
defense but we can go ahead and put

1303
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,430
points on the board we can kick our

1304
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,630
adversaries out and we can scrimmage

1305
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:47,620
with them that's what a capture<font color="#CCCCCC"> the flag</font>

1306
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:49,630
is Reggie White awesome the minister of

1307
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:52,750
defense<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then Khalil Mack</font>

1308

he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a terror on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Raiders any</font>

1309

<font color="#CCCCCC">put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ray lewis in here but you get the</font>

1310
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:58,059
point these are defenders<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1311
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,930
materially change the game so defense is

1312
00:47:58,059 --> 00:48:00,910
evolving<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think it's really</font>

1314
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:05,500
my team so what all right Ben what are

1315
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:08,558
these new design pattern give me like a

1316
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:10,359
summary here why is defense cool we're

1317
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,119
not talking about popping shells and

defensive stuff 0 tough snap trust

1321

networking with sidecars that can handle

1322

connections across mesh networks and do

1323

signing and security for you Canaries

1324

1332
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,660
think I've hit that one an awful stop

1333
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:48,460
quantum resistant cryptography doing

1334
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:50,410
really good choices on public key crypto

1335
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">some point I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our essays a</font>

to evolve more in public<font color="#E5E5E5"> e private key</font>

were generally cool the only real

1340
00:48:57,099 --> 00:49:00,910
quantum issue there's Grover's algorithm

1341
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:03,400
which is exhaustive t-shirt key search

1342

1344

layer seven logging so great you get

1345
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,519
bugs for free i think that is awesome

1346
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:14,049
moving left that's security testing in

1347
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:16,930
your build or development process like

here inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDE should be fixing</font>

1350
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,379
bugs not when it's done production we

1351
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,359
talked about geofencing<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about</font>

malware and see what it's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1357
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:39,849
figure out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to respond to</font>

1358
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:41,950
without causing an issue TLS 13 awesome

1359
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:43,809
stuff please use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then adaptive</font>

1360
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:45,609
defense a defense is not static it has

1361
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:48,250
to evolve based on the threat it should

1362
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:50,650
scrimmage but still defenses awesome i'm

1363
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,599
proud to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense and i work with</font>

pen testers<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're fun too but it's not</font>

1365
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:58,000
my jam so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've got five minutes left I</font>

1366
00:49:55,690 --> 00:50:00,400
didn't get the fist pound here but five

1367
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,539
minutes why don't I stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't all</font>

1368
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,730
appendix we're not going to go through

1369
00:50:01,539 --> 00:50:03,410
it

1370
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:32,150
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stopped for a couple</font>

1371
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:33,830
questions no questions sir so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1372
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:36,140
much a leading practice or emerging

1373
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:38,720
praxis not super common if you have

1374
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:40,069
legacy infrastructure so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font>

1375
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,779
talked earlier about an old

00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,160
manufacturing selling how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1377
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,960
become immutable the answer they really

1378
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:49,399
can't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment that often deal with</font>

1379
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,720
it this for greenfield deployments can

1380
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,130
you retrofitted sure if you're using

1381
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,419
docker and you're using really good

1382
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:56,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtualization you can apply the</font>

1383
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:58,640
principles but it is harder to do if you

1384
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have microservices load balancers</font>

1385
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,790
docker<font color="#CCCCCC"> in kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a green field</font>

1386
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,320
environment so it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1387
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:06,380
aspirational<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to be honest there</font>

1388
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,780
but as your vendors give you solutions

1389
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,280
ask them can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do this in a beautiful</font>

1390
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,470
architecture make your vendor answer

1391
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,960
that for you or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're green fielding</font>

1392
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:16,069
a nap try and do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that use it as a design</font>

1393
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,500
pattern that you're stretching<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1394
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:19,940
achieve it is hard to retrofit on the

1395
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,740
windows NT that's sitting around in an

1396
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:23,900
old company but that's why you<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment</font>

1397
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,339
that off so it's a leading practice if

1398
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,050
you have technical debt or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't</font>
