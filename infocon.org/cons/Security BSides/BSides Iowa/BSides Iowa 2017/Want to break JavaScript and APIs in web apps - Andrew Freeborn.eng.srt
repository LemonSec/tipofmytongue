<font color="#CCCCCC">the things and today we're going to talk</font>

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:35,210
about breaking JavaScript and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and</font>

4
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:38,820
without the new hotness so no we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

5
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:42,000
all about me now as you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I to</font>

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,019
and so a lot of pain cooking and a lot

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,350
of dank memes<font color="#CCCCCC"> much kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one best for</font>

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,940
but also tested security and web apps

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,120
and mobile apps and all kinds of

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,030
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> in both web app mobile testing</font>

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">and as well as a client and skated</font>

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,409
memories I love a different kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of CPU</font>

14
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,750
architectures and gain the dank memes

15
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:06,690
you know current<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper is a ebook Kermit</font>

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:12,570
so I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of keeps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it going and who</font>

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:14,580
doesn't love<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so today you know kind</font>

18
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,919
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of agenda I you know</font>

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,090
cut-up out the y at the top and kind of

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,830
looking if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about and</font>

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even motivations with this kind of</font>

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,320
talk and then tools to identify and I

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,060
break the all the things not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,949
things but may thinks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I'm going</font>

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take a break if we have tools to</font>

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,049
break stuff and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a demo</font>

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:41,130
so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we'll</font>

28
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:43,649
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how that goes so why as you can see</font>

29
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,439
here on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the picture there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

30
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,960
colors here for<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

31
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,000
and just within the corporate or even

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,759
small business environment yes of the

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,399
Julian kinds of jQuery<font color="#CCCCCC"> angular mustache</font>

34
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,859
that them you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the things</font>

35
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,049
you know work very well for a specific

36
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,719
use case that business may use it for

37
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,909
but how often are we evaluating that

38
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,788
specific version of jQuery is saying oh

39
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,320
we're on 1.6 we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> really be on the</font>

40
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,839
next version for variety reasons the

41
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,620
dumper says well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> pots money time and</font>

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,660
say well because security<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should so</font>

43
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,700
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the CD that our</font>

codes a ton of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> varieties of</font>

45
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,140
JavaScript frameworks in use today and

46
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,030
it's only going to get worse as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

47
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,339
the response cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> new thing to play with</font>

48
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,530
and develop it and then using<font color="#E5E5E5"> production</font>

49
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,200
and trying to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of that so as</font>

50
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,750
security people we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,849
that we're aware of this new burgeoning

52
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,349
format of<font color="#E5E5E5"> incorporating different</font>

53
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,329
versions of javascript in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

54
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,799
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> in production and how we're</font>

55
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,290
aware of these kind of frameworks and

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,620
making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know that you know</font>

57
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,480
we do our best<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really be aware kind</font>

58
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,950
of that the ball rolling of being

59
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">updating secure but really really no</font>

60
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,750
reason with a javascript is a problem

61
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:05,390
because it's evil so the bane of Oliver

62
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:07,790
Oh bane of our existence so you know

63
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,250
really with what type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of developers on</font>

64
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,380
assessments<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an oz version of jQuery</font>

65
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> mustache and they say why we</font>

66
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,329
outdated let me state because<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,299
but really it's a problem that not only

68
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we face in our organization but any</font>

69
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,769
kind of place where you find a highly

70
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,450
deployed product you're going to have a

71
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:28,250
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people looking putting miles on</font>

72
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and if that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actor is trying to</font>

73
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,540
exploit that it just adds a fight that

74
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,420
wants WordPress and how to happen or are

75
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,828
they update and keep on top of their

76
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,420
platform to make sure that they're

77
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:44,090
secure and so commonly you're going to

78
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,280
see you know always<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel of lovis porn</font>

79
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,430
abilities we see all this version of

80
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,989
jQuery it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a high you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

81
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:55,670
high risk to the organization but<font color="#E5E5E5"> scum a</font>

82
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:59,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">low risk oh now we see a low-risk can</font>

83
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:02,750
say a the lab kind of information but

84
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,049
again that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> low risk and OEM we see</font>

85
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,790
all these different of vulnerabilities

86
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,920
well when we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing lots of different</font>

87
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,350
vulnerabilities somebody can be very

88
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,358
clever and chain all those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

89
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,820
use all horn abilities to help make an

90
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:19,310
exploitation so like an Airbnb here in

91
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,159
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> article you see that all these were</font>

92
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:25,849
low vulnerabilities but chained together

93
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,349
this compromise air baby so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

94
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,150
businessman safe well it's a low-risk

95
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:31,099
what's hit that wears cannot really wear

96
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,169
too much about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> though but it's not</font>

97
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:34,760
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Flores perform abilities you</font>

98
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:37,760
could become in a higher situation and

99
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,760
be compromised so we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be aware</font>

100
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,010
that yeah we can accept this risk but we

101
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,080
need to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're aware that</font>

102
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,090
the more things we accept the more risk

103
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,630
we're at

104
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:53,549
and so not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only are we seeing JavaScript</font>

105
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:57,690
use a lot we're also seeing HP is use a

106
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:59,610
lot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's great for a developer has</font>

107
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,400
great to have api<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to have a lot of</font>

108
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,139
cross compatibility between platforms to

109
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,530
share the data naturally what businesses

110
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,750
want to do is consume and use and have

111
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,388
it via readily available tell people to

112
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,539
use and consume be you know invested in

113
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,460
their platform so a common platform for

114
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:21,539
you guys of you know it's currently

115
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:24,030
start out to rest and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am saying</font>

116
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,400
firmly management company or say I'm

117
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:30,000
event company that uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're blade</font>

118
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,770
management data I can get data from one

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,509
vendors tool and then they're from

120
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,299
another person's tool and then combine

121
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:38,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">that these anarchy is but if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I is</font>

122
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">again our software and has their own</font>

123
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:44,699
challenges unfortunately with<font color="#E5E5E5"> API is its</font>

124
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:47,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of seeing as like a habit they the</font>

125
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,319
question as far as how do we make sure

126
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,539
that each Isaac here and who is snapping

127
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:55,409
it and making sure it is secure me would

128
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:58,199
say it guys up I hope it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

129
00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:01,110
hope it's secure but it's not rly

130
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,300
amateur part of is a carrier scary

131
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,710
testing methodology to make sure that

132
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,870
we're just hammering that each time

133
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,789
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're were kind of shaking down</font>

134
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,650
as possible a little hanging fruit and

135
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:13,050
it different and that as much as

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,949
so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> for first time we're seeing API</font>

144
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,419
is specifically called out as a problem

145
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:41,520
that you know we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure the</font>

146
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,719
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 problem that were just you know</font>

147
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,590
we're seeing the apartment we're not way

148
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:49,409
testing very thoroughly so again making

149
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,330
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or you know a thing that</font>

150
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to test and break and</font>

151
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,810
manipulate and see if it you know

152
00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:01,139
behaves as it should and with

153
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:03,580
the results that we want so the best way

154
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,760
to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little hacking is with chrome</font>

155
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:10,270
and really you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> chrome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> firefox</font>

156
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">developer tools are crazy awesome it was</font>

157
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,340
up look more about that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> retired jas</font>

158
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:19,388
it's a platform as well and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> note</font>

159
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:22,659
security and think again<font color="#CCCCCC"> two great tools</font>

160
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:25,860
will cover in postman an API developer

161
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,630
tool mostly and a vertebral venerable

162
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,820
virtually you know purpose so you know

163
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,460
well today's load centers in 45 years

164
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so he's in barfi know in this</font>

165
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">use case is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still very valid and you</font>

166
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:45,610
know a vital part of anybody's tool a

167
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:48,940
tool set so again with chrome and

168
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,770
firefox you know we come as we saw and

169
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,440
brass talk that<font color="#E5E5E5"> chrome has a large share</font>

170
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,359
of the market and so developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> hobbies</font>

171
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">forget you know compatibility with</font>

172
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,140
chrome and firefox and sometimes the

173
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:05,860
internet explorer sometimes but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

174
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:08,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">both firefox and with chrome they bundle</font>

175
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,660
in the baseline version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> elephants and</font>

176
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,490
so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> other tools are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agree to have</font>

177
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,190
you know a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bugging</font>

178
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,650
capabilities introspection wasting

179
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:20,560
manipulate and resend and just basically

180
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,989
wreak havoc with any website you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as</font>

181
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,120
a common use early to say i'll check

182
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,490
them an email but the tests<font color="#CCCCCC"> or either</font>

183
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bible tool is that if i'm on engagement</font>

184
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,380
or am at a client site this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a great</font>

185
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,750
tool because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not come come we saw</font>

186
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">as like a threat or a way to compromise</font>

187
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:40,599
website but you know as a kind of that

188
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,280
hurdle of knowledge and acceptance of

189
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,950
you know you see developer tools against

190
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:47,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to make sure you know we're also</font>

191
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,260
doing our job and it's a lot of places

192
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,470
available from google I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox's</font>

193
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,910
tool to walk through the tools and how

194
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,660
they work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and understand how you'd be</font>

195
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,040
debugging and respecting and I really

196
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,709
get to know it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a bad</font>

197
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,079
works will set and then why is it easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

198
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a variety issues</font>

199
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,990
being quickly and use of death rules I

200
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,640
can see headers I can see all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

201
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,640
methods<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do a lot of different</font>

202
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and validate security and see if</font>

203
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,290
like the base that bare basics are being

204
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,229
done like are we enabling cookies or

205
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,730
reason ssl only so a lot mullet<font color="#CCCCCC"> lalaine</font>

206
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fruit can quickly be identified</font>

207
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:29,570
without busting out verb or these are

208
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,250
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools I'm getting used to help</font>

209
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,410
we'll hang<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fruit so just being with</font>

210
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:41,430
these tools themselves we accomplished a

211
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:45,930
great deal of testing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what testing</font>

212
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:47,729
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have if we usually</font>

213
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:51,089
schools we can quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the source</font>

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:53,790
code for all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript files CSS</font>

215
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,830
and timers like that so developers are a

216
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,680
lot of fun they'll leave comments don't

217
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">do a lot of things that necessarily you</font>

218
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,280
know don't worry impact the<font color="#CCCCCC"> users</font>

or people's names or when it was change

or what<font color="#CCCCCC"> for mobility was addressed or</font>

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,440
comma doubt source code that doesn't you

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,340
know you know I'll stick it out later

225

but let over for whatever reason so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

can see and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top part here we can see</font>

all the in the routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this angular</font>

the first one administration so we're

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,510
going to stay up off the bat can see the

administrative portal that you know he

scoreboard that's interesting but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

238
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,240
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is that doesn't need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the code for the source or the</font>

source code let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it out does no</font>

241
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,340
harm to us at all it's only gives the

242
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,800
attack for more information to our

00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:08,450
chained together can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you know exploit</font>

exploit 80

248
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:15,510
so when we do look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the source what</font>

249
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,320
the time it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last words like three</font>

252
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,900
us is pretty print become the strong

253
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:33,150
braces we get on the right a much better

254
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,860
and easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read version of the source</font>

255
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,880
code that you know formatted very nicely

256
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,650
for us and helps us quickly you know

257
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,740
review<font color="#CCCCCC"> the source code for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

258
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">look for and you know from our point of</font>

259
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,820
view for doing source for analysis or

260
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,080
whatever we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be doing we can</font>

261
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,440
have a much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> view of the source</font>

262
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,910
code so i highly recommend if you can

263
00:11:52,440 --> 00:12:02,390
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the source dude pretty print</font>

264
00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:05,040
always so for attacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus tools and</font>

265
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:10,050
information gathering I<font color="#CCCCCC"> too i like to</font>

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:12,000
call i use is our retired ijs so

at github and<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrigley update has a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">mustache and so we see the maintainer to</font>

274
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,970
go through there and say up version 1.5

275
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,800
in ALB horrible to this thing you know

276
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,970
upgrade to where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> package you know</font>

277
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,270
says to use and a lot of times with this

278
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:48,180
tool and others will be a specific of

279
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:50,880
disclosures of articles and the specific

280
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,579
reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> that library is learnable</font>

281
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,960
let's say sequel injection or deny on

282
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:00,450
service or regex exploit its all using

283

have you know all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the englert files are</font>

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,560
angular at that place why is horrible

322
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:13,260
kind of what they assess the risk to be

323
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,790
and be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful for screenshots</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:24,660
help<font color="#CCCCCC"> relieve these issues but the more</font>

328
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,760
the command line so let me see here

329
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,820
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the command line getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

333
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,209
injection problems so again you can see

334
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,839
like the note security to<font color="#CCCCCC"> IO advisory</font>

335
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:55,160
linking to that version of civilized and

336
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,160
the problem associated with that library

337
00:15:55,319 --> 00:16:02,618
and also calling out to more tools the

338
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:07,779
operate basically is the same way you

339
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:10,540
know basically excuse me the first one

340
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:14,379
is a note security platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> project from</font>

341
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:19,179
a lift and actually I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here I</font>

342
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:20,980
make dark excuse my fingers he helps

343
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:24,819
maintain this project<font color="#E5E5E5"> air base in Iowa</font>

344
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:27,309
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know maintains I kind advisories</font>

345
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:31,419
it's a lot of tools like our retire and

346
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:34,238
I think and SP<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course well reference</font>

347
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:36,279
no security advisories and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

348
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:39,819
people you know additional crowd source

00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:42,999
version you know crowdsourced<font color="#E5E5E5"> pilot or e</font>

350
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:44,949
of information again it's a it's game

351
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:49,779
set direct reducing the JSON files and

352
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:52,358
uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> d no packages as well and think it's</font>

353
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:55,179
pretty cool to think you can basically

354
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:58,809
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to scan</font>

testing but forestry people like me it's

378
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,669
also a great tool because we make sure

379
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,950
helpers are doomed they should be doing

00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,970
for an API and sitting outside you know

401
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,429
a variety of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> on queries and</font>

can quickly reiterate quickly through

415
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,730
different kind of testing scenarios

416
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,639
saving me time so not problem we see

417
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,040
with having<font color="#E5E5E5"> client high security</font>

so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not ways as well that</font>

validate that the back end is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

423
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">annihilation testing as well so I mean</font>

424
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,080
if you're lying only the client if

425
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,370
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using a client to be pretty</font>

426
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,909
hard to have that control there to

427
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:03,370
protect the application itself so the

428
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,690
postman music<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the postman comes to be</font>

429
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,919
done in zapper and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of different</font>

430
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:12,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways but it's keeping that in mind as a</font>

431
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,770
writer writing up the report say well to

432
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,809
rely solely on clients are controls that

433
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,940
can be common style or<font color="#CCCCCC"> bypass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> entirely</font>

434
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:22,780
so definitely having that defense in

435
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:26,640
depth layer of protection health

436
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,639
validate both sides of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that transaction</font>

437
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:35,260
so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mitch hassel about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Burt so</font>

438
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,980
very cool as a great tool for proxying

439
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:41,470
requests and dream assessments and you

440
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,440
know it's still pretty cheap at 399 per

441
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,000
user but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the free version is very</font>

442
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,340
well it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of the</font>

443
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">features in the pearl and a lot of the</font>

444
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:55,030
extensions and burp require pearl but

445
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:57,190
completely worth it as a tester or even

446
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:01,990
a internal organization definitely

447
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:04,809
should be a center tool used but if not

448
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:07,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Zack isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our tool as well but you know</font>

449
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:10,139
if by all means please get bourbon and

450
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,140
trial two things

451
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:19,379
bubble tools are consuming updated with

452
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,539
new features and functionalities as the

453
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:23,698
web sites themselves change with more

454
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:25,589
WebSocket based communications and kind

455
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:28,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">of different API is and kind of keeping</font>

456
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:33,799
up with the times with the ever-changing

457
00:21:28,949 --> 00:21:38,509
landscape so we see again the screenshot

458
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:42,658
we see this a website transaction we see

459
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:45,959
that there's a put operation put option

460
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:47,819
available that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this transaction if</font>

461
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:51,259
you see on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom there it's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

462
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:55,109
hard to see you see a quantity and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

463
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:56,219
so as again<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we're attaching security</font>

464
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:58,198
we should be a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

465
00:21:56,219 --> 00:22:01,379
limiting what kind of operation of

466
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:03,149
options we limit to transaction do we

467
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:05,728
allow put the delete and update on

468
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:08,639
everything or only on certain operations

469
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:10,949
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will allow getting posts or just</font>

470
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:12,569
even get so we're going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> mindful of</font>

471
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:15,359
how the developers allowing people to

472
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:17,489
communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the application and if</font>

473
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,978
they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'll be firing on all</font>

474
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:22,049
output but puts a very dangerous

475
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:25,019
operation as<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we've put information</font>

476
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:29,339
back onto the system or delete you know

477
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:31,679
the same way take off the server so to

478
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:33,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure that as we're assessing being</font>

479
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,269
mindful of<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the options available</font>

480
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:39,359
to us if I were to do a put operation

481
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:41,309
instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a get would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that work and why</font>

482
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,309
not you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> why wouldn't it work so</font>

483
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:49,168
kind of why not ask you to like miss fry

484
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:54,029
it puts a 404 or denied he's you

485
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:58,409
subscribe so finally the thing to break

486
00:22:54,029 --> 00:23:01,169
is the OAuth juice<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw so the new job is</font>

487
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:04,049
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> intentionally insecure about that for</font>

488
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:08,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">scary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> training kind of sensing town</font>

489
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:10,469
helping people<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to habit of how I</font>

490
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:13,010
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a JavaScript based application</font>

491
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:16,010
with API is and how I break that

492
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:19,870
kind of motivation for this was my last

493
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:23,870
location last position miles asked to

494
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:27,320
pen test this this new product and this

495
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:30,070
a userform the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Future Forum was entirely</font>

496
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,629
done a JavaScript and head api's and so

497
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:35,750
you know did the testing but I thought

498
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:37,970
like as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community how if I</font>

499
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,370
had never seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript only</font>

500
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:43,220
applications that had api's how did I

501
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,870
learn this how would I try to understand

502
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,150
the problems associated this in the safe

503
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:50,120
environment and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this you</font>

504
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:52,220
know you know better my skills to you

505
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,580
know learn as kind of particular you're

506
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:57,380
growing fields of web apps so I'll

507
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,649
finally found the OS juice shop that

508
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,660
does just that and you know it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

509
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">word great application is constantly</font>

510
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:09,020
updated by ort meek and timid Nick and

511
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,880
even has a CTF version as well so you

512
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,620
know pretty cool thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well but we'll</font>

513
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,540
see kind of how there's a committee CTF

514
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,129
in it already but it knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

515
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,670
different strategy as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> for having</font>

516
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:21,800
like open a shop a CTF or with the local

CTF focused updates in foreign abilities

521
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,050
and to that 26 and the author recommends

522
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,460
are not cheating but it's kind of

523
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,590
interesting point you know not skiing

524
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,240
well that guys don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that I</font>

525
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,260
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that guy was like oh my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gosh I</font>

526
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,510
shouldn't cheat I should go to the

527
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,800
github well they will I mean they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

528
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,180
going to talk about in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad guys</font>

530
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,200
put the main application I shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

531
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,830
to use postman or should try to I'd use

532
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,140
API in a bad way so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me by all</font>

533
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,850
means do it anything you can to break it

534
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,890
you know try to learn brick as fast as

535
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,320
soon as possible in fact

536

00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:56,480
need any kind of BM or if I at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

554
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:58,760
today excuse me I'll be running this on

555
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:04,150
a docker container or I can run the

556
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:08,120
cloud on AWS or on your own vm excuse me

557
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:11,900
so for my machine for my demo I'm just

558
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:14,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">running on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a basic Ubuntu 1604 LTS or so</font>

559
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:17,750
nothing paying fees nothing impossible

560
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:20,270
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to spin up download and kind</font>

561
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,800
of get familiar with using unity<font color="#E5E5E5"> so long</font>

562
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">Libby duty but that's a full term</font>

563
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:27,940
discussion so download the ISO<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it up</font>

564
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,710
into a sudo apt-get update and upgrade

565
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:34,310
and then installing a docker the latest

566
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,660
dr. CD versions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a great</font>

567
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:39,260
set of instructions are very

568
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:41,690
straightforward you know let<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say less</font>

569
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,400
than two minutes of work 9-5 two minutes

570
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,820
you know not counting that download time

571
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,850
in the update update time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had system</font>

572
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:53,960
ready to download to run the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jew shell</font>

573
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:56,600
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can fall a doctor pull</font>

574
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">down the doctor image of juice shop dr.</font>

575
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">run and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those primers for back</font>

576
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,050
rounding and wearing a port 3000 with

577
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,030
that image name with an image of juice

578
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:07,190
shop and you have it running you have it

579
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:08,840
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> leopard of do anything else</font>

580
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,730
right make sure i patch is cool or

581
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,590
anything like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to robot</font>

582
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,740
permissions yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm ready to rock and</font>

583
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,740
roll

584
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:21,990
so sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll see a lot of things</font>

585
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:24,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">like best local three or different kind</font>

586
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,400
of versions of intentionally insecure

587
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,080
web apps they kind of say go ahead

588
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,310
finding the vulnerabilities that's kind

589
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,030
of part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the learning process right</font>

590
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:35,940
well after<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anil its kind of Timothy you</font>

591
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:38,100
know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of you once and so no no</font>

592
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,170
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say oh yeah is we should</font>

593
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">do first this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how you look at second</font>

594
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,010
this is how you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to figure out</font>

595
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,040
without giving the answer how to solve

596
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:49,620
this challenge so in companion with this

597
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,230
project there's the opponent a lot of

598
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:54,000
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> book so posting the pathology</font>

599
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:57,450
of walking the dog of going through the

600
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,160
website and click on the things cholera

601
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,350
fiber or<font color="#CCCCCC"> regular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user how do I use</font>

602
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,690
application kind of first understanding

603
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:06,090
how I would use did you shop in<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal</font>

604
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">setting and then as an attacker how</font>

605
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,919
diets are attacking it so the

606
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,000
vulnerabilities are like a lock on an

607
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:16,820
sss to popping alert one that's great

608
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,890
still happens in production but still

609
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:22,919
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get deeper and have more</font>

610
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:24,870
real kind of very similar attacks you

611
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,150
would see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are more nested and</font>

612
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,520
harder to get to so with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

613
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:31,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">project definitely achieves that you</font>

know find fun sequel Egyptian problems

615
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,720
and like tiered XSS problems without

616
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:39,240
using the front application like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

617
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,980
earlier using postman to help bypass

618
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:46,860
those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of quiet I restrictions that</font>

619
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:49,410
we usually bypass using the API so it it

620
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:54,780
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a reflection of the more</font>

623
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,700
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application kind of see how</font>

624
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,610
it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> walk through and then</font>

625
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,410
we'll go through some vulnerabilities

626
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,699
and load the steamer with the book they

627
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,890
say that go through the scoreboard and

628
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,300
trying to find that and then we'll try

629
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you know go through these 14</font>

630
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:14,460
abilities and

631
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:34,679
see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bill any questions so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far or</font>

comments means especially is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> reigns</font>

633
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:40,410
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> still commercial tools versus</font>

634
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,300
a free and low-cost tools as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

great school but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that's good</font>

637
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,900
for more point and shoot and as well as

638
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:51,000
honest with you know for an automated

639
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,620
testing scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> but follow up with as</font>

640
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,300
well may know testing kind i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have ever</font>

641
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,340
contain them with like say one user

642
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,770
account using that you know the apps can

643
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,540
to help skin and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> using never camp</font>

644
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,570
with a ripper zap and kind of figuring

645
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,980
out like you know from at the same time

646
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:07,139
you know he's no tools as well but you

647
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,500
know they work great too is just as far

648
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,000
as you know how you coupled with then

649
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,660
kind of put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time into like open</font>

650
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,150
tools but yeah i like burp a lot there's

651
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,070
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of mail this repair petition and</font>

652
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,260
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> run through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apps and then the apps</font>

653
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:27,389
game is really good too I'll find a lot

654
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">of cool things soon anything else all</font>

655
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:42,809
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> dope so I'm going to pop right</font>

656
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:44,900
over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> AA vmware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh darn fi what's it</font>

00:30:46,390 --> 00:31:06,169
all right one second almost there right

659
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:15,139
thoughtful<font color="#CCCCCC"> look all right so you know a</font>

660
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:16,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">very basic application where we see that</font>

661
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,460
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just quickly spin up on a</font>

662
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,720
standard a blue tuned machine so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

663
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:29,299
have chromium installed in here and

664
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:35,289
especially been hard outside would be so

665
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:40,029
you know the basic setup for running

666
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:40,029
this box will running this version of

whew

668
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:57,559
running the docker image as simple as

669
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:03,139
well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned running the Justice</font>

670
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:07,460
command so copy that real quick back to

671
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:09,970
our terminal paste that in not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:37,350
our basket and a sinner ecommerce

680
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:38,820
website so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't really do a whole</font>

681
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:42,169
lot from here without creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

682
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:54,379
account<font color="#E5E5E5"> so first we'll create an account</font>

683
00:32:42,170 --> 00:33:00,960
log on register Andy 80.com super secret

684
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:06,270
spring 2017 I'll be uh I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed to</font>

685

our website and we're just go ahead and

687
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:15,440
we can see a product description through

you know I'll all along the whole entire

697
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,550
way there's about bajillion for

698
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:47,070
abilities that will soon discover so

699
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:49,350
even the those is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> similarly simple</font>

700
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:51,419
website there's so many issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pops</font>

701
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:53,820
nur of you know available to us to help

discover that will soon see that you

703
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:59,129
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> may seem simple and short but has a</font>

704
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,870
lot of opportunity for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to learning</font>

705
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:07,170
investigate so earlier we mentioned

706
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:08,520
there's a scoreboard and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't</font>

707
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,950
read the book and if I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

708
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,960

second college is really cool this

731
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:25,038
weekend some production now oh great

732
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:27,380
what's the assessed not really so we go

733
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,569
through here and just like quickly

fine one day so we scroll through header

738

night interesting you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

739
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:45,710
see the log on which we saw earlier blog

740
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:47,029
out now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Fenech ated the</font>

00:35:47,029 --> 00:35:50,690

00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:54,490
French and all those different languages

744
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:58,160

<font color="#E5E5E5">always like to say what does that do is</font>

748
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:12,460
it still<font color="#CCCCCC"> lion is it living is it</font>

749
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:17,180
accessible so let's get rid of search

750
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:19,700
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> CEO always been checking things</font>

751
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,710
out we see his scoreboard and hopefully

752
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,529
we see these green will pop up at the

753
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:27,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">very top showing what challenge what we</font>

754
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:29,690
have solved so here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see we saw</font>

755
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:31,910
the very first challenge of discovering

756
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:34,220
the scoreboard associated with this

757
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,509
project so the scoreboard that's for

758
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,089
kind of various challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> at different</font>

759
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:40,850
levels difficulties that help us to

760
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:42,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand really like to know the level</font>

761
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:44,990
of effort you know to like help find

762
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of problems so this problem</font>

763
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,950
is really kind of highlighting the you

764
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,990
know the ease of availability of funding

765
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:53,810
comedy a code<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we will still have</font>

766
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:55,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">dead code or a forgotten website that</font>

767
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:58,310
may be vulnerable that was forgotten

768
00:36:55,610 --> 00:37:00,020
about not removed and this will pose a

769
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:05,000
problem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the website will to the</font>

770
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:07,220
company Sophie<font color="#CCCCCC"> ff5 or refresh that we</font>

771
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,810
see now this is now solved the

772
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:12,470
scoreboard challenge is now solved with

773
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:14,960
this difficulty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of once darn so with</font>

774
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:18,560
docker you could commit changes and kind

775
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:24,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">of snapshot the painter but or if you</font>

776
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:26,120
know your reboot or in kind of change

777
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:27,560
like that equals your progress so the

778
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,900
nice thing about this as well as we

779
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:33,560
consider progress I believe it's a code

780
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:35,930
and can restore so if we know the rubber

781
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,990
boot or<font color="#CCCCCC"> where new maybe we can save our</font>

782
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:41,120
progress and you come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to it and has</font>

783
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:45,319
you know the same number challenges

784
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:47,630
unlocked so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next challenge is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

785
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:50,270
proven of providing air<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not very</font>

786
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:54,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">gracefully handled so the best place to</font>

787
00:37:50,270 --> 00:38:00,140
do that is in anywhere there's a text so

788
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:02,899
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start hacking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hackney ' you</font>

789
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:05,410
know possibly is best way to hack so we

790
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:10,210
click enter we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this leet hack</font>

791
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:13,399
resulted in a knockout not graceful I

792
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:14,930
air we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here the console that</font>

793
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:20,859
we've got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 500</font>

794
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:20,859
I was the apostrophe at the very end

795
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:28,940
yeah yes I'll talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sonia a lot hacks</font>

796
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:32,059
has a hatch first in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> posture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piece</font>

797
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:34,059
it runs faster that way and you can see

798
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:36,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we had a glacial error here that</font>

799
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:38,210
console kind of gave me this new all it

800
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,089
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very helpful and kind of</font>

801
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:47,540
helpless understand oh wow that's cool

802
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:49,160
so we'll go back to our scoreboard we

803
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,700
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now we have to challenge is</font>

804
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,190
done so apostrophes are<font color="#CCCCCC"> comely and</font>

805
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,259
you'll use to help new sequel injection

806
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:00,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a sequel injection is a way to help</font>

807
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:03,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">lied break out those queries to a</font>

808
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:05,420
database with information or any kind of

809
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,430
way to help you know circumvent kind

810
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,069
controls and make that<font color="#CCCCCC"> position to what</font>

811
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:12,250
was intended to do so that's why I do i

812
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:14,599
do the poss refuse to help show up

813
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:18,109
generally officially handled it's not

814
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:22,250
going to be good news for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

815
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:24,230
application and so again another way you

816
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:28,430
know another fun thing that we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

817
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:30,650
is do the infamous alert one box again

818
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:33,618
to the attack them put it feels so let's

819
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:39,319
trust morally<font color="#E5E5E5"> acts and we'll just do a</font>

820
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:42,950
script Oh at first about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenge</font>

821
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:45,170
so we have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> SS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> str1 so for the Tier</font>

822
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:51,740
one performer reflected excess attacked

823
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:57,190
with this specific script so kind of

824
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:57,189
lazy so this is copy

825
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,350
scrolls

826
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:13,890
oh that's the test one nice so here we

827
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:16,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">see again the green box it's pretty</font>

828
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:19,440
sweet I pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much to be done by now</font>

829
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">what's a million dollars lovely hacks</font>

830
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,650
but this is great opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn</font>

831
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:27,630
the different kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bowl</font>

832
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:29,549

00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">help provide you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know to like the</font>

know<font color="#CCCCCC"> forth that's really or trying to</font>

839
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:45,630
accomplish here and kind of understand

840
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:48,599
that you know for these kind of problems

841
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:51,410
it's not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take much rocket</font>

842
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,730
science to try to understand that like

843
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,259
developers diddly do their job of due

844
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,609
diligence to make sure that these kind

845
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,289
of things were not scrubbed out through

846
00:40:56,609 --> 00:40:59,940
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> side or even server side</font>

847
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:02,490
validation checks of character and

848
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,950
sanitization so we need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

849
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:07,618
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we help communicate with preferably</font>

850
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:08,669
a demo of this how easy is<font color="#CCCCCC"> perform this</font>

851
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:11,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of attacks to kind of communicate</font>

852
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:20,150
that kind of threat to the organization

853
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:23,160
and so on interest of time we know that

854
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:24,779
with these developer tools you can see

855
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,910
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different kinds of source code</font>

856
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:34,619
associated with the application itself

857
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:38,609
so we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's the picture</font>

858
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:40,890
awkward<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see again this long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stream of</font>

859
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:42,990
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I've read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really fast</font>

860
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:46,440
but I can't read that fast to help me

861
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:50,788
except in a disinformation so again that

862
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:55,470
pretty print print please boom we have

863
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:57,240
now the cleaner and workable aversion to

864
00:41:55,470 --> 00:42:02,759
offer be the source of foreign kind of

865
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:05,220
nasties or anything like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

866
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,410
scroll down where we're looking we're

867
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,319
looking we're

868
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:11,960
and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we see all the routes</font>

869
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:15,160
associated with this website route

870
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,829
slight change password and things like

871
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:23,259
administration<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that's pretty sweet I</font>

872
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:23,260

874
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:33,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into its kind of portal all the good</font>

875
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:36,288
you know prevention that methodology is

876
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:38,839
helping to prevent that nope there's the

877
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:40,250
administrator portal so you know again

878
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:42,980
this that helps look for authentication

879
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:45,319
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> history of users</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i just created that</font>

Andy user as a basic user I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font>

881
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to the MS rate portal the problem is</font>

882
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,359
now a mystery point of view I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font>

883
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,109
all the edge account associated with

884
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:59,509
this website and if he would be back I

885
00:42:57,109 --> 00:43:02,598
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I should see as a regular</font>

886
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:04,010
user so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> occation and kind of those</font>

887
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:07,520
kind of control that should be in place

888
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:10,609
and test and validated so one of the

889
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,920
challenges is to remove all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suite</font>

890
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:14,980
five star feedback and see one five star

891
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,329
feedback a four star to star force star

892
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:22,220
well as another<font color="#E5E5E5"> user I shouldn't be able</font>

893
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:25,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to delete anything in this portal but I</font>

894
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:27,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see what's in our</font>

challenge delete all the five star

896
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:33,589
feedback and so it's really start

897
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,420
wrecking things just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only use in</font>

938
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:43,319
thing else that should be removed as a

about a dumper tools right click copy

965
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:24,160
copy as a curl so cruel could be used to

966
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:27,490
the command line to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you create the</font>

for produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know being paid and I</font>

997
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:56,820
goes ahead and solve the challenge you

998
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:58,870
can see it right here of let's see

999
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:03,070
successfully he'll challenge payback

1000
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:05,109
time listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes you rich so</font>

1001
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:07,750
as we're exploring website you kind of

1002
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:10,060
look for interesting URLs and so when we

1003
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:12,820
make an order it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hard to see</font>

1004
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:16,500
up here but right after the orders made

1005
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:21,430
we see a website for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the IP</font>

1006
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:24,430
the port and we also see flash ftp why

1007
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:26,259
what orders<font color="#CCCCCC"> you serve off at mt p</font>

1008
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:30,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">website why would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i receive to be served</font>

1009
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:32,580
out there let's browse it boom that's a

1010
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:35,910
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cool things in their receive and</font>

1011
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:38,200
so here with the all kinds of things lie

1012
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:41,410
package.json that back file as a backup

1013
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:43,330
file bar<font color="#CCCCCC"> json so this is all inventory</font>

1014
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:45,399
of all the libraries and packages no

1015
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:46,900
packages used on our website so that

1016
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,210
shouldn't be there which shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> CB</font>

1017
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,340
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my orders I've made you know</font>

1018
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:52,840
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the normal portal but we also</font>

1019
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:56,260
see all these other files that we

1020
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:58,090
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to see so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font>

1021
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:59,440
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> browse them we can see a lot of</font>

1022
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like all the things we</font>

1023
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">should not be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see like this</font>

1024
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:09,340
should not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available to us this were</font>

1025
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:11,170
a real file and so you know it's

1026
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:13,210
exploring kind of prodding and touching

1027
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:15,880
all the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to us we</font>

1028
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,380
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we're testing all</font>

1029
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,020
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't wait you know</font>

1030
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:24,310
would not accept a normal user to do but

1031
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:25,720
potentially could do and so there's a

1032
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:28,299
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more explore there's a ton more</font>

1033
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,189
challenges to explore and understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1034
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,890
learn and the book and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1035
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:34,600
websites available as well to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1037
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,420
challenges

1038
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:40,759
I progressively kind of issue towards

1039
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:43,520
trying to learn like without giving you

1040
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">the answer what to look for how to look</font>

1041
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,210
for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you would test them and</font>

1042
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:49,490
just explore the website more and more

1043
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,820
and keep on going so this thing myself

1044
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:55,069
us would<font color="#CCCCCC"> may a cts and cool way to learn</font>

1045
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:58,250
ways to break JavaScript API is and just

1046
00:50:55,070 --> 00:51:03,020
keep on going to harder and more full

1047
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:09,340
challenges and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's great</font>

1048
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:11,720
for you know messing around with oops

1049
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,670
that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> for messing around with you</font>

1050
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,069
know play things and kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know</font>

1051
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:21,560
hopefully in production might see some

1052
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:22,940
of the things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> also as support where</font>

1053
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,700
else you might see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

1054
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:28,280
challenges well effective security has

1055
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,810
these kind of different challenges with

1056
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,740
you know Lisa certifications with the

1057
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:37,790
offensive security certifications and so

1058
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,870
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the OSCE you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

1059
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:43,310
the courses they have is correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1060
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:45,920
perimeter and so to get into the crack

1061
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:47,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">the perimeter course need to help do</font>

1062
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,400
these kind of challenges the first break

1063
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:52,430
through these challenges because<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1064
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,800
easy to tell what you know austech yep I

1065
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:57,710
know these skills I can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> through like</font>

1066
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,360
this kind of shakedown things help you

1067
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:01,100
kind of prove like I'd not have some

1068
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:04,820
knowledge of these kind of technologies

1069
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:06,920
and ways to break in and right here they

1070
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:09,710
say use of source you know as we saw

1071
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:13,130
with you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a juice shop we saw</font>

1072
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:14,840
that there's no using the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

1073
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,820
gleaned a lot information and help break

1074
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,860
in and so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like poking fun</font>

1075
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:22,480
and kind of understand what's going on
