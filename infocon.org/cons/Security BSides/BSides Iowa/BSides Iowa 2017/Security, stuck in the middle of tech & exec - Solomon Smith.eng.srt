down there telling stories um I'm I've

28
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a teacher for 15 years so you know</font>

29
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">full-time job and I ki have had a</font>

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">full-time job insecurity I went up and</font>

31
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,800
down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization lauer ladder we'll</font>

32
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,210
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a minute but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really I</font>

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,380
like sharing stories and again like

34
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,520
making people aware of what's going on

35
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,408
so here's kind of what we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,119
walk through again these experiences are

37
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,520
specifically to me they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be not</font>

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,170
normal to everybody else but like I said

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,720
I've had a lot of interactions with

40
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,960
executives and with very non-technical

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,360
people so I've taught lots and lots of

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,130
computer classes had one particular

43
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,260
example a guy came in and got done off

44
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,810
out of a three hour class and at the end

45
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,060
it was a computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> class he said okay</font>

46
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,269
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this thing here how do i turn</font>

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">it on so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've had a lot of experience</font>

48
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:19,590
communicating with people that have just

49
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,939
no idea to the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

50
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,260
executive level where they need certain

51
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,379
things so we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

52
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,260
journey some of those experiences some

53
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,060
keys to successful communications we'll

54
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,030
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few magic words or some</font>

55
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,620
buzz words and then we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

56
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to create that bridge how to go from an</font>

57
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,130
IT to an exact level

58
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,180
or from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an exact down to an IT level and</font>

59
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,840
then we'll have some recommendations in

60
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,310
a summary<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in the beginning way</font>

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,160
back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i started</font>

62
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,290
my IT career I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a city</font>

63
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,090
government there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only about 350 users</font>

64
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,609
so you know relatively small

65
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,930
organization in my mind I did anything

66
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,670
from desktop support network

67
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,290
administration help desk you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

68
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,440
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IT guy for the</font>

69
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,230
organization here's what that turn into

70
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,150
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> fields people on the team but</font>

71
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,929
this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a typical conversation</font>

72
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,790
somebody has something<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong with the</font>

73
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,290
internet they specifically said they'd

74
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,840
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> in or walk in person say hey</font>

75
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,760
question is why is the internet down and

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,100
our tech guys this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an actual</font>

77
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,690
response would be oh well we thought it

78
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,459
will offer network connection from the

79
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,829
ISP but actually when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the servers just</font>

80
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,590
scratched and the response from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

81
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,150
person asking questions was kind of like

82
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,540
what what'd you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

83
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:34,300
get that so another example anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

84
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,730
when these before user my computer just

85
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,310
stopped<font color="#E5E5E5"> working and now it's blue what</font>

86
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:42,160
the heck is going on here our IT guy oh

87
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,390
you have a bsod try restarting it that

88
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well just image it and</font>

89
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:49,119
rebuild it again the user was like cool

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,970
I don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it what what exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is BS</font>

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,640
what I don't understand so things that

92
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:57,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">came out of that particular you know</font>

93
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,369
years of experience was keeping it

94
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:02,590
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> um a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example of this and</font>

95
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,370
this was many many years ago to set up

96
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:09,070
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> user profiles it was back in the</font>

97
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,540
windows 98 days and NT we had to

98
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually set up the profile so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we had</font>

99
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,470
people's passwords we logged into them

100
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,930
so basically they would go<font color="#CCCCCC"> home at one</font>

101
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,220
night it would look one way brand new

102
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,470
machine brand new build brand new

103
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,090
profile they come in the next day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

104
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,890
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly the same because we had</font>

105
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,359
built it logged in as them made sure

106
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,010
everything work to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I counter</font>

107
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,440
everything we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it so simple</font>

108
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,610
that it was repetitive and easy and

109
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's going to be a theme through this</font>

110
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,110
is keeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that simple um the other</font>

111
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,510
thing found out really quickly is that

112
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,760
you guys I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody knows not</font>

113
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,830
every quote unquote user is created

114
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,880
equal they all have different needs they

115
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,130
all different

116
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,540
municate different questions so you know

117
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,670
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a that was the theme and that</font>

118
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,670
continued to be a theme throughout my

119
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,260
career for sure the other key here that

120
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I learned from that to experience</font>

121
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:59,200
was listen and understand what that user

122
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:02,830
problem was but then also reiterate back

123
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,640
to them in their terms but also using

124
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:09,010
some technical specifics meaning you

125
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,650
know if they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem instead of</font>

126
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying it's a bsod explain maybe what</font>

127
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:17,260
that actually is and more their layman's

128
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,490
terms and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then use when analogies you</font>

129
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,500
know I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> some examples of knowledge</font>

130
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:25,840
is in here so the more stories you can

131
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:29,050
tell the more analogies people get it so

132
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,270
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast forward I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> noticed that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

133
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,770
Nick had some you know monkey in his

134
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,320
slide so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a couple monkeys in my</font>

135
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,109
fly but I went into<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tiata I was an</font>

136
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,360
internal auditor got a fancy<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

137
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,000
badge and this is what came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> about I</font>

138
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,580
would go and I would work with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT</font>

139
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,270
technical people whether it be sir

Edmunds network admins fire Weidman's

141

are there satisfactory procedures for

146
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,120
reissuing passwords to users who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

147
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,890
forgotten there's what's satisfactory

148
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,040
real mean and procedures what's the

149
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,840
documentation soon as an auditor i would

150
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,940
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to give me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

151
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,520
give me your responses tell me verbally

152
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,290
which is cool most people pass that

153
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,090
audit test of<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to explain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

154
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,490
it's done what see that supporting

155
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:26,440
evidence of this is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's documented</font>

156
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:28,210
making sure it's the same so things

157
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,800
started start clicking in the IT audit

158
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,419
world for me and I started realizing

159
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,470
that just getting a response as a yes no

160
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,750
getting just a little bit of information

161
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,160
of oh yeah we do that here's how we do

162
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:42,880
it or if they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> went into a real</font>

163
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,920
technical speak around how they did it I

164
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,450
would have to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and figure</font>

165
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,860
out well how does that actually fit in

166
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,130
the bigger picture what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

167
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,020
actually mean what you just said give<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

168
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,300
some more<font color="#CCCCCC"> evidence so you say you change</font>

169
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,870
this port on the firewall okay that's

170
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,640
cool

171
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,690
on that school your documentation says

172
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,880
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually show me how you</font>

173
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,219
changed it give me that true picture of

174
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,560
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I needed to</font>

175
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,480
understand from an audit perspective why

176
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,460
it was like that why do you have certain

177
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,320
controls while you not have certain

178
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,049
controls why is this control better than

179
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,909
that control so that was kind of just a

180
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,290
very eye-opening experience of getting

181
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,330
that evidence and getting that

182
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,270
additional set of information again is

183
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:25,750
it built the awareness around getting

184
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,490
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> information the other kind of flip</font>

185
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,630
side of this that i found that was

186
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,210
challenging that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a lot of</font>

187
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,969
history that the previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

188
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,380
department we go in do an audit and they

189
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,210
would leave and they would go back the

190
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,159
next time do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit again and those</font>

191
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,840
people won't give any information

192
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,890
because what was happening was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IG</font>

193
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,390
otters would reported up the

194
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,039
organization all of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden there was a</font>

195
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,719
finding that that group wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

196
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,980
what they're supposed to and now those

197
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,320
people I'd well I gotta tell you

198
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,770
anything because you just you just you

199
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,510
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> tore me apart last time so keeping</font>

200
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that trust with the individual from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

201
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:00,159
IT auditor perspective I utilize my

202
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,469
technical background a lot in that

203
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular position I remember one</font>

204
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:08,650
specific example that I had to audit a

205
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,570
firewall and this guy that ran the

206
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,669
firewall had a very strong history of

207
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,010
just going through auditors left and

208
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,630
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would ask questions</font>

209
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,520
and they would either take his word for

210
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,130
it or they'd ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> really silly questions</font>

211
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,960
that you know they shouldn't been asking

212
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,969
or they would go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technical track</font>

213
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,229
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you won't be understand so what I</font>

214
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">did to prepare for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy that</font>

215
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:31,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">firewall I man was i read up i read the</font>

216
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:34,030
entire book on whatever that firewall

217
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,799
was looked up controls on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked what</font>

218
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,569
other people are did and really

219
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,729
understood what that far was all about

220
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,410
so when I went in to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him he was</font>

221
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,539
like how great newbie I'm going to burn

222
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:45,250
through this guy too we got into some

223
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,990
pretty deep technical conversations and

224
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,880
at the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it got the end of it</font>

225
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,740
is a hey you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually the</font>

226
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,080
best audit he revealed information that

227
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,790
I didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for because he trusted</font>

228
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,560
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the IC experience and then</font>

229
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,790
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to him about ok well</font>

230
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,099
here's what I'm thinking the findings

231
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,390
are does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really fit I had that</font>

232
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,880
trust with<font color="#E5E5E5"> him he's like yeah that's</font>

233
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,080
totally legit I'll fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tomorrow or</font>

234
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,790
I'll fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the next week or I</font>

235
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,720
can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because of this but you know</font>

236
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,069
we had that

237
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,750
lationship because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understood what he</font>

238
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:12,939
was saying he was then relating it back

239
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,040
to me once I had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> full picture then i</font>

240
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:17,829
can raise really up the chain of command

241
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,750
and have the appropriate audit finding

242
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:21,339
as opposed to just you know you didn't

243
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,069
do the password policy or either do this

244
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:26,620
documentation so again just reiterating

245
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:28,540
getting the whole full story and asking

246
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,050
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> more details asking the why is</font>

247
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,790
really really important so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind</font>

248
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,170
of looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at from an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IC our prospective</font>

249
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,389
down to the person<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

250
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,639
technical guy then on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flip side</font>

251
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:42,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">arranged issues because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would take</font>

252
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:45,370
these executive reports and report up to

253
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,009
sea level<font color="#E5E5E5"> people of what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> findings</font>

254
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,990
were and you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tell a CEO hey</font>

255
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:53,110
we've got a port open on this firewall

256
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,360
and it's bad they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that at all</font>

257
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,310
what you had to do or what I was

258
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,500
successful with was putting it all in

259
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,878
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of risk lots of conversations with</font>

260
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,339
management need to come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to risk</font>

261
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,139
because management executive management

262
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:07,600
understand risk they understand

263
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:09,699
financial risk they understand insurance

264
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,339
risk they get risk they get business

265
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:15,069
risk and so putting security in that

266
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:18,699
world of risk was really important so I

267
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:20,110
would define what is the likelihood well

268
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:22,449
when is this going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually happen</font>

269
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,819
and not say the likelihoods red or the

270
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:27,599
likelihood is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> three the likelihood is</font>

271
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:30,250
the translation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this will happen</font>

272
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,230
within the next six months based on

273
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,689
industry standards based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence</font>

274
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,610
based on whatever that is this will

275
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:38,230
happen within the next year<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you know</font>

276
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,240
what this really probably will happen to

277
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,259
move you know any<font color="#E5E5E5"> time the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next ten</font>

278
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,360
years I probably wouldn't worry about

279
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:45,420
that so that's kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> likelihood of</font>

280
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,379
it and then the impact piece of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

281
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,569
okay we know what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to happen in</font>

282
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:51,309
six months what's that really me is that

283
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:53,319
going to shut business out entirely is

284
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:55,360
that some one person going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be upset</font>

285
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,550
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know what is the true impact</font>

286
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,019
of this risk and so lots of

287
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,359
conversations I have with management

288
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:03,160
would all come back to this table

289
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,559
management love colors so it's easy for

290
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,829
them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the color and say oh Red</font>

291
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:10,600
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> green good ok but then explain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

292
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:13,180
them what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that red and green actually</font>

293
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,290
means from likelihood an impact next

294
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,319
question that management would always

295
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,959
talk or

296
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if it's red how much is actually</font>

297
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:23,240
gonna cost to go to that orangish color

298
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,530
or go<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to a yellow or you know well</font>

299
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,030
we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go to a green on this</font>

300
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,670
that's the very first question<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

301
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:30,980
would ask beyond anything other details

302
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,349
and then beyond that they want to know

303
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,000
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if it's going to have some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

304
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,820
million dollars to go from red to a

305
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,490
yellow how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be</font>

306
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,530
involved how much time<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it going to</font>

307
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:46,160
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> what L is that going to include is</font>

308
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:49,370
it really worth it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out of that</font>

309
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,079
again another monkey coming in got me

310
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,200
thinking quite a bit more you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

311
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I chaotic job there was a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

312
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,100
communication challenges in that that

313
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,650
really set me in the middle of reporting

314
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,610
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the executive level and also</font>

315
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,140
reporting down from a technical level

316
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,980
and being able translate between the two

317
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:09,500
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it posed a lot of questions</font>

318
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,570
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do I do this effectively one of</font>

319
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,580
the big gaps there was terminology

320
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,710
differences even from the technical side

321
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,440
it's for sure from the executive site

322
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:21,620
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you talked about a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a box</font>

323
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,290
or a hardware or a hard drive or a

324
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,390
computer you know the executive is just

325
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,069
like that thing over there I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

326
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,470
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what it does i</font>

327
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,390
just know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's kind of bad so the</font>

328
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,250
terminology was just huge differences

329
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,890
sometimes that took a little bit of

330
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Education that no mr. executive that's a</font>

331
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,800
router not a firewall or that's a switch

332
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:44,590
not a hub or whatever that might then

333
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,780
the other thing that was a challenge was

334
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,250
and all comes this little later is going

335
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,079
to right amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of detail for that</font>

336
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,020
executive I learn the hard lessons early

337
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,910
on that have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really long report and</font>

338
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,730
all its great information and gave the

339
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,230
specifics the executive would lose

340
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,450
attention really quickly because they

341
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,560
would get<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost in all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details they</font>

342
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,120
would also get frustrated because

343
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,300
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what really is the problem</font>

344
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">I need like one box or I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one page</font>

345
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,430
that really says all that 30 pages in

346
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,900
why I need it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be brief I need to I've</font>

347
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,280
got five minutes earners and what the

348
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,720
heck you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to say and then I get</font>

349
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,000
a move on so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

350
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,440
frustration both on their part because

351
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,580
they understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was setting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

352
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,570
from my part because I wasn't

353
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:28,520
communicating it correctly so that kind

354
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,560
of led into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> start up some new magic</font>

355
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,090
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about magic words in a minute</font>

356
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:38,689
but you know on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left hand side here</font>

357
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:40,640
we have on my left you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IT more</font>

358
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,590
traditional terms right hand you have

359
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,870
more kind of traditional executive terms

360
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:47,540
and you can see there's not a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

361
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,400
of overlap between the two so trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

362
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,079
find what those specific ones are is

363
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:55,370
challenging so we'll come back to that

364
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,710
in a few minutes here so I left an<font color="#CCCCCC"> icy</font>

365
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,890
audit job went in to get kind of a true

366
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:03,680
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> manager job when I got into</font>

367
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,689
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the same things came</font>

368
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,459
back from audit we talked a lot about

369
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,440
risk we talked about governance we

370
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,970
talked about compliance there were

371
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,820
specific standards that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to</font>

372
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:15,290
understand so it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more you had</font>

373
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,260
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and you have you couldn't do</font>

374
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">this I was responsible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for security</font>

375
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,580
training so<font color="#CCCCCC"> again going back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to making</font>

376
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,230
sure what that message is is consumable

377
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,420
I mean how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have gone to her</font>

378
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,430
security training and at the end the

379
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,780
people like what did I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch I</font>

380
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,339
don't I didn't get any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how do</font>

381
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you people actually retain it and not</font>

382
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,790
just for a test right after the training

383
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,980
but six months<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the road you ask</font>

384
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:39,079
them hey what's a threat most time

385
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,550
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it so that's</font>

386
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,190
cute training piece was was a piece of

387
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:46,130
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a huge piece of this job is as</font>

388
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,920
my as a security manager was getting

389
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:52,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">rfps getting requests for proposals in</font>

390
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,430
and the full proposal was sometimes 300

391
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,160
pages long the specific section on

392
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,910
security was only about 33 pages long

393
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,579
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is traditionally anywhere from</font>

394
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:06,740
minimum of 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 20 up to like 200</font>

395
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,290
questions about security and it's not

396
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">just an opening question of hey do you</font>

397
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,689
have a firewall it's okay what ports do

398
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,130
you allow on the firewall and what audit

399
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,750
you know criteria do you use and what

400
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,850
standards do you follow and where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

401
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,680
evidence and you know answering these

402
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,260
our peer responses was a huge huge

403
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,239
challenge in this particular role so

404
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,280
understanding what the needs were and

405
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,540
then being able to answer it correctly

406
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:36,110
again go back to that translation so

407
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:41,750
part of that and and part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

408
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that was communicating the IT team Ed</font>

409
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,650
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Beyond IT</font>

410
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:48,100
and also including a superior<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge</font>

411
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:50,290
terminology so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> T terminology is one</font>

412
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,150
thing security terminology is even yet

413
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:55,719
another one and so having to add that

414
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:58,150
layer of complexity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to translate what a</font>

415
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,360
security threat would be what a

416
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:03,220
vulnerability was again what risk is to

417
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,690
both people inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization of</font>

418
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization down the organization</font>

419
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start adding</font>

420
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:13,449
more complexity into it those external

421
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:15,940
resources audit again working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with audit</font>

422
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,680
quite a bit more telling the story in

423
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of they could that they could</font>

424
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,520
understand the thing that was

425
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,250
challenging with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

426
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,470
position was I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> from an audit</font>

427
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,630
position<font color="#CCCCCC"> where basically as an auditor I</font>

428
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,730
could tell people hey you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

429
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:33,760
password policy that says it has to be

430
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:36,040
25 characters and them as the oddity

431
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,180
didn't really get much choice in it well

432
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,189
they like it or not a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font>

433
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,349
they're like oh fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they're doing</font>

434
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,600
this one was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit different in</font>

435
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,790
that it was sometimes a checkbox for

436
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,650
compliance because we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font>

437
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,900
versus we really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the right</font>

438
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,250
thing and the right thing sometimes was

439
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,650
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more effort a lot more time lot</font>

440
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,600
more money so that was a chance to

441
00:16:53,650 --> 00:17:00,939
explain why we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it one way</font>

442
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:03,910
versus another this was a interesting

443
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:06,690
little hiatus ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went off for a</font>

444
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,920
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half and got out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

445
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:11,199
security world out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outlawed it</font>

446
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,720
world which I knew and was very smooth

447
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,880
and very good at to go and being an HR

448
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,329
executive at a row a pretty large

449
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,520
company you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well how did that</font>

450
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,190
transition happen well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

451
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,859
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in fact that a new technology I</font>

452
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,540
knew the executives they knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

453
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:30,310
could explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him what exactly was</font>

454
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,700
going on and there was a huge huge

455
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:37,570
problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the HR technology that was</font>

456
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,790
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there my role in this job was to go</font>

457
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,490
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find every piece of HR</font>

458
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,649
technology and organization and again

459
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,900
this was a very large company there was

460
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,610
like three thousand HR related

461
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,200
technologies out there ranging from

462
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:53,199
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracks on a spreadsheet to we've</font>

463
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,820
got a very complex system this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

464
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,389
chart on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right-hand side kind</font>

465
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,158
of shows

466
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:58,928
just some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system that company</font>

467
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,440
probably had<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about every single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

468
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:04,899
of these and so my role was to do a few

469
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,629
things the first one was figure out what

470
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:09,399
all those systems work and then once I

471
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:11,949
figure out what those systems were what

472
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:13,869
they actually did and then I'd have to

473
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,109
summarize that to be able to say we've

474
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:19,619
got 13 recruiting systems here's what

475
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:22,539
they all do here's how much they cost

476
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:24,339
here's our Lee here's the ROI which will

477
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:25,779
come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the river return on</font>

478
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:28,539
investment so we're paying a million

479
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:30,279
dollars to buy them or use them but

480
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:31,179
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only getting two hundred two</font>

481
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,429
hundred thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars worth of</font>

482
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:36,459
actually return on it based on you know

483
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:38,529
metrics then I'd have to figure out

484
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:41,440
those 13 recruiting systems and we

485
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:42,909
consolidate down to one can we can sell

486
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in on 22 well they work together</font>

487
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:47,559
what's the best debris so this was like

488
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:52,989
a huge huge activity to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to take</font>

489
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:54,700
IT an executive requirements and save

490
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:55,749
money make it more efficient and

491
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,209
actually at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day make it</font>

492
00:18:55,749 --> 00:19:00,339
better so<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the time they took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it at</font>

493
00:18:58,209 --> 00:19:02,169
that okay fine it's it's interesting at

494
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,479
when I got done<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I left that</font>

495
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:05,739
position of like what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that</font>

496
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:06,789
looking back now and reflecting it was

497
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:09,039
actually a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good experience</font>

498
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:10,690
because again it was similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

499
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:17,109
audit<font color="#E5E5E5"> role and you had to translate up</font>

500
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:18,070
and down the organization so and here

501
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:20,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some of the lessons when I learned</font>

502
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:23,289
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular experience HR</font>

503
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:25,570
doesn't understand technology very well

504
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:27,669
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a pretty pretty good</font>

505
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,499
blanket statement next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one many</font>

506
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:31,929
high-level executives also<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

507
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:34,919
understand technology very well because

508
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:37,989
I really had to test my reporting and

509
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:41,409
reporting concise and details and get to

510
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:43,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">the point i also really learned the</font>

511
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:47,769
importance of explaining actual costs

512
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:49,389
and the return on investment so are we

513
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:51,820
really getting what we're paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> for or</font>

514
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:54,399
is this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was free actually give</font>

515
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,200
us the best benefit and then they're

516
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:58,329
really the probably most challenging

517
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,639
piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular role was how do</font>

518
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:03,389
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3,000 systems fit together in</font>

519
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:05,859
the bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture why is this system</font>

520
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:07,238
recruiting and this one is onboarding

521
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:08,439
and what's the difference and why do we

522
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">have both and why is it</font>

523
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,390
this location<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus allocation so being</font>

524
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:17,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to tell that in a big picture was</font>

525
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:20,140
really really challenging so I left HR

526
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,550
management executive level and when it's

527
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">more the security privacy officer</font>

528
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:26,260
position so on from a manager to an

529
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:30,010
officer level which again<font color="#CCCCCC"> gained more</font>

530
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:32,290
responsibilities we see some some of the

531
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,850
mind map here that is an example of<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

532
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:37,149
all the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that sisa would</font>

533
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,919
do and that kind of passwords to my

534
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">current role and really what I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

535
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,810
now with with the startup company is

536
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,030
demonstrating how it's supposed to be

537
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:48,190
done using our company as a showcase to

538
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,600
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's a way to do it and</font>

539
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a way to do it right so we're</font>

540
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,409
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you the right way to doing</font>

541
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,390
that takes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of work and then being</font>

542
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,580
able to explain why we did this

543
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,050
particular firewall versus that firewall

544
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,120
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we open this pork well we don't</font>

545
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,620
look at this port while we have this for

546
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,510
identity access management but we don't

547
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,750
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so having all these things in</font>

548
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,670
place again and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just knowing it</font>

549
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,410
for our organizations but to be able to

550
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,030
tell customers about it and have them

551
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,220
buy into it and have them understand it

552
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,050
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then also have them say yeah that</font>

553
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,120
makes sense and you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should do</font>

554
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,129
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so again this whole</font>

555
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,699
translation piece comes back comes back

556
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:26,170
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and over every client has a</font>

557
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,960
different problem they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

558
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:31,120
solve and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool</font>

559
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,310
that's the solution a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times it's</font>

560
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,649
how you implement it what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

561
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:38,980
implement tool agnostic they still got

562
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:42,160
the same problem also<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out from this</font>

563
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:45,280
particular role is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to</font>

564
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,110
fully explain something and then support

565
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,450
why you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it one way as opposed</font>

566
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,580
to we get many<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients that say hey I</font>

567
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">just need to be HIPAA compliant whatever</font>

568
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,600
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get those checkboxes done that's all</font>

569
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,430
I want to do I don't want to do

570
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,050
whatever's best practice I don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

571
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,910
I have a you know my front door is

572
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,580
unlocked as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can say I'm HIPAA</font>

573
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,050
compliant that's all I need and so

574
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,300
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard conversation to say</font>

575
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,659
well you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to put that lock on</font>

576
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,860
the front door and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is why I'm</font>

577
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,300
helping them understand risk management

578
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,709
the theme of risk management keeps

579
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,500
coming in over and over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

580
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,460
and then expanding expressed on de

581
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:23,720
question of why and then again

582
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:25,760
I piece so here's what all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those stories</font>

583
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,649
kind of come together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is kind</font>

584
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,929
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recommendations or where it fit</font>

585
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:32,479
so the keys to successful communications

586
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:34,309
telling a story having that good story

587
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,039
to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> using analogies and examples</font>

588
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:39,649
which will go through finding out what

589
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,620
words are triggers for both<font color="#E5E5E5"> sides of the</font>

590
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:44,870
coin so knowing what word will then

591
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,969
spark an interest in either an IT person

592
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,889
or an executive and then finally

593
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">creating that bridge putting yourself in</font>

594
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,669
their shoes what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> they really need to</font>

595
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,289
know what do they not need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know where</font>

596
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:56,149
are you just the expert and if you can

597
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,250
prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your expert then they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

598
00:22:56,149 --> 00:23:00,049
just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I get it I'm listening to</font>

599
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">you you're the expert I'll do what you</font>

600
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:06,408
say so here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of telling a</font>

601
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:09,949
story walking<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this so this is an</font>

602
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:11,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of a bank and two factor</font>

603
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,210
authentication so this was part of one

604
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,710
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trainings on that we had done and</font>

605
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:19,039
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was explaining the difference between</font>

606
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:21,110
a threat the Vanar ability to threat the

607
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,549
incident and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual breach so you</font>

608
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,370
have an online checking account weak

609
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:28,129
password that's a vulnerability a threat

610
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,229
hacker could use a tool to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

611
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,370
password that might be a threat you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

612
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,620
some controls in place to hopefully

613
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,350
would stop that that's where your two

614
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,000
factor authentication would come in if

615
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:40,549
it doesn't stop it you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep that</font>

616
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,190
weak password the incident is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

617
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:44,809
able to bypass those controls view

618
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,390
account data compromise confidentiality

619
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:50,690
that's your incident and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the</font>

620
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:52,159
breach is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would steal it data take</font>

621
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,919
the money whereas<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may be so using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

622
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,779
analogy of a checking account has people

623
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:59,899
understanding as opposed to saying well

624
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:02,000
a security vulnerability is a CSS score

625
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:03,799
of this and it needs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this in a</font>

626
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,260
nice to this and the threat is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some</font>

627
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,700
bad guy might do this normal users

628
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,370
aren't going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for the most</font>

629
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,690
part they'll understand breach probably

630
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:13,370
they'll say oh I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that breach</font>

631
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:17,720
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paper but they won't know they're</font>

632
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:20,629
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> a breach and an incident another</font>

633
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">example explaining surgeons knowledge</font>

634
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:25,340
service so try explaining that to

635
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:27,889
somebody who doesn't know anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

636
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,209
computers it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenged the analogy</font>

637
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:30,269
that I've used<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the past is think</font>

638
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">about going on the inner</font>

639
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:35,429
everybody's done it right you know how

640
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:37,499
it works except this normal is good

641
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:39,690
except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this day whatever reason the</font>

642
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:41,489
traffic on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your state is completely</font>

643
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,259
jammed don't know what's going on just

644
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:46,080
know it's completely jammed if you play

645
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I can I can envision that nobody</font>

646
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get on nobody can get off all right</font>

647
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:54,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm sitting in traffic is jammed I</font>

648
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:56,009
understand that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your denial of service</font>

649
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:56,969
means you can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything else it's</font>

650
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:58,769
completely locked everything up

651
00:24:56,969 --> 00:25:00,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually it will clear out hopefully</font>

652
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:02,459
and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the air state now oh</font>

653
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:03,570
okay I get that obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta fill in</font>

654
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,489
the holes a little bit more there but

655
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,989
the analogy they will get they'll

656
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:08,369
understand getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the interstate as</font>

657
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:09,899
opposed to you tell them the technical

658
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:12,689
components of it and this is how it

659
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:14,668
actually works you overflow with packets

660
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:19,589
and you this news no whoa what what's a

661
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:22,049
packet I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it so magic words</font>

662
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:24,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">buzz words they might hear these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thrown</font>

663
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">around the office may be here executives</font>

664
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:28,919
reports with this but you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

665
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:32,489
most executive on with you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside</font>

666
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,229
the box it's the early mean hit you hit

667
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:36,539
the nail ahead on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one can you</font>

668
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:38,969
please go on a deeper dive a game

669
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:40,709
changer this is a I heard this a lot

670
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:42,629
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> boil the ocean don't try to do</font>

671
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:46,320
everything but yet we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that quick</font>

672
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:47,519
win ok hit that low hanging fruit that's

673
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,658
a return on investment again so these

674
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some buzz words that you might hear</font>

675
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:54,320
throwing around specific security

676
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:57,958
<font color="#CCCCCC">buzzwords confidentiality availability</font>

677
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,759
integrity the CIA a lot of the

678
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:00,690
executives won't really get that you

679
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,599
know it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than we talked about</font>

680
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:05,940
security risk that is one where actually

681
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,339
it is pretty committee um pretty

682
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,559
effective across both sides the specific

683
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:13,200
technologies the tools you go into a

684
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,729
specific tool or specific technology

685
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,440
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that and then</font>

686
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:20,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">through in their budget as a security</font>

687
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,619
magic word so if you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get your</font>

688
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:25,079
point across and your budget in there or

689
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:27,559
looking for budget or me budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

690
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:29,849
seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that comes up quite a bit</font>

691
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:31,799
magic words for<font color="#E5E5E5"> executives so a little</font>

692
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:33,629
bit different flavor they want anything

693
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:35,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">like strategy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where's it's fitting the</font>

694
00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:37,899
overall strategy how does it fit<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

695
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:40,570
our two year plan our three year planner

696
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:44,320
six months where's the strategy what's

697
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:45,939
the risk what's the cost is this going

698
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,590
to be profitable<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a great</font>

699
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,120
conversation with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an executive trainers</font>

700
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:55,179
trying to have them understand that

701
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:56,709
putting in a IDs as profitable they

702
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,970
don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> they understand because it</font>

703
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,010
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them money they can't see a</font>

704
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,540
check coming in so if you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the</font>

705
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">other side say well this is how it's</font>

706
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,540
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decrease the risk they'll say</font>

707
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,840
well how much okay if it didn't make us

708
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:09,700
money how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it safe well it</font>

709
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,870
didn't do that either so what's that

710
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">really looked like from a cost</font>

711
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,889
perspective you have to you have to you

712
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:18,100
know play around with what those needs

713
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,750
are a little bit from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a property listing</font>

714
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,610
point so schedule<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeline that's</font>

715
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:24,250
another question<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will ask is well</font>

716
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:27,699
how long is it going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at the</font>

717
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:30,880
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day we put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that new idea IPS</font>

718
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:33,280
in what are the deliverables what is

719
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,820
actually in the day what's needed and

720
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,560
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last question is a lot of times</font>

721
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,290
from an executive side well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we do</font>

722
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,470
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I did how does it impact</font>

723
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:46,000
that end customer that end user is it

724
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,380
going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it slower for them faster</font>

725
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">than for them so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to call me</font>

726
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,280
and complain about it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what is</font>

727
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,260
what's the impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that end customer</font>

728
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,060
so knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these are kind of the</font>

729
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,700
triggers<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that executive is important</font>

730

to know so that you handle that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I really like this one that you have</font>

your nice fancy bow tie bits only and

735
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,750
that cables but you know understanding

of the keys to bridging these gaps most

739
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,490
executives don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to understand the</font>

bits and the bite but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you show that</font>

00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:24,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is how it fits into the bigger</font>

00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,830
picture this is how it fits into the

00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:29,560
strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will help them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

744
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:32,980
why it's important how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it relates to</font>

00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">other technologies so we have an IDs and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of maybe understand what that</font>

747
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:39,490
means we also have dlp or maybe we have

748
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,919
a firewall that does this but we have a

749

solar device that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> something similar</font>

750
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:47,680
and then asking the right questions to

751
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:49,190
get the right answers if you have that

752
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,620
Q&A section with the

753

with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> executive making sure that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ask you have the right answer from the</font>

technology perspective but also an

executive start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> an headline very</font>

762
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,010
first thing is throw it through a

headline out there this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we're</font>

767
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:28,100
make it very short and to the point

768
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,620
bring in the strategy connection you

769
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">know as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said before our strategy is to</font>

771
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,680
relates to it if you can't make that

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,270
strategy connection with with what

773
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,060
you're trying to accomplish or whatever

774
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:42,620
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> t is where that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is or how</font>

775
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,540
you can't get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> strategy because</font>

776
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,820
you have a prom a nightie<font color="#CCCCCC"> you probably</font>

777
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,980
lose that executive the budget in the

<font color="#CCCCCC">costs they were always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asked about</font>

779

00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">indoor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't understand what they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really going to cost five dollars what</font>

00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,550
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers schedule and then</font>

786
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:06,620
really focus on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future as opposed to</font>

787
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:08,960
the past many times<font color="#CCCCCC"> the executives don't</font>

788
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,419
want to hear we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had three years of</font>

this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we just need to fix it</font>

790
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:17,060
now I know if you say well in the next

791
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,550
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years we're going to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

ABC and D<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we do this that's</font>

00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward thinking that provides more</font>

794

emphasis to your solution or what you're

795
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,380
trying to accomplish there so the

796
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:32,510
executives will respond much much better

797
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:34,340
to those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay going a little bit</font>

798
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,770
further<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so don't spend too much</font>

799
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,649
time on the details but hasn't prepared

800
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:42,370
for the questions brevity is very

801
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:45,830
important here get right to the point

802
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:47,270
make sure you get enough information

803
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:50,590
that executives so they know exactly

804
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:53,150
what they need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a decision it</font>

805
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,530
seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like time after time when you have</font>

806
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:57,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have multiple conversations or the</font>

807
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:59,060
same thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get as much success</font>

808
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,740
as opposed to if you give them enough

809
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,639
information right off the bat do you'll

810
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,139
make a decision

811
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:05,208
they can then<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and get it back to</font>

812
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:07,939
you quickly or get back to you right<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

813
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:09,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">the spot there think like an executive</font>

814
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,229
think okay if I'm running this company

815
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,269
what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> do i need to hear what's</font>

816
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:16,309
important I know the bits and bytes are

817
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:17,839
important but what is some an executive

818
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:19,609
perspective if they've got a hundred

819
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:20,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">things to think about what's really</font>

820
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:23,658
important about this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue</font>

821
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:25,039
and then communicate like an executive

822
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:28,279
you know look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what kind of</font>

823
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:34,820
terminology look at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of styles</font>

824
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:36,289
they use so<font color="#E5E5E5"> these will be for all my</font>

825
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,239
executives in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room so let's give me</font>

826
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:39,979
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little different but you know</font>

827
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:41,779
I also put the expectation on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

828
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:43,219
executive you can't always blame IT for

00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:45,950
bringing the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> Williams security</font>

00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:47,719
for being the problem from an executive

832
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:52,399
pass out and say look when you meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

833
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:53,539
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how much time you have you</font>

834
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,458
have five minutes to get your point

<font color="#E5E5E5">across the persons are preparing for two</font>

840
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:07,369
a text I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> several executives I've</font>

841
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:09,408
worked with that you would send them an

842
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:11,689
email nothing you'd send them a text you

843
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:13,309
get respond like that so it's knowing

844
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,909
what that person needs from a

845
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:18,799
communication style as for examples are

846
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:20,419
analogy<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an executive and</font>

847
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,729
you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand from a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't get what you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying give me a</font>

851
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,019
research i got these books up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

852
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:32,029
as example that you know from an

00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:33,919
executive side you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> take some</font>

854
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:35,089
ownership because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> t is certainly and</font>

00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:42,289
really means it doesn't mean you have to

858
00:32:39,229 --> 00:32:43,399
configure you know a specific system but

859
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:46,700

of what I tia is what security<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

877
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,590

and you know provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> some examples get</font>

886
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,670
some of those lessons learned out there

887
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,740
ask for analogies and ask for feedback

888
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:46,180
so as an entry<font color="#E5E5E5"> level there's some things</font>

that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do right now even even if you</font>

893
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,530
chain more of a mid-level this is the

894
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">point where you should hopefully start</font>

895
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:01,389
understanding the business strategy

896
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,560
being able to explain that strategy

897
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,660

902
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:17,379
join a peer mentoring group and this

903
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">really is around if you are the help</font>

904
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:21,429
desk guy start meeting and networking

905
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,840
with the networking guys with the

906
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:24,970
development guys you know cross

907
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,500
laterally at your level get that

908
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:28,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship and have them understand</font>

909
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,219
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do and what they do also so you</font>

910
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,380
get that relationship you get an

911
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:34,659
understanding of what everybody's doing

912
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:38,320
and then also build relationships with

913
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:41,678
finance HR audit legal etc so go beyond

914
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,700
just IT<font color="#E5E5E5"> has those connections and all</font>

915
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,960
the other different departments of the

916
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:49,299
organization big enough to have those um

917
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,740
an executive level so looking from the

918
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,060
top down these are things that I would

919
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:53,949
give recognition is from an executive

920
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,350
level they should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing get educated</font>

921
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">take classes an IT take classes in</font>

922
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:01,180
security and privacy meet with<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile</font>

923
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,919
multiple layers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> security not just</font>

924
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,779
management I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this far out and then</font>

925
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,940
you know your sea level person is just

926
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:10,750
meeting with your director of IT or your

927
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:13,660
director of X particular area not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

928
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:16,330
often does the CEO go down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

929
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">the programmer and I think that's kind</font>

930
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,808
of a

931
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:21,190
mess you know I know they're busy but

932
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:23,950
understand really what every person I

933
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:26,109
organization as much as possible what

934
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,848
they contribute you get that kind of

935
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:29,469
involvement and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to</font>

936
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:30,670
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that look you're not just a</font>

937
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:34,089
number you're actually here for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a reason</font>

938
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:36,039
that's really important a good

939
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:39,219
recommendation I have for an executive

940
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:40,989
is get involved with an incident from a

941
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:44,460
security site and get involved with

942
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:46,960
insurance file not just when it happens

943
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,299
not just when you get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level</font>

944
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,739
report that oh we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had a we just had</font>

945
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:52,509
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little blip yesterday and the</font>

946
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:54,039
executives are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no big deal but</font>

947
00:35:52,509 --> 00:35:57,160
actually go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that process from</font>

948
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:59,710
beginning to end nothing frustrates me

949
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,029
more than when something comes out of

950
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,440
the blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you're not sure what</font>

951
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:04,569
happened beforehand you think that's

952
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,069
just easy if they're involved with the

953
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:07,869
instant response process so slow getting

954
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:09,308
appreciation of well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

955
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:11,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">really complicated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually there's a</font>

956
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:12,759
lot of pieces in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here ok I understand</font>

957
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:15,939
that you did forensics work I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

958
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:18,549
now um last thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an executive-level</font>

executives and like oh security you know

965
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:35,529
that's like that home depot thing that's

966
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:37,238
like anthem and that won't happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

967
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:38,710
and you know there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

968
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:40,960
people out there that actually can do

969

<font color="#E5E5E5">this right it's like no you need to go</font>

973
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,059
stone to this but when you go there get

974
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:51,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">your eyes open to the capabilities of</font>

975
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:53,079
this community it's amazing it's scary

976
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,579
amazing so that would be my executive

977
00:36:53,079 --> 00:37:00,069
level of recommendations in summary

978
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:03,549
wrapping things<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you know tell stories</font>

979
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:05,619
use example of analogies they can speak

980
00:37:03,549 --> 00:37:07,359
alike put yourself in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other person's</font>

981
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:09,489
shoes well you're an executive looking

982
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,859
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> at IT or IT looking up at an</font>

983
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:13,509
executive-level put yourself in their

984
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:15,880
shoes what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to know</font>

985
00:37:13,509 --> 00:37:18,339
and then if you're in a nightie looking

986
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,519
up an executive level and you think you

987
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:22,989
need to take up an hour realize that

988
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,098
executive movie won't have five<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font>

989
00:37:22,989 --> 00:37:26,769
you need to condense it down put

990
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:28,900
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their shoes really focus on</font>

991
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:30,020
delivery & style get all the details so

992
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,210
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got enough information</font>

993
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,430
most people in this field get that they

994
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:37,520
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> details folks on the overall</font>

995
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:44,660
strategy and then provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question</font>

996
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:53,480
of why the answers to why that's me I'll

997
00:37:44,660 --> 00:38:04,210
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> up for questions we will challenge</font>

998
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:04,210
with this area specific challenges yeah

999
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:16,690
yeah so um the questions are<font color="#E5E5E5"> our metrics</font>

1000
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:19,879
so there's there's lots of different

1001
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:21,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">metrics and maturity models out there I</font>

1002
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,640
haven't found one that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> really fell in</font>

1003
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:25,160
love with so what I do is actually

1004
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,500
create my own maturity matrix that would

1005
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,109
show this is what good is and how to

1006
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,540
measure good this is what not good is

1007
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:34,400
and how to measure good so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1008
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:36,320
they're not specific ones depending on

1009
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,300
what you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get across there's</font>

1010
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,790
you know each one has a metric but

1011
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,230
metrics is a hard one um and especially

1012
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:45,020
doing our way that's a hard one to

1013
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:47,360
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> give it this is a 3 out of a</font>

1014
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:49,550
five usually gets that out of more I

1015
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">tiata type questions of the responses</font>

1016
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:54,620
but yeah metrics is a hard one so I

1017
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:58,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have a specific you go to this</font>

1018
00:38:54,620 --> 00:39:01,660
particular website other questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

1019
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:04,630
give the recommendations

1020
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,720
that works specifically within product

1021
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:09,280
security as opposed to IT security

1022
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,470
because executives in that area would

1023
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,960
always see security<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost right</font>

1024
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:19,180
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say from the product side</font>

1025
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,549
the hook into the executive is the

1026
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:24,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">impact of the customer and and really</font>

1027
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:26,049
showing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would suppose more</font>

1028
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:29,038
specifics on products might even better

1029
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:31,329
understand but you know if you explain

1030
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,270
from a customer perspective how you're

1031
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:37,270
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it easier better faster or</font>

1032
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:39,788
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually those things well sometimes</font>

1033
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:42,220
equate to you can you can charge more

1034
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:43,329
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this product because it's</font>

1035
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,009
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make it easier it's going to</font>

1036
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:47,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it faster yes Curie is a hard one</font>

1037
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:52,329
to to respond to from an executive level

1038
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:56,520
or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> support the cause an</font>

1039
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:56,520
executive from from products for sure

1040
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:00,059
others

1041
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:08,869
thing else

1042
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:11,819
I had a question sure on this one I mean

1043
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:13,619
weird situations I'm more on the vendor

1044
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:19,288
side and lift our theory they are trying

1045
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:21,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get part of the sweet the message and</font>

1046
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:23,729
what to convey this is an excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1047
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:26,189
think it clarified a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1048
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:27,959
maybe I ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be mistaking doings</font>

1049
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:30,569
being a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little overly technical with the</font>

1050
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:33,390
exact and like that but what's the best

1051
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:36,179
way to get a seat at that table how to

1052
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:38,879
initiate that conversation and get that

1053
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:41,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">get your get your time with the things</font>

1054
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">from an outside by the perspective yeah</font>

1055
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:45,209
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so kind of question is from an</font>

1056
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:47,069
outside vendor perspective how do you

1057
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,868
successfully get into that company to

1058
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:51,329
get your product in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their future service</font>

1059
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:53,939
in there um what's been successful with

1060
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:56,039
us there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple different things one</font>

1061
00:40:53,939 --> 00:40:58,408
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> its building that relationship so</font>

they trust it you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you're</font>

1063
00:40:58,409 --> 00:41:01,739
doing you're doing on behalf of them as

1064
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,199
opposed to just pushing your product

1065
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:05,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to make a buck having confidence</font>

1066
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:08,279
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your product actually will solve</font>
