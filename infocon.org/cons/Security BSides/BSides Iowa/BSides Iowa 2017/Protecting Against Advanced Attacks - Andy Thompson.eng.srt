we're finding is is the Swift network in

what happened in this particular

a typo in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bank transaction five</font>

it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be red team starting off</font>

90
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,680
where we're actually going to

91
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,240
demonstrate a golden ticket attack and

92
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,940
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it from the initial</font>

93
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,410
inception of the macro if you came to

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the previous talk where they were</font>

discussing macros this is a very simple

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">not obligated macro all the way to where</font>

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,320
we actually execute our<font color="#CCCCCC"> endgame the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

98
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,760
phase of the talk is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a blue side</font>

99
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,040
of the talk where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talk about identity</font>

100
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,019
access management best practices and how

101
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,090
any one of those individual controls

102
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,289
could have been applied<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a way that</font>

103
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,299
would have stopped the attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

104
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,220
previously demonstrated then we'll open

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,830
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to some Q&A and whatever you</font>

106
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,790
choose to do afterward is up to you so

107
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,740
this is a golden ticket attack this is a

108
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,840
whole proof of concept that I've done in

109

six minutes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would have been for</font>

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,729
absolutely terrible at typing there's a

112
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,779
couple of disclaimers before I really

113
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:51,159
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing is is that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">discovered they haven't quite identified</font>

it directly but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they assumed that this</font>

up being channeled to abuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> i F and</font>

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,979
it just didn't work in my demo so I

147
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:05,080
didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then lastly we're not</font>

148
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:07,688
dropping any zero days this isn't any

149
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,430
elite hacks or anything this is very

150
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:11,889
simple stuff all downloaded off the

151
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,569
internet and I often joke it so easy you

152
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,459
don't have to be a 400-pound hacker in

153
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:18,399
your mother's basement to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

154
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so golden ticket attack who's here</font>

155
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">familiar with the golden ticket attack</font>

156
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,860
or Kerberos<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's get a couple</font>

157

you yes come on<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here</font>

161
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,700
pretty green and my domain controller

162
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,500
here's some tickets for you in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

163
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,180
so you guys go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and read your</font>

168
00:06:52,770 --> 00:07:02,789
underscore awesome the password is very

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:07,140
good very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi file server I'm Bob I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Thika so doesn't mean that the domain</font>

172
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,760
controllers days you're good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay fine</font>

173
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:17,220
there you go that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in SS in essence</font>

174
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,560
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Kerberos exchanges the domain</font>

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,630
controller validates the credentials

176
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,150
gives the ticket<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the ticket is what</font>

177
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,469
generates access<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is what a</font>

178
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:30,210
golden ticket attack essentially is

179
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:34,320
doing here oh that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> golden ticket</font>

180
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,330
attack thank you I'll clean this up

181
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,550
later I promise thank you guys for

182
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:44,190
coming I appreciate you give them around

183
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:46,170
a round of applause thank you alright so

184
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,480
that was the golden ticket attack and

185
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,400
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the advanced target</font>

186
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,280
attack what is an advanced re attack or

187
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,070
apt it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the fact that they</font>

188
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,150
have an act bad actor or what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font>

189
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:01,170
bomb threat actor from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous talk</font>

190
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,120
embedded in your organization for a

191
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,890
significantly long period of time and to

192
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,540
the point which they know the ins and

193
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,479
outs of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network in your</font>

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure better than almost you do</font>

195
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,350
this is in direct contrast to what we've

196
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,659
seen with other<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of attacks we have</font>

197
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:18,050
the distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> denial-of-service attack</font>

198
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,460
not an AP not advance attack

199
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,050
opportunistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks such as ransomware</font>

200
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,729
where they don't care who<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are but</font>

201
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,040
they're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> being attacked not an</font>

202
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,320
advanced targeted attack we the closest

203
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,880
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see to that is the what we call</font>

204
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,220
a quick targeted attack which is those

205
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,169
gentlemen calling from Microsoft wanting

206
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,430
to help you fix your computer again

207
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,659
you're a target but it's a not a

208
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:41,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-term attack we're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now about</font>

209
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,929
the phases of an advanced<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack and</font>

210
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:45,180
what you're going to notice here this

211
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:48,630
exactly correlates to your red team

212
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,640
a apt attack and most importantly your

213
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,620
penetration testers the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font>

214
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,360
is is that penetration testers<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

215
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,279
much shorter runway where their

216
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,860
operation is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two three</font>

217
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">weeks tops these advanced actors can do</font>

218
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,750
to three years in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so but</font>

219
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,609
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spaces are still</font>

220
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same first one is starting off with</font>

221
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,690
the intern or external reconnaissance

222
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,130
learning about the organization second

223
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,230
is followed by the breach which is what

224
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,790
we'll do with the macro followed by

225
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,170
internal reconnaissance learning about

226
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,860
the network learning about the systems

227
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,849
on the network lateral movement is

228
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,950
basically pivoting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> those other</font>

229
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoints and expanding your scope of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you need to execute an in game it's a</font>

233
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,089
matter of establishing your permanency

234
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:34,620
in your network this is the domain

235
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:36,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">compromised and where the golden</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ticket</font>

236
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,450
attack comes into play and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

237
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,000
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> execution of the in game so let's</font>

238
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,040
start with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first phase of breach</font>

239
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,029
rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> external reconnaissance</font>

240
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,500
let's assume you've already done that

241
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:48,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're going to do here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

242
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,930
PowerShell Empire is craft an email

243
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,540
attachment with the macro and

244
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:56,969
demonstrate the execution of it and then

245
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:59,189
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your network so will first</font>

246
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,620
start off here again the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools we</font>

247
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:04,830
are using here are PowerShell Empire and

248
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,260
the vegetables with it this is a

249
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,540
demonstration of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> spaniard user it's a</font>

250
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,520
Windows 7 machine the standard user

251
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,189
count happens to be local admin on the

252
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,020
machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but doesn't necessarily have to</font>

253
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,089
the end user opens up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Excel macro</font>

254
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,890
are they excel documents and<font color="#CCCCCC"> macros</font>

255
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,170
executed and you'll see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> its shell</font>

256
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:25,830
is established on my command<font color="#E5E5E5"> and control</font>

257
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:28,500
back end so there it is now what we're

258
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:31,589
going to do is interact with that shell

259
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,870
and now we know it's got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> local admin</font>

260
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:37,100
rights we need to try to bypass the UAC

261
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,990
using the function called bypass UAC

262
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,660
cleverly named we're able to execute a

263
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,610
second shell with<font color="#CCCCCC"> bypass USD permissions</font>

264
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,920
meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can execute commands</font>

265
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">that require elevation without prompting</font>

266
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,689
that screen to pop up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end user's</font>

267
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,700
machine so we've gone ahead and we've

268
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're interacting with our</font>

269
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,519
newly established

270
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,769
bill and we can commence the rest of

271
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,899
this attack so again now we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

272
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:04,730
breach head into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization now</font>

273
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,560
it's a matter of moving to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next step</font>

274
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,720
the lateral movement are eternal

275
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,279
reconnaissance phase this is now where

276
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,110
we need to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the network learn</font>

277
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the people on the network and the</font>

278
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,050
people that we want to attack you want

279
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,180
to go after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people with the most</font>

280
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,490
privileged systems administrators and

281
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,709
domain admin access is really ultimately

282
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,660
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get when you're dealing</font>

283
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:25,670
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a golden ticket type of an attack</font>

284
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,160
so what we're going to do is we're going

285
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run several commands to learn a</font>

286
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,449
little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the organization</font>

287
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,759

292
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:47,050
we're going to interact back with our

gone a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> faster for me what</font>

296
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,508
we're going to do is we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font>

organization of significantly more the

308
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,089
next thing that we would want to do is

309
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,009
find out what sort of computer objects

310
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:24,500
are in play what machines can we

311
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:26,389
possibly pivot using the function

all the computer objects that are on the

319
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,709
really two machines that were of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> value</font>

00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:49,579
switch server is completely locked down

<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody has access to it file server on</font>

326
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:58,189
to be a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> different than what</font>

327
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,129
you'd see what the normal application

328
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:03,649
service so file server is an interesting

329
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:05,360
target now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run to get low</font>

330
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:07,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">Group command we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out</font>

331
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,279
who the administrators are on that

332
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,079
particular file<font color="#CCCCCC"> server so we define the</font>

333
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,180
file server name is the server name<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

334
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,309
well as local<font color="#E5E5E5"> admins we're provided with</font>

335
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,138
a list now what you'll see is that the

336
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:19,819
same user that I we originally

337
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:22,730
compromised also happens to be an

338
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:24,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">administrator on that file server that</font>

339
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,209
may have been that may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font>

340
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,550
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can still use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that information</font>

341
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:29,660
for your reconnaissance the last thing

342
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,559
what we're going to do is run they

343
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:35,449
function get logged on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this does is</font>

344
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:37,850
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> does just what it says it finds the</font>

345
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:39,319
particular target server and it provides

346
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,480
you a list of who's currently logged on

347
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:43,128
to that machine we<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out that there's</font>

348
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,689
a domain administrator<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens to</font>

349
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:47,360
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> logged on to that same file server</font>

350
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:49,399
that conceptually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should be able to</font>

351
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,769
pivot to meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we're able to</font>

352
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,300
dump the<font color="#CCCCCC"> elsass or get the hashes we can</font>

353
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,369
then become the domain main

354
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,378
administrator so that's the

355
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:59,749
reconnaissance phase of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font>

356
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:02,059
attack so we now know what server we

357
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:04,189
want to pivot to we know what credential

358
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:06,439
we want to acquire it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of</font>

359
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:08,660
doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that's where the lateral</font>

360
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:10,279
movement<font color="#E5E5E5"> base comes into play here what</font>

361
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,170
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is we're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> identify</font>

362
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,720
that the file server<font color="#E5E5E5"> rule</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on get sued</font>

363
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,670
and so we can use many different ways to

364
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">laterally move within PowerShell Empire</font>

365
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:22,128
there's PS exec PS remoting through w my

366
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,519
calls there's many different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

367
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:27,550
chose to use of PS remoting for my demo

368
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,629
but any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those would work just as well</font>

369
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,248
so again what we're going to do is we're

370
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:32,149
going to hop over that file server dump

371
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:36,649
the creds and get the domain

372
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:38,929
administrator hash back to the show

373
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:43,759
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to re-establish a connection</font>

374
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:45,230
with our elevated you a seashell<font color="#CCCCCC"> we find</font>

375
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,819
there's our agents right there here's

376
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two shells we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interact</font>

377
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:53,209
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second one and we're going to</font>

378
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:56,990
copy and paste as you win the invoke

379
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:59,420
command<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the PS remoting you run that</font>

380
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,220
command execute it and then you'll see a

381
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,160
new shell will instantly connect this

382
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,619
new shell is going to be your file

383
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,600
server so there it is we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just been</font>

384
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:10,730
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to establish a new spell we've</font>

385
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,870
laterally moved to our file sir we're

386
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,910
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple shell commands</font>

387
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,340
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to demonstrate</font>

388
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:18,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">are successfully on that file so we're</font>

389
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:21,220
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> host name and you'll</font>

390
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:23,920
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are indeed moved did it to</font>

391
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,140
that file server we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run who</font>

392
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,479
is it still show that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are still that</font>

393
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:32,260
same user that standard music we haven't

394
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,490
escalated our privileges just yet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

395
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:39,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">next thing we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do is demonstrate</font>

396
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:41,500
credential dumping so let's see here let

397
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,730
it catch up with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a second running</font>

398
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,160
the creds command you see there's no

399
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,080
presidential stored in the database we

400
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,000
run mini cat it dumps it into memory so

401
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,060
it now<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough time as it ever stored on</font>

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">desk we're provided with the credentials</font>

403
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,780
we run presence again there we go there

404
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,719
are our credentials and hash and in

405
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,640
clear text<font color="#E5E5E5"> values now it's time to pass</font>

406
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hash so now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have the</font>

407
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,540

409
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,010

process running as the domain

administrator meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can do</font>

412
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,790
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> the domain administrator can do</font>

413
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:19,000
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it now too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so now we have</font>

414
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,189
established the persistence are the

415
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,680
access that we need on this attack okay

416
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,870
we've got pivoted access to the file

417
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,579
server and have acquired access to do

418
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,920
any domain administrator functionality

419
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,770
it's now time to move to the compromise

420
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,089
days this is where we establish our

421
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:36,370
persistence that's such a hard thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

422
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:38,770
say try establish<font color="#E5E5E5"> persistence or</font>

423
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,450
permanent persistence is even better so

424
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,790
what we're going to do now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the actual</font>

425
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:45,250
golden ticket attack and it all resides

426
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,920
around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kerberos hash it's a one-time</font>

427
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:50,830
hash in your Active Directory domain

428
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,930

affiliate all your machines to the

irrecoverable from it's almost

impossible so we're going to seal the

Kerberos hash and it's done through a

premium competency sync DC sink is a

process when a new domain controller

when we run credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> union there you go</font>

458
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:04,750
there's a Kerberos fashion if all we

we've once we've defined all the

required parameters we press execute and

471
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,310
we have generated a golden ticket we

have established permanent persistence

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:43,659
on the network so now we previously

listed file content where we previously

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,189
many different in games but again this

491
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,170
is what we chose to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

496
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,899
is previously we did have access to this

497

file server this is just directory

498

holding batch transactions that are

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,910
queued up ready to go at a certain time

500
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:43,200
we happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to manipulate one of the Swift</font>

501
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,090
transactions and this is what a

legitimate Swift transaction would look

503
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,590
like with the exception that $50,000

504
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,770
isn't going to the shadow systems hacker

controlling that it's automatic and it's

<font color="#E5E5E5">just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matter of executing the batch job</font>

that would have normally automatically

run it processes it and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go</font>

$50,000 furniture to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shadow systems</font>

513
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:18,300
yay there's only one last thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

514
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:20,310
here that's profit so well that<font color="#CCCCCC"> commit</font>

515
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,840
that's like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> total red side of the</font>

516
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:30,720
talk right so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we actually</font>

517
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:33,480
demonstrate at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time yes oh heck yeah</font>

518
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,910
this is the lousy 'used like noisiest

519
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,830
attack you could ever imagine but it

520
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,810
still happens and so many organizations

521
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:43,500
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have controls in place that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

522
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:45,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">even detect loud noisy amateur attacks</font>

523
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,270
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just demonstrated but yes very</font>

524
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">good point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of tell tell</font>

tell tell indicators of what's been

526
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,889
happens here and that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good very</font>

527
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,780
well segues into the next part of this

528
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,700
talk our identity access management best

529
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,490
practices really how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could have gone</font>

530
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">to prevent this and notified us of it</font>

531
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,510
happening as it's in play first is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

532
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,490
fact of<font color="#CCCCCC"> in point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in least privilege the</font>

533
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,980
first thing that we made a mistake was

534
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:12,690
having a local<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-user with local</font>

535
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,400
administrative rights on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> influence</font>

536
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,600
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would have probably been the</font>

537
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,520
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have done so</font>

538
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,070
remove the local admin right from the

539
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">end-user but there are certain cases in</font>

540
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,639
which a user needs their local admin

541
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,250
rights to run critical applications

542
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,140
right well there's I there's a least

543
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">privileged solutions out there that can</font>

544
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,870
elevate those particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> at binaries but</font>

545
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">still leave the underlying user in a non</font>

546
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:38,629
administrative state so again

547
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,669
removing local admin allow the

548
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:42,080
application that nuni do need elevated

549
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:44,299
rights to run but still let the

550
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,340
underlying user retain their local

551
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:48,679
standards user permissions the next

552
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> application control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

553
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,059
they may have access to run it we may

554
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,470
want not to allow that so blacklisting

555
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:56,960
whitelisting<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray listing are very</font>

556
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,850
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow an offer to block</font>

557
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,919
unnecessary applications from running

558
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,980
but allowing the approved applications

559
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,720
to run through now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really isn't an</font>

identity access management<font color="#E5E5E5"> best practice</font>

561
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,809
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still think it works being</font>

562
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,450
mentioned and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think network</font>

563
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:13,460
segmentation is a huge control to

564
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,620
protect against lateral movement in

565
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,840
particular so again not really about

566
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,549
practice but a good recommendation what

567
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">this does is if you can segment your</font>

568
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:24,500
network to the point where they cannot

569
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:26,539
pivot to those critical assets using

570
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,129
standard protocols and having controls

571
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:30,259
to monitor the protocols that you do

572
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:32,360
allow that will provide some level of

573
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:33,950
protection the next thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you</font>

00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,928
do have network segmentation you still

575
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,750
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to access those resources so i</font>

576
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:41,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend you need using jump servers or</font>

577
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:45,639
proxy dashing hosts to allow for access

578
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:48,889
of your sis<font color="#CCCCCC"> edmonds to administer an</font>

579
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:50,508
assistant or critical assets because if

580
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:51,918
you do that then those hashes won't

581
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:54,320
reside on the endpoint they'll live

582
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,149
reside on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jump servers because you</font>

583
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,279
can't pass the hash if you can't get the

584
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:59,899
hatch right and then lastly with jump

585
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,399
server you are provided a level of

586
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:03,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">accountability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and auditing so you can</font>

587
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:06,189
actually see what's being done with

588
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:08,000
those accounts on those those endpoints

589
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind of leads me to the next point</font>

590
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,559
of credential management securing in the

591
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,509
ng you're privileged provisions I love

592
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so you so much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> passwords to decrypt</font>

593
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:19,070
so whenever I ever get says your

594
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:20,600
passwords incorrect but seriously

595
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,970
there's three main components to a

596
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,580
secure password the first is unique if

597
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,230
you don't have if your passwords are the

598
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,668
same across your enterprise that means

599
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,620
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage that same password</font>

600
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:32,870
across your entire enterprise making

601
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,570
pass the hash super super easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

602
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,879
unique values mitigate that the next

603
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:41,149
thing is complex passwords maximizing

604
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:44,090
the ability of complexity of your

605
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:46,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">password really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thoughts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brute forcing</font>

606
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,689
and password cracking so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

607
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,400
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can still use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hash and</font>

608
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:52,230
it's been crept so that's why we

609
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">followed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day's ever</font>

610
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,460
changing frequently rotating passwords

611
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,410
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password</font>

612
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,910
that takes a month to crack but that

613
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:02,100
passwords changing once a week

614
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,630
automatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> that renders by the time</font>

615
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,520
that passwords been cracked it's changed

616
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,860
twice over so that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want those</font>

617
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,030
three tenets of a complex password the

618
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,649
next thing we've talked about this

619
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,470
several times over throughout our

620
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:16,950
conference today the multi-factor it's a

621
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:18,360
truly imperative to tie the identity to

622
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the account that's being used as you can</font>

623
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,139
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that with multi-factor</font>

624
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,000
authentication and now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a concept</font>

625
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">called a credential boundary this is</font>

626
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool it's really just we're going</font>

627
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:31,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do we're going to combine what we</font>

628
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,940
call functional accounts and credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

629
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,100
boundaries to show you what a mature

630
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">credential network would look like it</font>

631
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,530
looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when we talk</font>

632
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,540
about credential boundaries we're

633
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,760
talking horizontal I'm sorry vertical

634
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,260
balance this is your tier 0 construction

635
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,680
these are your domain controllers the

636
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">xxi has domain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name servers Union these</font>

637
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,690
are your correlate to your tier 0

638
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:54,449
control out of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> q0 assets use</font>

639
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,910
a stir recovery program<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so those</font>

640
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,920
domain credentials only operate at that

641
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,360
level if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your sim detects that they're</font>

642
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">being used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere outside of those</font>

00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">tr.0 assets that will be an incident</font>

644
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,379
that needs to be read so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll put it</font>

645
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:09,420
down here please<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're rolling it's</font>

646
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,310
there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next is you have your</font>

647
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,870
application server layer boundary again

648
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,220
you have application server credentials

649
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,560
that only operate within those

650
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,120
boundaries if you see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up above then</font>

651
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,679
that's a red flag if you see it below

652
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,469
yeah I was here too which is your

653
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,420
endpoint layer then you have potential

654
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,490
indicators of compromise so make sure

655
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,400
that you segment your network vertically

656
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,900
with credential boundaries now here's a

657
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">really key concept here and I touch</font>

658
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,800
something that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago when</font>

659
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:37,830
I mentioned multi-factor<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay identity</font>

660
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,080
identities are you meet everybody in

661
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:43,949
this room they're human beings blood and

662
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,320
flesh<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay an account not an</font>

663
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:48,120
identity these are just X values that

664
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,460
define permissions that's all they are

665
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,260
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one end of the same you</font>

666
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,990
don't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a one-to-one</font>

667
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:57,450
relationship of your passwords to your

668
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,860
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay think of it like this this</font>

669
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a construction set</font>

670
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,928
does everybody in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> construction site</font>

671
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:06,750
have a hammer maybe a<font color="#CCCCCC"> SkillSoft probably</font>

672
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,790
not a bulldozer heck no absolutely

673
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,140
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make cost-effective sentence so</font>

674
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:13,170
what you do is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a tool chest</font>

675
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you go to the tool chest you pick</font>

676
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,049
out the tool that you've been assigned

677
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use for the job that you've been</font>

678
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:19,920
assigned<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do you use that tool and you</font>

679
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,900
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right back for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

680
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,010
use and hold it accountable that's what

681
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,380
we want to start considering our

682
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:28,110
passwords are and our credentials so

683
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,690
think of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this okay here are five</font>

684
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,549
systems administrators<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's</font>

685
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,400
using the standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-level ad</font>

686
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:37,110
permissions to log on but we needed them

687
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,720
to do administrative functionality so we

688
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:42,270
provide them in secondary or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cena's</font>

689
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">ATM or bank account star accounts you</font>

690
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:46,440
name it but it delineate the fact that

691
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,639
you double the number of Provence in

692
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,400
your organization we've gone from<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

693
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ten now we have five privileged</font>

694
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,460
accounts and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned</font>

695
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:57,450
with what I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommend you do is</font>

696
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:59,760
still have the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time same low on non</font>

697
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:03,419
elevated account but each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of them</font>

698
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,620
check out one privileged account so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

699
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,179
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

700
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,340
granularly controlling it from a

701
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:10,919
password complexity rotation and

702
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,540
uniqueness so they just check it in and

703
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,490
check<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out whenever they need so what</font>

704
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,780
we've done is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've gone from five</font>

705
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,820
privileged accounts down to one

706
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">preferred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> account so i highly recommend</font>

707
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that functional account model for</font>

708
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:24,720
administrative users in particular so

709
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've demonstrated the horizontal to your</font>

710
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,530
boundaries and a functional accountant

711
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:30,270
model this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what it kind of boils down</font>

712
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:33,990
to when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a high level</font>

713
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:37,200
perspective that so we go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> unbounded</font>

714
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:39,900
completely flat to horizontal boundaries

715
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,370
and functional boundaries throw on a

so that is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the credential</font>

719
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,918
functionality there let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,210
ourselves because our vendors aren't

734
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:28,110
aggressions as well could have detected

00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,178
a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> indicators in our previous</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">set the DC sink that would be without a</font>

corresponding change control for

739
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,168
standing up a domain controller that

740
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:42,450
would be a pretty clear indicator last

741
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:44,910
behavior on alerting on behavior

742
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:47,940
nominees so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

in the morning from a Chinese IP without

that sort of analytical monitoring that

748
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,689
would we wouldn't be able to develop a

749

could be anything from<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs or IP</font>

00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:20,610
accessing all these can contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

755
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:24,658
their heuristic foot and then again

756
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:27,830
monitoring of access of your critical

757
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:30,240
assets that don't correlate to your

758

controls that you put into place<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

759
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,140
for example if you're using some sort of

760
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,790
privileged account security solution and

761
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,650
you see somebody i'm logging on to a

762
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:39,300
database server that didn't correlate to

763
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,070
an event where they check that same

766
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,290
there's somebody trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> circumvent</font>

767
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:50,040
your control so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some of the</font>

768
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:52,049
alerts that you can fire off on so in

769
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,059
conclusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's really four main</font>

770
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:56,190
tiers of controls that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can apply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:58,320
preventing<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced target attacks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

772
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,580
want you to understand these are just

773
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,220
some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that we've gone over</font>

774
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,199
today there's not one single solution

775
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,820
that will fix anything if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever have</font>

776
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,590
a vendor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Silver</font>

00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,830
talking

780
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">defensive depth is really the key to a</font>

784
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:25,750
provide you with the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

785
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:28,120
and again in point privileged privileged

786
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:30,160
for local least privilege and

787
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,689
application control followed by network

788
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,210
segmentation and routing through jump

794
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,740
complexity of your passwords and then

795
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,010
lastly monitoring on events and

00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:53,920

<font color="#E5E5E5">new but it's a new kind of direction</font>

801
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,810
that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of organizations are taking</font>

802
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,730
to dynamically provision accounts and

803
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:14,800
stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> in them up for use and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> D</font>

804
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:16,450
provision them it's it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to</font>

805
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,250
hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> your accounts accountable I know</font>

806
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sounds redundant but you need to be</font>

807
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,160
aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what accounts you have in your</font>

808
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,159
organization because quite often what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

809
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,870
see is like for example when a employee

810
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,130
is terminated in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> circumstance that</font>

811
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,020
they have those two accounts that I

812
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,000
demonstrated HR really only knows about

813
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the one so we won't need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:46,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like that thank you yes yes</font>

819
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:56,439
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my understanding that how you</font>

820
00:31:52,980 --> 00:32:00,610
basically provide access to lazy ass

821
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:04,440
fired you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> control to prevent</font>

822
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:15,939
users from having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

823
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:18,070
solutions all right let me see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I get</font>

824
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:22,330
this correct because you're talking

825
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:24,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how you AC is applied in this demo</font>

826
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:27,909
and what sort of controls can be applied

827
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:30,010
to allow legacy applications to run but

828
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:39,850
still provide the accountability of

829
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:43,809
having user access control exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

830
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:46,360
don't want to do that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not to</font>

831
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:48,730
make a<font color="#CCCCCC"> clock super been very but there</font>

832
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,830
are applications out there such as in

833
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:53,410
point privilege management that do just

834
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:55,449
that they that all their job is is to

835
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:57,670
facilitate least privilege for users

836
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:59,380
elevating the legacy applications that

837
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:02,080
are needing local administrative rights

838
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,030
but still not allowing the underlying

839
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,889
standard user to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> local</font>

840
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,350
administrator so again that would be

841
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:14,920
probably a conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love to head</font>

842
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:17,469
with the offline here you go I was doing

843
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,000
this at a conference in Oklahoma and I

844
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:21,070
have talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guy weighed the back</font>

845
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,740
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i chunked it just like dak Prescott</font>

846
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:27,220
which was awesome to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cowboys but I</font>

847
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:29,470
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> pegged the project so it was</font>

848
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,679
that good that yes I saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> their inhibitor</font>

849

yeah

location may use stage and then is on

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,489

the programs like loading in here my
