conference well I was talking to Greg

21
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,809
and he asked me to come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk</font>

22
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">miscible what do you want me to talk</font>

23
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">about and he said well we get so little</font>

24
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,100
legal advice just talk about whatever

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,890
you want to know my gosh it's terrible

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,509
um so I'm just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

27
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">something really basic today which is</font>

28
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:33,939
what do you do after you have a data

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:37,600
breach you really need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

30
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:40,479
methodical solution so just a couple of

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,839
disclaimers I am NOT talking about the

32
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,249
technology side that's what you guys do

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,929
that's what you're here to learn about

34
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:51,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">later today I'm going to address some of</font>

35
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:55,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stuff from a legal perspective which</font>

36
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:58,359
is what you do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you do it but</font>

37
00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:01,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">what I am doing here is not legal advice</font>

38
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:04,030
you need to have specific advice that

39
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:06,999
specific to your organization in your

40
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:11,350
situation I'm just giving you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some basic</font>

41
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:14,170
information I am NOT going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">focusing on regulated industries the</font>

43
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,059
rules for regulated industries are

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,130
different I'm talking about non

45
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,230
regulated industries and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

46
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:27,160
about companies that are only holding

47
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:29,200
domestic information a lot of that stuff

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,910
adds a lot of complicating factors

49
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,060
regulated and raising the<font color="#CCCCCC"> international</font>

50
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">almond so I have a pretty narrow focus</font>

51
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,150
but I hope that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will find this</font>

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,950
information helpful<font color="#CCCCCC"> within that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> narrow</font>

53
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:44,360
focus and the last thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you have</font>

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions feel free to jump in anytime</font>

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,830
Greg's got the mic so that everyone in

56
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:52,810
the room can hear you so just raise your

57
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:55,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand and he'll come over and find you so</font>

58
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,440
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> start out with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the scope of the</font>

59
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,090
data breach problem is just stuff that

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,020
probably most of you are already aware

61
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:05,420
of but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just put this in perspective we</font>

62
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,280
have had an increasing number of data

63
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,970
breaches over time those were the years

64
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:20,080
i could find information for so 2012 we

65
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:23,750
had 447 2013 614 2014 783 in all since

66
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,630
2005 there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been about 5,400 data</font>

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:30,140
breaches and more than 900 10 million

68
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,940
individual records have been breached so

69
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,079
these numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are only the ones we know</font>

70
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,800
about these are the ones that have been

71
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,530
discovered and then made public there's

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,440
a if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom there</font>

companies that have had data breaches it

79
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,420
is axiomatic in the industry at this

80
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:05,000
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is not a matter of if it</font>

is a matter of when<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> company will</font>

00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,340
visited their car wash during a

145
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,810
particular week and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was looking</font>

146
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,200
through the privacy rights<font color="#CCCCCC"> Clearing</font>

147
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">House Records and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw this</font>

148
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:25,229
ridiculously large number of car washes

149
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:28,500
had to announce a breach around the same

150
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:30,960
time and all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them said something</font>

151
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,260
about their third party payment process

152
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,729
are having a breach this is a point that

153
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,530
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring up more than once</font>

154
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:41,010
during this presentation and that is

155
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,690
that even though the data holder may be

156
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,450
the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has to make the announcement</font>

157
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:48,330
about the breach you can transfer that

158
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:51,810
obligation by contract and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to</font>

159
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:54,180
me what must have happened here that all

160
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,730
of these car washes we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

161
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party payment process or who had</font>

162
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,050
somewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> its contract that nobody</font>

163
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever reads they just click</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok move on</font>

164
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,240
with our day that if there is a data

165
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">breach you have to be the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

166
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,700
announce it to your customers and you

167
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:14,220
have to not use our name because none of

168
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,870
these car washes used in the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

169
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,590
whoever this third-party payment

170
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:22,170
processor was that lost the data so when

171
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,510
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in negotiating</font>

172
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,690
contracts at your company to the extent

173
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,010
you get to be involved I hope you are

174
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:32,309
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look out</font>

175
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">for who is going to be making the data</font>

176
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,549
breach announcements and how are they

177
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:38,219
going to be making them or if you're

178
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,990
evaluating different vendors you might

179
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,720
want to pick the one that's not going to

180
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:45,360
make you publicly<font color="#CCCCCC"> announce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you lost</font>

181
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,320
the credit card information that they

182
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:53,100
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> lost looking at some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

183
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:56,760
other breaches you notice a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

184
00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:00,030
medical names on their small medical

185
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,550
groups are very target or rich targets

186
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:05,069
right now because they don't have a lot

187
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,380
of resources to prevent a breach but

188
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,510
they have a lot of information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

189
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,500
people would like

190
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:16,120
to have very personal information that

191
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,120
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used in a lot of different ways</font>

192
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,500
let's see oh and the metropolitan

193
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">urology group is particularly</font>

194
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,060
interesting they had a problem with some

195
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:29,709
ransomware which is getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

196
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,709
bigger and bigger problem these days

197
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,760
let's see and this just goes back to the

198
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,640
problems with everybody using the same

199
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,210
service provider so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you a</font>

200
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,210
minute to read

201
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,079
but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be perfectly honest I really just</font>

202
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,030
wanted an excuse to let you all<font color="#CCCCCC"> see an</font>

203
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:06,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">XKCD comic in the middle of my</font>

204
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:09,130
presentation so all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so when</font>

205
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,520
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a data breach you get a warning</font>

206
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:15,010
something is wrong you're seeing unusual

207
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">file movement you're seeing things on</font>

208
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,900
your firewall not really pings on your

209
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,520
fire while I just said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

210
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:24,819
somebody was complaining to me about not

211
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,130
having any sort of systemic response in

212
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,230
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> company and they're saying well</font>

213
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,939
the CEO wants to be informed of

214
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,970
everything am I supposed to tell them

215
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,740
about a very ping on our firewall so I

216
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might find that funny okay</font>

217
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,650
so when you first notice a play<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

218
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,500
problem it's going to be unclear what

219
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,670
the problem is but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since this</font>

220
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,440
is really important of course you

221
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,469
already have a plan in place to<font color="#CCCCCC"> cover it</font>

222
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,360
right raise your hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you already</font>

223
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,360
have a place plan in place to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover it</font>

224
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:01,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">not nearly as many people as I was</font>

225
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,420
expecting to see about four-fifths of

226
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:08,020
companies have a data breach response

227
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:11,829
plan as of 2015 according to experience

228
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:14,620
now how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you are confident that</font>

229
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:19,720
the plan you have in place is going to

230
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:23,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">work I see one hand to two hands in the</font>

231
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,820
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> only about a third of companies are</font>

232
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:29,140
confident<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the plan that they have</font>

233
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:31,690
in place will work now having a plan is

234
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,900
not just a good idea it's actually the

235
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:37,990
law if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information from</font>

236
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:40,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who live in Massachusetts I am</font>

237
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,190
not aware of any other states<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,100
actually have anything as comprehensive

239
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,960
as Massachusetts requirement but they

240
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,260
require you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have is a comprehensive</font>

241
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,450
information security plan you have to

242
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">develop it you have to implement it you</font>

243
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,850
have to maintain it and it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

244
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,520
administrative technical and physical

245
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,770
safeguards and it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

246
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,740
understandable to just you know regular

247
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,880
guy on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> streets and having data on a</font>

248
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:11,000
single Massachusetts resin

249
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,730
then triggers this requirement so unless

250
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are completely confident that nobody</font>

251
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:23,930
who lives in Boston has ever used your

252
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:27,020
services you should have a plan so let's

253
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:29,930
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plan but you're not</font>

254
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:33,439
very confident in it or you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

255
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:35,359
plan what do you do you don't panic

256
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,610
because now we're going to stop talk

257
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:45,590
through the steps that<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be in your</font>

258
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:48,080
plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is who needs to</font>

259
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,000
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in the creation of your plan</font>

260
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,700
and its implementation if you already

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,700
have one you need to have security

262
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,740
technology legal customer service and PR

263
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,900
or communications whoever you've gotten

264
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,720
your company depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> size of</font>

265
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:06,620
your company these might be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same two</font>

266
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,580
people they might be 20 different people

267
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,620
it's hard to say but if you do have a

268
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,840
plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it doesn't include the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roles</font>

269
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,030
and responsibilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all of these</font>

270
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:21,440
different departments you need to go

271
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:26,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and update your plan as a quick</font>

272
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,280
aside this picture here I was google

273
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:31,690
searching through the creative commons

274
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,430
for diverse business meeting and

275
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:37,490
literally half of the photos that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came</font>

276
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:43,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">up had Vladimir Putin in them so we're</font>

277
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:46,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">just saying I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

278
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:48,440
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about the things</font>

279
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">that your plan should cover and we're</font>

280
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,240
going to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to these sort of</font>

281
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,680
marking your spot slides<font color="#CCCCCC"> on right now</font>

282
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then and whatever's in yellow is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

283
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,280
next thing I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about so</font>

284
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,609
right now I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about steps</font>

285
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:05,750
to follow and the first step to follow

286
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:08,290
is escalation it is concurrent with the

287
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:11,810
next step to follow which is

288
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:14,780
investigation so here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people you</font>

289
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:18,140
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about what point in time</font>

290
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,240
am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contact these people your</font>

291
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,290
chief information officer and your

292
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,880
lawyers

293
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,189
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the size</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your company</font>

294
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,930
the chief information officer and your

295
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:33,320
main internal or external counsel might

296
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:35,239
be to the first people you contact you

297
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,430
know if we're we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a 3m</font>

298
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,079
they're going to be you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

299
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,888
counsel and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chief information</font>

300
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:44,269
officer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CEO are going to be very</font>

301
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:45,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">late in the process you're not going to</font>

302
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:50,709
contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> them until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you find out Russia</font>

303
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:55,160
hack to you right but you need to know

304
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:56,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you will contact them that's one of</font>

305
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,209
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have in the</font>

306
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:02,509
plan is what are the triggering events

307
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:05,839
at what point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time is it worth waking</font>

308
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:08,240
up the CEO at two in the morning if

309
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,329
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> your employee who stole the</font>

310
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,279
1600 Social Security numbers yeah that's

311
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:15,380
a big deal but it's not a wake up the

312
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,410
CEO at two in the morning big deal if

313
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:21,199
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have Russian hackers infiltrating</font>

314
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,910
your systems that's probably a wake up

315
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:28,939
the CEO at two in the morning kind of

316
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:31,610
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal for external contact your data</font>

317
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:33,680
forensics consultant is going to be one

318
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the first people you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to contact</font>

319
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">do we have any data forensics</font>

320
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:42,019
consultants in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are a</font>

321
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:45,110
couple so are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys the first people</font>

322
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:50,060
that should be contacted<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're nodding</font>

323
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:52,660
yes and part of the reason for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

324
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:55,310
that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help you not</font>

325
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,620
destroy evidence that's one of the most

326
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,810
important things that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is make</font>

327
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,329
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're keeping very good records as</font>

328
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:07,130
what you have done and what happened

329
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:09,769
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you started doing it alright so</font>

330
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,449
the next interlocked step which I've

331
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:17,089
sort of started talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

332
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:18,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> already right is investigation so</font>

333
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:23,000
bring in the cavalry that's that

334
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:25,970
external data forensics consultant if

335
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,949
you can afford it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably want to</font>

336
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,170
bring in outside help in all of those

337
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:33,240
areas i was talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside legal</font>

338
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:37,949
help outside consulting help

339
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:40,230
side PR help just because in these

340
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,330
situations or you don't want to bring

341
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,850
them in in every situation but you want

342
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:48,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a list of people who you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font>

343
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:51,390
to if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation demands it and</font>

344
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:55,529
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have those relationships in</font>

345
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:59,189
place so again don't destroy evidence

346
00:16:55,529 --> 00:17:00,930
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people on hand who can help you</font>

347
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:04,020
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you don't destroy</font>

348
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:06,510
evidence not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only is the evidence</font>

349
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,449
important if there is any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of law</font>

350
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:13,470
enforcement going on with this but it's

351
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:15,240
also important if you get sued over what

352
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:18,360
happened later you want to be able to

353
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,910
show that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did everything right or at</font>

354
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:24,809
least show that you did as many things

355
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:27,329
as you could write you want to notify

356
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:29,970
law enforcement who exactly that is is

357
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:33,240
going to depend on what happened and

358
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:36,480
what your company is so again that is

359
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,420
the whole triggering events element of

360
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,600
the plan and you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

361
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,420
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking the right question what</font>

362
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,059
specifically was compromised what can we

363
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:51,390
do to prevent further damage can this

364
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:54,678
system be quarantined what data can be

365
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:57,600
salvaged what data can we still trust

366
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,550
can we figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> who did it that might</font>

367
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,649
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of law enforcement problem but</font>

368
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:04,530
it might help you figure out how you're

369
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:08,790
going to react<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there is</font>

370
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:13,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the big legal question which is is it a</font>

371
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:16,500
data breach as defined by law there can

372
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,420
be breaches of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> system that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

373
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,540
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you as a company like</font>

374
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:24,270
someone gets hold of your trade secret

375
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,678
you have to tell well you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

376
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,860
tell some people that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

377
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,020
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers about it the data</font>

378
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,270
breaches that get a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attention in</font>

379
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,280
the media tend to be the ones where

380
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:39,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">people's Social Security numbers and</font>

381
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,870
credit card numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are stolen so it's</font>

382
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:45,900
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that someone in your company</font>

383
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,949
know the applicable laws one question

384
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get all</font>

385
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:52,050
time is is there a strictest law that we

386
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:57,060
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just comply with and not worry about</font>

387
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:59,970
the 50 different state laws and several

388
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:03,990
different laws of us protectorates and

389
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:06,480
so on and unfortunately the answer to

390
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:09,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is no there is no strictest law</font>

391
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,020
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just different requirements</font>

392
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,480
some states include biometric data if

393
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:18,629
you lose biometric data some states

394
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:23,010
include genetic data some don't so if

395
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:24,950
your breach includes people from you

396
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:28,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a state that doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> include</font>

397
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,450
genetic data and your 23andme you don't

398
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:35,210
have to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you lost their</font>

399
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:37,380
genetic information let's see

400
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,650
Massachusetts<font color="#CCCCCC"> and California are ones</font>

401
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,610
that you should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of because</font>

402
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:46,890
Massachusetts is the one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> requires</font>

403
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:49,889
the plan and California just has a very

404
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:52,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">active enforcement although</font>

405
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:55,140
interestingly the Attorney General who

406
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:58,230
was in charge of enforcement in

407
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,840
California Kamala Harris is now one of

408
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,370
the state senators for California so one

409
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,189
of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might see out of</font>

410
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:07,679
that and fingers<font color="#CCCCCC"> crossed is federal</font>

411
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,260
legislation that covers this stuff so

412
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can supersede this patchwork of</font>

413
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:15,780
50 different laws to comply wit that's

414
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,550
what happened with canned spam back in

415
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,139
the early 2000s there were all these

416
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,610
state laws coming out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

417
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,190
federal government says hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

418
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:26,969
silly let's just have one rule that

419
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:34,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">would make your jobs much much easier if</font>

420
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:37,320
we just had one law<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what is a</font>

421
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,960
data breach then if it means very so

422
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">much it's generally the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unauthorized</font>

423
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,640
acquisition of computerized data<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

424
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,190
that compromises the security

425
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,200
confidentiality or integrity of personal

426
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:53,370
information maintained by a data

427
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:56,220
collector so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I underlined some of the</font>

428
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:59,928
important words there unauthorized means

429
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:02,480
that if it was an authorized person it

430
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:04,700
a data breach unless they use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

431
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,850

436
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:23,450
consistent requirement most of the state

437
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:26,740
laws deal only with computerized data

438
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:30,470
but there's a handful that just say data

439
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:33,200
so you'll occasionally hear about things

440
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,669
where I'm not going to say the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

the company because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not entirely</font>

outside back and it had full credit card

446
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:53,889

<font color="#E5E5E5">several years ago now it wasn't actually</font>

violation of the state data breach law

449
00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:04,220
it wound up that the FTC enforced it as

450
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:06,889
a violation of unfair competition laws

451
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,169
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the federal level but it wasn't a</font>

violation of the state's data breach law

453
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:14,330
because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state didn't include paper</font>

464
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,959
because by contracts in most states you

465
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:45,230
can voice the obligations on someone

466
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:50,210
else so moving back to personal

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,939
so as information security professionals

these are the kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information that</font>

00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:17,119
in most but not all state

476
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:22,269
is that if this information is encrypted

477
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:26,749
or redacted or otherwise technologically

478
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:28,850
secured and the bad guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in and get</font>

the information but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't know how</font>

480
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:33,949
to unencrypt it you know they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

481
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:37,119
they didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your key for unencrypted</font>

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:40,190
it or unredacted it or otherwise

483
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:44,439
technologically freeing it it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

484
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:48,309
breach you don't have to do all of the

485
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:51,590
informing people steps of what happened

486
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:55,190
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Iowa is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those states that</font>

487
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:58,100
does not require if it's in encrypted

488
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:04,460
form I would does not require that you

489
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:06,498
do the data breach notification so this

490
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:11,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">is really the main legal obligation</font>

491
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:11,379
point is the we have a question

492
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:19,220
everything about like username and

493
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,690
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> conditioning or authentication</font>

494
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:27,799
information is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> illegal</font>

495
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:31,159
it probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in a few state I couldn't</font>

496
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:39,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you which one as I had to guess I</font>

497
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:44,630
would guess California right right right

498
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:46,850
so a that was just a general list of the

499
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:49,100
kinds of things I mean if I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font>

500
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:51,709
broad categories of what those

501
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,918
requirements are it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,350
contact information sensitive financial

503
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:00,230
numbers and health-related information

504
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:03,408
is usually going to be subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

505
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:06,559
data breach laws but you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

506
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:09,889
give anything specific in this context

507
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:12,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so response is in reporting this is</font>

508
00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:13,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">a part where all those laws are making</font>

509
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,820
you go out and do something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

510
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:21,080
mentioned reporting several times it's

511
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:23,450
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in the form of oh wait we</font>

512
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,080
don't want to stop yet sorry it's going

513
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be in the form of sending letters to</font>

514
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:35,120
people or contacting the media or

515
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:39,309
sending emails to people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

516
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:42,860
affected by a breach now we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop</font>

517
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:46,549
before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do reporting you need to</font>

518
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,350
check two things the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is those</font>

519
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:50,809
contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

520
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:54,320
someone elses obligation to report based

521
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:58,220
on your company's contract the second

522
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,320
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is law enforcement do you remember</font>

523
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,190
we already contacted law enforcement way

524
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,710
back when we were doing the

525
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,690
investigation and escalation step well

526
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,240
if law enforcement tells you I don't

527
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">want you to contact the victims yet</font>

528
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,370
because I'm still figuring out what

529
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,080
happened on my end and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I can</font>

530
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,629
catch the bad guys you do what law

531
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,120
enforcement tells you just about every

532
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:22,850
law has an exception<font color="#CCCCCC"> to its required</font>

533
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,908
timeframe for the notification for the

534
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:27,320
needs of law enforcement when these laws

535
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:30,799
were first starting to come out

536
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,970
everybody said within 45 days but you

537
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">know not if law enforcement says not</font>

538
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:39,120
then everybody said 30 days and now

539
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:42,299
everybody says as expeditiously as

540
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:47,178
possible but consistent with the needs

541
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:50,460
of law enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wouldn't push that</font>

542
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:53,280
past 30 or 45 days if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at all</font>

543
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:57,000
avoid it because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to be</font>

544
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:01,230
the company who has the test case case

545
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,500
of what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> does as expeditiously as</font>

546
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,940
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you don't want to be the</font>

547
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:12,809
guy who's like well I thought six months

548
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:15,659
was fine right no all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so the steps</font>

549
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:18,780
to follow response is reporting you've

550
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:21,809
got required reporting and non required

551
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:24,870
reporting we've talked about law

552
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:27,110
enforcement if you're a public company

553
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:29,820
you might have to tell your investors

554
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:32,309
you should talk to your lawyer about

555
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:37,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether a breach is significant enough</font>

556
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:40,918
to trigger an 8k report depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

557
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:43,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">size of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the breach and the state you may</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">have to tell the state attorney general</font>

you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell regulators if</font>

561
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:54,840
you're in a regulated industry you may

00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:58,590
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell credit reporting agencies</font>

563
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:01,470
depending on the state you might have to

564
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:04,049
report to the media if you don't have

565
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,820
contact information for your customers

566
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,889
or again depending on the state some

567
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:11,789
states make you fall on your sword no

568
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:15,260
matter what and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do have to tell</font>

your affected customers in every state

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are also some excuse me some</font>

571

communications that are not required but

572
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,129
are just a good idea you want to tell

your employees before<font color="#CCCCCC"> they find out from</font>

00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:42,570
lawyer who does that particular type of

579
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:44,010
law but you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway</font>

580
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,300
because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want them coming to</font>

581
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,250
you

582
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:50,060
saying hey why am i hearing about this

583
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:52,520
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the paper and then you may want to</font>

584
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">have media statements prepared that are</font>

585
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,480
beyond what is legally required because

586
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,129
sometimes the media finds out about

587
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,500
things while you're right in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle</font>

588
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:03,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of figuring out what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the heck happened</font>

589
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:08,200
and you want to have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

590
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,200
little more reassuring than no comment

591
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:15,590
so in view of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you should have these</font>

592
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:17,780
statements prepared ahead of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

593
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:20,179
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have breached letter templates</font>

594
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,550
for your customers credit reporting

595
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:26,300
agencies and any required media

596
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:28,220
statements you want to have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font>

597
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you're going to tell any regulators</font>

598
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,680
that you need to inform and your

599
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,570
investors and employees you want to have

600
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,540
those template non-required media

601
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:40,760
statement the other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

602
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:42,560
might want to consider is because these

603
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,450
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be really fast</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pacific you</font>

604
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,220
probably can't have prepared templates

605
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,080
for these but you might want to have on

606
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,820
hand a list of the kinds of things that

607
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,370
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to need to let your insurer</font>

608
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:58,340
know about and let in law enforcement

609
00:29:52,370 --> 00:30:01,060
know about and so what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hang</font>

610
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">up yes</font>

611
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:16,530
first our<font color="#CCCCCC"> targets are bringing in it</font>

612
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,840
that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work for you or is</font>

613
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">under control and prevent pollution</font>

614
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,500
control

615
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:30,830
not acting and we want Alexis<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

616
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,990
the question is how do you prevent

617
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:38,330
losing control of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the situation when you</font>

618
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:42,769
bring in law enforcement and my answer

619
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:45,649
is you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't try not try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

620
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:47,570
because if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything that they</font>

621
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:49,250
consider to be interference with their

622
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,168
investigation you've just brought a

623
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:55,070
whole new level of trouble on your

624
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:57,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">company when you are contacting law</font>

625
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,720
enforcement you want to be smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

626
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:02,240
which law enforcement you're contacting

627
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,720
you don't want to just call the local

628
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,149
police no matter what happened you might

629
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,240
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a list of contacts oh</font>

630
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:12,799
you've already<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a relationship</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

631
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:17,000
which actually is something I'm covering

632
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:20,210
a little later which like so the the

633
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,570
local FBI agent in charge of cybercrime

634
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:26,179
you want to call that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person up say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hi</font>

635
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:28,000
introduce yourself and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

636
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:32,929
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a relationship before</font>

637
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:36,260
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened I hear the guy we had</font>

638
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:38,929
in Iowa is leaving he got promoted good

639
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:44,690
for him so if you already have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

640
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:46,250
contact be ready to refresh it ok so the

641
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:51,559
kinds of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to include</font>

642
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:53,840
in these breach reports this is specific

643
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:56,450
to the reports that you're sending to

644
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,178
your customers who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are affected you want</font>

645
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:01,760
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what you know how it</font>

646
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:03,559
happened what information<font color="#CCCCCC"> was taken and</font>

647
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,950
how the seeds<font color="#E5E5E5"> have used the information</font>

648
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:08,870
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you already know that you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

649
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:10,820
tell them<font color="#CCCCCC"> what remedial actions you're</font>

650
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:12,350
taking so how are you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

651
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,789
this doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen to them again why</font>

652
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">should they keep trusting you with their</font>

653
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:19,010
information you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

654
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:24,019
protective actions that your company is

655
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:26,840
taking to fix what happened and also

656
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:30,169
what your victims can do there's a great

657
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,919
website that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just send people to</font>

658
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:34,560
its identity theft

659
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">gov and it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always have current</font>

660
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,639
information about steps people can take

00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:42,060
to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a data</font>

662
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,920
breach you want to have contact

663
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,050
information that where people can

664
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,410
contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in your organization who</font>

665
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:51,899
can answer any questions that they have

666
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:53,730
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to someone last night who</font>

667
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,640
had had a day data breaches their

668
00:32:53,730 --> 00:33:00,270
organization and he told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that they</font>

669
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,040
sent out their letters and you know they

670
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:07,200
were all ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer any questions</font>

671
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:10,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">and one person called and that one</font>

672
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,620
person had one question<font color="#CCCCCC"> and after they</font>

673
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:17,070
answer the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question the person says oh</font>

674
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:19,979
whatever so you may not have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot to do</font>

675
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:23,700
if there's a data breach but you should

676
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">be ready to answer questions then you</font>

677
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the letter</font>

678
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:30,720
includes how you will contact them in

679
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:33,030
the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent re victimization</font>

680
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,310
by someone who comes in posing as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

681
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:37,980
because they heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this big data</font>

682
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,510
breach and they're thinking oh I can get

683
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">these people to tell me something on the</font>

684
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:45,120
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I call them and you also want</font>

685
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:49,050
to include any additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

686
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,929
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is required by law since word Iowa</font>

687
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:54,659
I included that Iowa also requires this

688
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:57,810
letter to include advice to the consumer

689
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,760
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> report suspected incidents of</font>

690
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:02,850
identity theft to local law enforcement

691
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,410
or the Attorney General which is not a

692
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:09,089
big deal to include but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

693
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:10,860
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in trouble</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> include it so</font>

694
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,200
tips for these communications which you

695
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:16,679
should all<font color="#CCCCCC"> be involved in writing it's</font>

696
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">really important that you folks be</font>

697
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,190
involved in writing these communications

698
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:21,719
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to be the ones who fill</font>

699
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,520
in the blanks in these letters and you

700
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:25,678
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the ones who have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer</font>

701
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,020
questions when the phone calls come in

702
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:32,850
so these communications need to be

703
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:35,820
honest don't lie if you have to omit

704
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:38,009
information it should be because law

705
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,770
enforcement told you to omit the

706
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,310
information because of their ongoing

707
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:44,219
investigation

708
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,960
it should give information to consumers

709
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:49,589
about how they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can protect themselves</font>

710
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,179
and you don't give information again

711
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:55,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might put them at further risk you</font>

712
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,129
consult<font color="#CCCCCC"> with law enforcement on that one</font>

713
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,530
when you're doing these letters I just

714
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,070
like to point out might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good time</font>

715
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:07,220
to pitch projects that you've been

716
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,780
wanting to get done at your company

717
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,910
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things you're going</font>

718
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">to want to do is be involved in deciding</font>

719
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:19,770
which kinds of letters you should be

720
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,570
prepared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send which kinds of breaches</font>

721
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:24,509
do you think your system is most

722
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:27,960
vulnerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and that might be the time</font>

723
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:30,990
to say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey we could fix this if</font>

724
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,670
you give me budget for next year and

725
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:36,240
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we won't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to send this letter</font>

726
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:38,490
right the other thing that these letters

727
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,919
need to do is anticipate what the

728
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,470
questions will be and answer them in

729
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,480
advance I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of them that are</font>

730
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:49,470
just an FAQ format and that works really

731
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:57,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">well for people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so our next</font>

732
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:58,560
step in our plan is remediation so one

733
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,480
of the things you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font>

734
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,520
you do is if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that was</font>

735
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,410
breached winds up on website make sure

736
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,410
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it taken down and make sure you</font>

737
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:11,040
include<font color="#E5E5E5"> any cash information in search</font>

738
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:13,770
engines you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a position to</font>

739
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,560
make sure that the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of hack</font>

740
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,840
never happened twice so when you bring

741
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">in those outside consultants after all</font>

742
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the excitement is done they're going</font>

743
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,680
to have recommendations for you to make

744
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that this does not happen again you</font>

745
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,660
need to follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> the remedial steps that</font>

746
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:33,360
are in the forensic report it might be

747
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,640
training it might be hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idiot</font>

748
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,920
clicked on a link and it brought down

749
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,690
your whole system for a day you need to

750
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure your employees know not to</font>

751
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,400
click on those kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of links it might</font>

752
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:47,939
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you need some new software I was</font>

753
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,490
doing a walkthrough the other day<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

754
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,650
involves a foreign state actor getting

755
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,979
into a bank system because they were too

756
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,200
cheap to buy

757
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,540
outside software I don't know if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

758
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,839
based on a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation or not big</font>

759
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:05,619
disclaimer but they had done their own

760
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:08,890
homegrown encryption and it wasn't as

761
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:09,910
good as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cover site I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it wasn't</font>

762
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:13,118
as good as commercially available

763
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:15,040
software so<font color="#E5E5E5"> their remediation was go pay</font>

764
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,369
people who know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they're doing next</font>

765
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,410
time it might be new hardware it's

766
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:23,770
possible that somebody just walked right

767
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:25,359
into your hardware location and got in

768
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:28,390
that way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should make sure you</font>

769
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,220
have hardware that isn't susceptible to

770
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:33,580
that and also locks on the doors locks

771
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:35,680
on the doors are good you may need to

772
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell your service providers that they</font>

773
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,839
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make some changes and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

774
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,369
need new service providers you may say

775
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,310
look we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't trust this</font>

776
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:47,710
third-party payment provider anymore

777
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:49,690
with our car wash and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

778
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,900
to find somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's not going to make</font>

779
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:55,090
us fall in our swords next time the

780
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,950
other thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about from</font>

781
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,900
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information security perspective is</font>

782
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:02,379
to see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network segmentation</font>

783
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:05,619
works the way it should don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me any</font>

784
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:09,820
questions about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> lets you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

785
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:15,400
so the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps are reevaluation and</font>

786
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:17,200
practice after you have had a breach you

787
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,859
need to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at your plan</font>

788
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,450
again and say did this work did it do

789
00:38:20,859 --> 00:38:24,940
what it was supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what can we</font>

790
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:26,350
do about our next time because there's

791
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:30,310
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a next time it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not if it's</font>

792
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:34,210
when and then you need to practice the

793
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:37,480
plan periodically this practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions</font>

794
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:40,119
might be scheduled or unscheduled you

795
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,040
may actually have obligations especially

796
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:46,540
in regulated industries to have these

797
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:49,119
unscheduled drills and your regulators

798
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,950
if you're in a regulated industry are

799
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,320
usually willing to run these drills with

800
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:55,509
you I have heard but not actually

801
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,359
confirmed that you know when you build

802
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:00,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that relationship with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the FBI agent the</font>

803
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:03,310
FBI agent is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be willing to run</font>

804
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,990
through with you as well they may want

805
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to schedule</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at once though when playing</font>

806
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:09,538
them

807
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:11,249
okay so now we have walked through the

808
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:13,319
steps that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should follow in your</font>

809
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:15,868
plan now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

810
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:17,160
there's a few appendices that your plan

811
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:20,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">should have and we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

812
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:23,069
about what should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in those appendices</font>

813
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:25,410
the first one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the regulatory</font>

814
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:29,819
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> in context</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are a</font>

815
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:32,819
regulated industry you you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of</font>

816
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:35,910
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know that if there's a breach</font>

817
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:37,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">of HIPAA information there's certain</font>

818
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:39,779
people you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to tell about it make</font>

819
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:41,130
sure all of our contact information is

820
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:43,380
in your appendix and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

821
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:46,710
regularly updated when you hear oh by

822
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,630
the way this person has moved on or that

823
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've got maybe a website where you</font>

824
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,940
know that you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to find the</font>

825
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:55,349
current contact information every time

00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:57,779
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the financial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> industry there's</font>

827
00:39:55,349 --> 00:40:01,289
a lot of regulations<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they will</font>

828
00:39:57,779 --> 00:40:03,690
involve contacting people if your

829
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:05,609
company is included in those critical

830
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,900
infrastructure regulations that were

831
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:09,180
promulgated under the Obama

832
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,769
administration there may be specific

833
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,779
people that you need to contact when

834
00:40:10,769 --> 00:40:15,450
something goes wrong their contact

835
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:17,430
information should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their state</font>

836
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:18,538
data breach laws<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned that you</font>

837
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:20,609
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to talk to the attorney</font>

838
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:23,579
general but different states have

839
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:25,799
different requirements I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

840
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:27,720
one of them we have no I'm sorry

841
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:30,170
Massachusetts I'm thinking of nevermind

842
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,308
so in Massachusetts there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

843
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,980
subdivision of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the governor's office</font>

844
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:36,960
that you have to contact to let know of

845
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:41,309
the breach in addition to the Attorney

846
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,259
General Social Security number laws I

847
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:45,749
haven't talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much but there</font>

848
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:48,599
are special requirements for how you

849
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:50,759
treat<font color="#CCCCCC"> social security numbers and of</font>

850
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">course there are 50 of them and of</font>

851
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:55,079
course they sometimes conflict with one

852
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:56,910
another you know unlike the data breach

853
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,890
laws which may just have different

854
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:00,149
requirements there are actual

855
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,670
requirements and some of the social

856
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:05,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">security number laws that say you have</font>

857
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:07,739
to reject this part in this state but

858
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:11,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other part in a different state it's</font>

859
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:13,230
very frustrating but those may also have

860
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">contacts you may have to contact</font>

861
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:17,279
specific people in specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> states in</font>

862
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,710
the event of a social security<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">rate</font>

864
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:27,480
and then the FTC this one is generally

865
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:29,830
you're going to know already if the FTC

866
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:34,210
needs to be informed because you're

867
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:35,950
probably already in trouble but if they

868
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:39,460
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be informed you need to make</font>

869
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:41,410
sure you know who to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again all</font>

870
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,839
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these contacts there's going to be</font>

871
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:46,118
triggers for contacting them make sure

872
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just call everybody right at</font>

873
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:49,720
the start don't just flip to the back

874
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and start making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phone calls because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

875
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,790
don't know what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

876
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:57,130
panic mode we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to panic and</font>

877
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:58,960
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be telling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people things that</font>

878
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,820
you didn't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell them and cause</font>

879
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,380
even more trouble for your company so

880
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,390
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's really clear what</font>

881
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:08,109
those triggering events are in your plan

882
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:09,640
for contacting these people I'm skipping

883
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,470
over prepared statements because we

884
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:14,770
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> responses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

your regular plan which you should have

have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> special data breach plan it is</font>

893
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,200
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your regular plan already</font>

894
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,089
covers the kinds of things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

continuity plan but the kinds of things

899
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:50,410
that you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do is figure</font>

out how to keep your company running

901
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:54,098
while you're taking the steps to

902
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:57,669
quarantine evident our quarantine

903

affected systems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain evidence</font>

904
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:03,760
not destroy evidence so if your regular

905
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:06,310
plan doesn't already address that make

906
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,930
sure that you have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific in</font>

907
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:11,950
your data breach plan about what you're

908
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:15,009
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do then there's a few things</font>

909
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:18,549
the plan just doesn't cover because it

910
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:21,430
shouldn't these are the things that are

911
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:22,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">legal actions that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might face after</font>

912
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:25,060
a breach and these are the parts that

913
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:28,720
are why it's so important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you not</font>

914
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:31,869
inadvertently destroy evidence and that

915
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">you keep good records while you are</font>

916
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:37,599
addressing the data breach you might

917
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:41,380
face regulator actions if you're in a

918
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,809
regulated industry the Attorney General

919
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:46,180
may take enforcement action against<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

920
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:48,730
for the breach after you inform them

921
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,710
that you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the breach you have to tell</font>

922
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:53,920
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> subject to fines</font>

923
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:56,680
after that you may face class action

924
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,660
lawsuits that one is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

925
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,519
the easiest one to deal with because you

926
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:03,308
can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have something in your customer</font>

927
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:05,379
agreement that says you can't do a class

928
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:07,720
action lawsuit everything is subject to

929
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,819
individual arbitration but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

930
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,038
in there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be subject to a class</font>

931
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:13,660
action lawsuit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the science can</font>

932
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:16,690
come from either the regulators or the

933
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:18,879
state attorneys general so the things I

934
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:23,230
want you to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

935
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,789
presentation it will happen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you you</font>

936
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:28,390
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to deal with this at some</font>

937
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:33,519
point of your career when it does don't

938
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:36,788
panic if you don't have a plan go back

939
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:39,720
to work and make one on Monday gather

940

942

will work<font color="#E5E5E5"> go practice it on monday</font>

945
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:57,720
schedule a drill or figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do an unscheduled room</font>

947
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,999
and the last thing is you can't do this

948
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:06,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">on your own does all those departments</font>

949
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:10,480
need to be involved for a reason so

950
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:12,999
don't try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on your own use your</font>

951
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,019
internal and external resources they are

952
00:45:12,999 --> 00:45:20,069
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a reason and now does anyone</font>

953
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:20,069
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any questions</font>

954
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:44,559
cremation all the questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

955
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:44,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">personal information</font>

956

<font color="#CCCCCC">the state God's the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running to</font>

957
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:03,109
quality requirements by state where they

958
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:07,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically say you not have more or</font>

959
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:19,589
10,000 more in order to constitute a

960
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:22,828
breach George<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so um there's usually</font>

961
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:24,990
not a requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't think I've</font>

962
00:46:22,829 --> 00:46:29,339
ever seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> says it's not a</font>

963
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:32,310
breach if you know you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than 50</font>

964
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:35,578
people affected what it's going to say

965
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:38,700
though is you have to notify the

966
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:41,460
individuals<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are affected but where</font>

967
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:43,169
you're going to have more things kick in

968
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,940
is like maybe you don't have to tell the

969
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:48,359
Attorney General until there are 500

970
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:50,940
residents of the state affected maybe

971
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:54,060
there's a necessity for a public

972
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:56,430
announcement to the media if you have

973
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:59,190
more than 500 individuals in the state

974
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:01,348
affected but you are you know it's still

975
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:05,300
abrasion you have to tell the person who

976
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:10,170
was affected if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some kind of</font>

977
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:12,000
breach so I've actually worked on a

978
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,619
breach where there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single person</font>

979
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,349
affected and it wasn't anything

980
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:18,660
nefarious it was just people had really

981
00:47:16,349 --> 00:47:22,710
stupid passwords and someone got into

982
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:25,078
the wrong persons account and could see

983
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:27,900
their social security<font color="#CCCCCC"> number from there</font>

984
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:30,390
which if you can avoid it to still

985
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:32,550
collect those if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is any way that</font>

986
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,410
you your company can avoid having social

987
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:38,460
security numbers it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really better not</font>

988
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:40,649
to have them anyway that one individual

989
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:44,550
had to be informed had to go through the

990
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:46,800
whole process but there wasn't you know

991
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:48,150
it was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> attorney general notification</font>

992
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,950
because it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one person and it</font>

993
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:51,950
wasn't you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary breach</font>

994
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:27,369
but some conversations of whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

995
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:31,029
citrus park they did a moment that your

996
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:34,619
forensics teams government a loss or

997
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:37,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">loved it a lot eight months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago actually</font>

998
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:57,369
when I thought the work you can

999
00:48:37,869 --> 00:49:00,070
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> average so it's generally from</font>

1000
00:48:57,369 --> 00:49:04,500
the time of detection you can't tell

1001
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:04,500
people what you don't know about so

1009
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,720
another thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should always look for</font>

1010
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:45,049
an attorney is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a referral to</font>

1011
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:47,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that person if you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got people you</font>

1012
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:50,690
trust who also trust the attorney that's

1013
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:52,790
a good attorney to go to you want to

1014
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:54,980
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> someone who is going to be</font>

1015
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:57,050
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> when the breach happens you</font>

1016
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,609
know if you need to call them at two in

1017
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:01,820
the morning milk they need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1018
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:04,279
at two in the morning hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1019
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:11,510
never happens for all involved but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1020
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:12,950
could and now that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main thing is</font>

1021
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that they need to know what they're</font>

1022
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:16,819
doing if they if they start<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

1023
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:19,069
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh we're only going to comply with</font>

1024
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:39,190
the laws of Iowa cuz you're in Iowa walk

1025
00:50:19,069 --> 00:50:41,420
out the door so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

1026
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:44,180
basically how do you decide whose laws

1027
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:47,750
apply and all of these data<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach laws</font>

1028
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:50,359
apply based on where the residency is of

1029
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:52,910
the person affected so you might be

1030
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:55,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">organized in Delaware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and operating in</font>

1031
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:57,170
Iowa and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have offices in Massachusetts</font>

1032
00:50:55,339 --> 00:50:59,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">and none</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that matters because if the</font>

1033
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:02,410
person affected is in Alaska you're

1034
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:02,410
following Alaska's law

1035
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:13,360
and generally the international laws are

1036
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:16,209
also based on the residents<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1037
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,250
person affected but they're less

1038
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:20,590
concerned with data breach than they are

1039
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:50,790
with making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure things stay private in</font>

1040
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:54,510
the first place as a general rule yep so

1041
00:51:50,790 --> 00:52:00,430
when we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at that definition</font>

1042
00:51:54,510 --> 00:52:04,030
way back the general definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

1043
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:06,009
data breach okay I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go all</font>

1044
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:09,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way back fence</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

1045
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:13,510
general definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a data breach is</font>

1046
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:16,000
unauthorized access it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

1047
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:18,430
whether the unauthorized access is by

1048
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,760
somebody you know Russian hackers or

1049
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:25,690
because someone sent the attachment<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1050
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:28,060
the wrong person it is unauthorized

1051
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:30,100
access now one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ways that you can</font>

1052
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:32,350
prevent that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're emailing the</font>

1053
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:36,120
kinds of sensitive information that

1054
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:40,509
might trigger a data breach notification

1055
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:43,779
is to encrypt the attachment and send

1056
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:46,630
the password separately right because

1057
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:53,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">then they have the information but not</font>

1058
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:56,070
the key right just to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1059
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions</font>

1060
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:03,859
all right well then you have a short

1061
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:03,859
break before the next person I think

1062
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:10,319
[Applause]
