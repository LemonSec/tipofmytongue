anyone see the laptop I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't prove any</font>

2
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,160
I apologize I didn't realize that was a

3
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,210
requirement to speak this week so we're

4
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,010
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about vulnerability</font>

5
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,440
scanning integration we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking a</font>

6
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:57,290
slightly different approach more<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

7
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,480
call it the poor man's version there's

8
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,550
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> chickens there's no metasploit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote</font>

9
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">licenses all these things the idea is</font>

10
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,259
let's go open source let's use the tools

11
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,140
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are out there and combined they are</font>

12
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,520
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> as powerful as a lot of the</font>

13
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,470
professional versions that are out there

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,270
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and we're not really</font>

15
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,470
going down the penetration<font color="#CCCCCC"> tester out</font>

16
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">either how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you out there looked</font>

17
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,770
at break things and though the Senate

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,810
reports out to clients and drop them off

19
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:25,310
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their desks and a laugh and walk away</font>

20
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:28,009
right we're on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the roof fee we like to</font>

21
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,080
break stuff but we're also going down

22
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:32,770
the path in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this topic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what if we</font>

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,360
actually helped our development teams

24
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,850
avoid these things before they push them

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,360
to approach would it make our lives a

26
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,038
little bit easier who's broken app so

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,500
that it took them a week to write the

28
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:47,659
report how nice would it we'd only have

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten issues of the report instead of 35</font>

30
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">well the screenshot so those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,650
types of things were thinking of and

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do with most of my free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time when</font>

33
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:00,740
I'm not working I do some teaching with

in jail my email address is out up here

43
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,480
on the slide will show it again at the

44
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,370
end if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have interests we have some</font>

45
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides later hoping to invoke some</font>

46
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,010
participation from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community go</font>

47
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,010
ahead

48
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,410
my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Harry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cure I work with a</font>

50
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:49,010
stands there and who love the big stuff

51
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,589
my emails up here so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

52
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:56,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">enable feel free to reach out I don't</font>

53
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:58,310
know the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll make up so our</font>

54
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,990
agenda we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about our</font>

55
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,460
problem I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of mentioned this</font>

56
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,320
already we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through what</font>

57
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,180
our requirements are for this scanning

58
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,250
framework will talk about the solution

59
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:11,020
aaron has a fun demo he put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

60
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:14,930
then you can ask all these fun questions

61
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:17,420
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a percentage up here 21.6</font>

62
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,420
percent this is not been released yet

63
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,280
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with sands I have this a</font>

64
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,200
little bit before<font color="#CCCCCC"> my web cast when I</font>

65
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,300
officially announced it in a month this

66
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,010
is the percentage of development teams

67
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,920
that are responsible for their own

68
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,600
security testing based on the survey

69
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:38,149
that we had five or<font color="#CCCCCC"> six hundred people</font>

70
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:42,320
answer over the past three<font color="#CCCCCC"> months got</font>

71
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:46,250
one too so let's pick on you right do

72
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:50,510
you do your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own security testing stuff</font>

73
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:54,820
look somewhat that's better than no yeah

74
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,820
yes that's so you are in the minority

75
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:02,720
yes 23<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes good but you're at a security</font>

76
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,149
conference so it kind of leads me to

77
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,590
believe that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a little bit more</font>

78
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">about why these things are important</font>

79
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,030
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the people that are writing</font>

80
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,600
code in our developer community I'm just

81
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:18,048
<font color="#E5E5E5">guessing so what are the excuses for not</font>

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,829
doing this number one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard all the</font>

83
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:25,219
time security is not my job that's the

84
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:28,010
security teams job and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard this</font>

85
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,180
before how many view delivery to report

86
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,330
to a dev team is that while you're doing

87
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,330
that

88
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,420
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a talking to quick q a group</font>

89
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">here in Des Moines last week and try to</font>

90
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,750
teach him how to do social security

91
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,929
testing so it's not their job either

92
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:48,630
according to the group that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked so</font>

93
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:53,160
whose job is it everybody is everyone's

94
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:57,030
job come on I know a job excuse number

95
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,220
two I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have deployments</font>

96
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me I have features i need to add and</font>

97
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,160
they make my company money so i have to

98
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,100
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have time for security</font>

99
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,300
that's excuse number two what happens if

100
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,590
you get for each how much money<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

101
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,420
going to cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> you more than missing a</font>

102
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,000
deadline will say that much depending on

103
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data and number three and this is</font>

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,260
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite one where the dev team</font>

105
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,480
actually says eric i love this scanner

106
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,550
and they're just telling me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so i'll</font>

107
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,470
stop asking them about their not

108
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:33,450
actually using it so it's good this

109
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:35,220
morning yeah that fortifies installed on

110
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,610
their machine so that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font>

111
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,760
secure that's good so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

112
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,890
excuses I've run into and then we have

113
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,070
our friend at Microsoft does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

114
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,450
remember when this announcement came out

115
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,820
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty powerful coming from one of</font>

116
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the biggest companies the CEO</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of one of</font>

117
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:56,760
the biggest companies in the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

118
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,380
this was back in biking on the year when

119
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,180
they really hit a low point security in

120
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,130
Windows is just so full of issues we

121
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,080
started talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what's the next</font>

122
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,180
step and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he says this email out to the</font>

123
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,070
entire company and says when we face a

124
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,220
choice between adding features in

125
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:14,520
security from now on we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose</font>

126
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:19,200
security have you ever received the

127
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,240
communication line pretty solid though

128
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,770
right that's direction from the top

129
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,350
level going<font color="#E5E5E5"> down do you think the</font>

130
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,900
development teams at that point found

131
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,240
time to do security testing I would say

132
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty effective so</font>

133
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,650
there's always this method but the

134
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,909
problem is not everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this so</font>

135
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,880
that's our issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were</font>

136
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:43,110
dissolve and then we have our questions

137
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assume that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I now believe</font>

138
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,210
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be doing by security test and</font>

139
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,500
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just getting started and lots of</font>

140
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,549
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this room where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is security</font>

141
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,470
conference we know this information but

142
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,360
one problem i find in our industry is

143
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,450
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very eager to help other</font>

144
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,370
people learn about we know this super

145
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,440
secret method to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know it</font>

146
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,960
never nobody else does and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

147
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,219
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do because i'm on the</font>

148
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,630
security team I can come<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to your</font>

149
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,340
desk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll check this out yeah</font>

150
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,219
otherwise I wouldn't see that SNL skit

151
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,979
move and they put the type on the

152
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,450
keyboard move right so we need to tell

153
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">them what type of scans they should run</font>

154
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:26,430
showing how to do it it makes our life

155
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:28,530
is here and then most<font color="#E5E5E5"> importantly the</font>

156
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:32,280
third one is what the hell do the

157
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:36,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">results mean cross-site scripting what</font>

158
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,179
is that so we have to train everyone on

159
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,810
the team uses securities everyone's job

160
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,220
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're trying to</font>

161
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,470
accomplish we want to get these results

162
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">down in front of the development teams</font>

163
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:49,230
so they can fix the problem before<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

164
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:52,830
actually gets hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what another</font>

165
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:54,810
constant right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay those are the common</font>

166
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,490
questions we see so when we sat down and

167
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">said let's try to think of something</font>

168
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,230
something simple that we can do it'll be

169
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,060
a framework will call it for now we have

170
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,300
a slide later where you can all vote on

171
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:11,790
the name for this thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what should</font>

172
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:14,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have it do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we need some security</font>

173
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:17,160
tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and they should probably be</font>

174
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:19,349
free because well if we're small shops

175
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:23,040
then we don't have money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend 20k in</font>

176
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:24,990
a fortified license or 25k on all out of

177
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,270
these commercial scanners so let's start

178
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,880
with the basics let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that ssl is a</font>

179
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,849
look at our

180
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">cell config Nessus does cost a little</font>

181
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:37,060
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money but it's reasonably</font>

182
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:39,039
inexpensive in max free<font color="#CCCCCC"> findbugs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nikto w</font>

183
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:42,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">three AF skip fish we've got all sorts</font>

184
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,319
of these scanners that all have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> API</font>

185
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,770
capabilities that we can run against our

186
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:53,710
sites and try to gather some preliminary

187
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:55,720
findings that's step one so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

188
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,520
you went out you dropped 25 grand on the

189
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,410
scanner you should be able to add in

190
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:04,030
your solution right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

191
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:08,469
run it every time you check<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so new</font>

192
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:10,300
plugins scalability is important and

193
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,040
then the benefits we're scanning as

194
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:23,620
things are being pushed out to the test

195
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:25,390
environment now well if you got a few

196
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,000
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> tasks let's go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and do it</font>

197
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:31,060
employers s website let's run up all

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,680
these scanners that gets it let's turn

199
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,579
around and bring back a list of all the

200
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,280
issue to defend the cosmos anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

201
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:44,800
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CPUs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> design-time 13 cents</font>

202
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:49,510
for the power the whole turkey dinner I

203
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,620
choose attorneys made<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 second</font>

204
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,050
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a consistent and repeatable</font>

205
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,000
process because we fix everything the

206
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">first time what happens if we do it</font>

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,190
differently the neck

208
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,320
time around so we need to know what the

209
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,420
scan results come up as the first time

210
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,340
you add if we can see the next time

211
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">around make this a type II derivative</font>

212
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,870
process similar to our agile and DevOps

213
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,220
movements we're trying to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

214
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,530
the speed of development because it's

215
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,770
impossible doing things the way that we

216
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,510
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> are 10 hour a bullet forces to</font>

217
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,730
release more secure co2 production right

218
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:21,250
there are security issues before it goes

219
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,080
to QA the chances of a security issue

220
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,730
before goes in production or when

221
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,290
analyzed and we're fixing them in the

222
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,420
beginning where it's cheap the

223
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,610
developers writing the code to have the

224
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:39,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">rate secure code as much less expensive</font>

225
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:43,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they go an entire so when we come up</font>

226
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:45,520
with what about 12 30 this morning I

227
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,990
decided that we can finally lay it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a</font>

228
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,530
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so here's where we're going</font>

229
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:52,720
to start we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the name we're not</font>

230
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,250
quite sure on this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will let you</font>

231
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,370
all decide well come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a name</font>

232
00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:02,590
later it's less important just like our

233
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,199
last tools your header insertion<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool</font>

234
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:12,970
very good luck

235
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:14,679
we use module instead so it was Jim the

236
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,109
gold near real-time feedback to

237
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,999
development teams so what if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

238
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,289
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can push a button and what if</font>

239
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:22,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was integrated in their build cycle</font>

240
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:24,759
you know something they had to do as

241
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:28,348
code was being moved out from test the

242
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,349
UA to the prod all those types of things

243
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:36,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">and see if there's anything that's nasty</font>

244
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:38,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">before I go yep the other thing we</font>

245
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:40,628
wanted to be repeatable inconsistent

246
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:42,069
right everybody remember all the red

247
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:46,229
line answers for all the open source

248
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:49,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">tools that use SSL r dash y dash B dash</font>

249
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:52,389
RT capital<font color="#CCCCCC"> D and hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your mouth right</font>

250
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:54,879
turn around three circles okay exactly

251
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:59,019
so we wanted to be automated let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

252
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:00,939
forget all that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks scared so</font>

253
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,589
our server side well of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we're in</font>

254
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:05,799
a rest world so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a REST API</font>

255
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:07,359
and what if we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest api had</font>

256
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,999
actually returned some information back

257
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:12,669
to us in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same format regardless of</font>

258
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:14,349
whatever tool we call being called<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

259
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:17,109
different ones and if they are all

260
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:18,970
speaking the same predefined format then

261
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:20,769
we can start to parse these built some

262
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,599
rules around them on the client side and

263
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:24,609
guess what we can display that to

264
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:27,069
whoever it is they call to service so

265
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:28,449
that's what we wanted to start with the

266
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:31,149
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask you to all</font>

267
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:33,189
scans<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the same server anybody in an</font>

268
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,579
environment where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I he is</font>

269
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:35,579
writing this

270
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,459
price<font color="#E5E5E5"> or we're going to do a scan on</font>

271
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,559
every web server they want to know where

272
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,689
it's coming closely rules in place to

273
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,189
the firewall right same kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

274
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:48,559
wanna make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that everything lives a</font>

275
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:51,889
safe place are these we know where he's

276
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming from then our client site is the</font>

277
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:56,059
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting because this is really</font>

278
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:58,309
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use I wrote a python</font>

279
00:12:56,059 --> 00:13:00,889
client last night to pull it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> proof</font>

280
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:03,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concept this could easily be written</font>

281
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:04,999
in whatever language you want and we'll

282
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:07,490
talk about some ideas we have for this

283
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:09,559
here in a little bit the idea is let's

284
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:12,470
execute our server side code we retrieve

285
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:19,809
and display the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty simple</font>

286
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:19,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">constant oh yeah after your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big dope</font>

287
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:31,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we have quite simply is</font>

288
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:36,240
somewhere here you probably wanna see it

289
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,819
too huh and so you get for using<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font>

290
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">go knock it out let's start your hating</font>

291
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:46,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wrote in Java so you could use it on</font>

292
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:49,880
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac you know how I hate you alright</font>

293
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:54,510
so our first initial thought of this was

294
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:56,040
let's automate Burke right we use burp

295
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,230
all the time no we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started with Bert</font>

296
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,459
this whole thing started with burp and

297
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,150
we said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we can write a burp</font>

298
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">plug-in that would have x yeah easy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

299
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,150
me to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ready to lips I'm so sorry</font>

300
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,360
good thing you don't speak freely I know

301
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,709
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're going to automate where</font>

302
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,740
we're going to write a plug-in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

303
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:15,510
would have implement export<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

304
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,910
stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying all those words just insert</font>

305
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:20,040
your own word that works there an API

306
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,140
that would allow us to automate burp go

307
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,240
in and set it and have it automatically

308
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,920
spiderus aight have it automatically do

309
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,660
some of the base attacks right burps<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

310
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,089
great tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 bucks a year can't beat</font>

311
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,459
it turns out as that does all that for

312
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:37,230
free it's got a built-in rest api right

313
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:42,000
so if i just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to my local port against</font>

314
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:44,040
zap whatever the proxy is running on it

315
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,260
automatically has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> REST API I can go to</font>

316
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,500
the local API and I can do things like

317
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:53,240
spy during a site i can come down<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

318
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:56,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and i can say scan a URL and i can say</font>

319
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:01,380
open sea surface EDD exploit on that

320
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:08,010
scan it and down here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in zap it's</font>

321
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:09,550
actually theoretically nice now needed

322
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:15,410
on that it

323
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:21,500
oh is it done it I don't know that's

324
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:23,029
what he<font color="#CCCCCC"> said anyway finding how to run</font>

325
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,950
the tool you could actually run it from

326
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:26,420
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end see ya it's not repeatable and</font>

327
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,940
consistent because I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even type the</font>

328
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,490
stupid thing so what we decided let's

329
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:35,899
just put a server in front of that let's

330
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:38,269
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going to have a set of</font>

331
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:41,300
processes right and all we're going to

332
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:44,149
do a REST API that we can do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

333
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,329
spider site and when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> say to spider the</font>

334
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:51,350
site I want you to fire up zap go to a

335
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:53,660
website look up the information run the

336
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Accu scan against it find any of the</font>

337
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,069
alerts and bring them back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me right</font>

338
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:03,740
six steps that I can automate because of

339
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:05,600
that zap API so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see we're</font>

340
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,140
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to list all those out so we just</font>

341
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,350
call process / list if we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

342
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,600
out what they do we can get the detail

343
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,520
again it just comes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and JSON so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

344
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,380
can run it anyway I want format it turn

345
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:22,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and play with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it this one uses is</font>

346
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:27,740
that proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run a spider on it and</font>

347
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:31,490
then if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to scan it we</font>

348
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:34,370
can just it isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> done that we can just</font>

349
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to process and that calls ask</font>

350
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,700
and it's a really simple interface on

351
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the inside I'll let this run for a</font>

352
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,600
second because it takes a minute to

353
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:44,240
spider than<font color="#CCCCCC"> site but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see that</font>

354
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's already gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into zap it's found</font>

355
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,240
that site it started spider in it and

356
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,890
it's working on the active scanning so

357
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,380
in the code itself it's really simple

358
00:16:51,890 --> 00:17:00,470
all you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need is a dot scan method on</font>

359
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:05,780
your object so in here on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasp code</font>

360
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:10,069
all we do is stand up one of their

361
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:12,290
client api's tell it to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the data</font>

362
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,720
get the alerts whatever to help to do an

363
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,379
active

364
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,919
scan<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then bring back the data for us</font>

365
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,409
and what we end up with is this neat

366
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,630
little list of alerts coming out of the

367
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:27,240
active scans which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to match our</font>

368
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:33,570
list over here here's all the 36 things

369
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:37,620
that it found which is all great if you

370
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:39,720
like to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON anybody here got JSON</font>

371
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,760
eyes<font color="#E5E5E5"> after about two minutes all the</font>

372
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,159
squigglies become squares become Martian

373
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,780
reading and I can't understand anything

374
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:48,240
kind of i am so Eric was nice enough to

375
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,780
run it right a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little person for us and</font>

376
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:56,250
it's just a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> quick stand up the</font>

377
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:59,520
server hit our<font color="#CCCCCC"> breasts server call the</font>

378
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,860
SSL eyes client against the domain call

379
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,539
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zap spider against the domain and</font>

380
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:08,809
then put it all in a neat little<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTML</font>

381
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:08,809
format so if i run that<font color="#CCCCCC"> python script</font>

382
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,780
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come by it's going to run</font>

383
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,179
those pull those same<font color="#E5E5E5"> json objects bring</font>

384
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:21,059
them back and throw them out to an HTML

385
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:23,220
file so now you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL eyes is done</font>

386
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,080
one of the things we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL</font>

387
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,169
eyes client anybody here read SSL eyes

388
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,000
all the time do you do the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

389
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:32,789
over and over and over you look at an

390
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">SSL eyes report you look oh look 112</font>

391
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:38,250
bits site that look I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font>

392
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,200
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using des site that I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

393
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,409
through using<font color="#CCCCCC"> rc4 site that they're</font>

394
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,750
using SSL v1 v2 v3 doesn't matter site

395
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:48,380
that right it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing over and</font>

396
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:52,380
over and over well why not automate that

397
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:54,740
so if you look over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the SSL eyes</font>

398
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,740
code

399
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:20,940
you're going to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> some basic rules if</font>

400
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,199
you find the index of 112 we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

401
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,270
there's a bit problem so we're going to

402
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,480
create an alert for that and what we end

403
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:30,720
up with on the back end then on a client

404
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,810
system we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can pull up the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> results of</font>

405
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:38,190
this tool and you're going to see ssl

406
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:41,159
ice found problems right found an RCA

407
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">shaw rc4 shop i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> death issues more rc4</font>

408
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,540
and death issues right and then we have

409
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,870
all the alerts that came out of spider

410
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,370
saying could we filter those down decide

411
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:54,419
which ones are right those kinds of

412
00:19:50,370 --> 00:20:00,110
things yeah sure so now we've got all

413
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:00,110
this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can pull and</font>

414
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:07,200
automate and take action on if we wanted

415
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:11,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to turn around use that client and</font>

416
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,040
instead push it out to TFS create bugs

417
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,810
for everything that we found difficult

418
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lines of code right we</font>

419
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:20,100
want to do the same thing with JIRA or

420
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,480
any of the other ticketing systems

421
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,129
there's already libraries out there for

422
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,020
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all that stuff so let's use</font>

423
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">these automated sources let's push them</font>

424
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,940
through and we can add any tool we want

425
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:32,190
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to do is add in another</font>

426
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,780

00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:43,770
results into a format that we can

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:47,070
understand over here so any questions

so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah credential pre configuration</font>

449
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,970
will be big for those types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sites</font>

you'll have to measure your spiders

accurate give the tool what it needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

452
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,020
get in there and actually give you some

00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:24,889
accurate results and flow paths through

No

456
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:38,489
yes it's free awesome project and

457
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:38,490
honestly a lot of the more reliable

458
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:21,800

this job let's push that stuff through

461
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:45,700
to find out hey what can I outrace like

462
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:45,700
for everything easier we want to say yes

463
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:52,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best part for your question is in</font>

00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:56,149
spider that's not working we know it's

466
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,620
not quite reliable we were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoints into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the app and</font>

468
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,299
make sure the scan actually hits all of

00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:03,860
those requests if you pre cash or

470
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:05,840
pre-configured then we know the scanner

471
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,030
is testing what it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test we only</font>

472
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,129
have two interative we update it as we

473
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:15,649
allow you can points in our app things

477
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,949
as you can get with that

478
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,830
come on back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your false positives and</font>

479
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,630
there's two opportunities for false

480
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:56,330
positive removal here we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the</font>

481
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:57,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">server side and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that parsing code we</font>

482
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:00,050
can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we know these are bad and</font>

483
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,490
remove them<font color="#E5E5E5"> if for your environment even</font>

484
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:05,060
on the client side that's another

485
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:06,710
opportunity to strip those out before

486
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,399
you actually display that report out to

487
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,400
your users as well

488
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,539
so all kinds of stuff

489
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:29,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">so take your egg put it in a gradual</font>

490
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:31,710
concept kind of works or useless basics

491

Oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> sans maybe put this in here there's</font>

497
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:04,220

501
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:14,720
entire curriculum dedicated to that and

502
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:17,748
that was better we didn't bring beer

503
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:22,460
either what we do that with you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

504
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:24,230
say it forget the candy so plenty of

505
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:32,240
time for questions comments does anyone

506
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:34,429
have a good name<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I no chance think</font>

507
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,460
about it your backyard

508
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:41,629
take a card<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be glad to take off</font>

509
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:43,749
the dish in questions we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

510
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:43,748
it

511
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,270
sure

512
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,399
you can throw out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these scanners</font>

513
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,590
down they all have some of those so

514
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,360
these are again configuration things say

515
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,730
we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the point where we can release</font>

516
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,100
this as a linux distribution for example

517
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can install it down in here maybe in</font>

518
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,389
a network girl<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> absurd Floyd we'd</font>

519
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,670
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're less configures that to</font>

520
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,380
throttle back or work for throttle<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

521
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,030
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know we've all church</font>

522
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,070
laughs and all those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> before on</font>

523
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:23,240
accident got ourselves in trouble

524
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:26,080
ourselves logged out on accident so<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

525
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,280
accident that's that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it protects</font>

526
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,230
so yeah those are all things to keep in

527
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,810
mind and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do have those things in</font>

528
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:35,030
place we probably disabling in our test

529
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,800
environments for this particular purpose

530
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,990
because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really testing the</font>

531
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,730
application very well either if we do

532
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that right we're testing a laugh not our</font>

533
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:46,190
code at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> so great observation</font>

534
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,899
hey there's all sorts of hurdles and

535
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,250
we'll have to address those when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font>

536
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,650
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's why we're hoping</font>

537
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,270
everyone will jump on board and help

538
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:55,040
assemble this project because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

539
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">be pretty cool I did like the Jenkins</font>

540
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,070
idea from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous talk because</font>

541
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:00,889
that'd be way to schedule these out and

542
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,179
launch them from a more foundational

543
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:11,360
scheduling tool so that could be

544
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:15,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">something also was there anything before</font>

545
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">alpha or every outbreak</font>

546
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,450
do they

547
00:30:51,190 --> 00:31:00,120
also there's multiple ways to do it the

548
00:30:55,060 --> 00:31:00,120
schedule but finally

549
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:10,340
the future that I'll go to next<font color="#E5E5E5"> mortise</font>

550
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:12,230
to go down the developer path as I want

551
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,480
to plug in for visual studio or eclipse

552
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,760
or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ve development teams are</font>

553
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,100
using and I want a big green or red

554
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,080
button in there that says in my hat

555
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,750
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I deployed and I want those</font>

556
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,820
results immediately fed<font color="#E5E5E5"> right back to</font>

557
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,390
the developer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just checked in a</font>

00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,389
release code

559
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,120
yo

560
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:06,390
yeah because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you but</font>

561
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,100
I'm sick and tired<font color="#CCCCCC"> to finding people</font>

injection issues and applications where

563

you could have just showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to up</font>

564
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,960
front and got rid of it six months
