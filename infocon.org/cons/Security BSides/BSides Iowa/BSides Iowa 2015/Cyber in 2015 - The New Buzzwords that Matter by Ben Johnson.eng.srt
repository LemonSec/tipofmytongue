matter we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all probably are sick of</font>

5
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,019

together for this presentation so I

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,289
really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> feedback I'm excited about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it but it is the first time so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

23
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:33,429
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always tweaks that kind of stuff</font>

24
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:35,259
so today I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go over uh you</font>

26
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:39,909
away right I do work for a vendor this

27
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,929
is absolutely not a vendor pitch so

28
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:42,459
we're going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through goals real</font>

29
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:45,369
quick i'll tell you a little bit about

30
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:46,450
my background and maybe you know why you

31
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:47,910
shouldn't just you know run away

32
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,110
screaming saying this guy's an idiot

33
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:55,179
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those buzzwords and</font>

34
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:56,560
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> takeaways so the goals I want this</font>

35
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:58,239
to be interact with if you have

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,959
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contribute something to ask</font>

37
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:04,209
please do<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and I also want you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

38
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:06,580
some contemplation some thinking how in

39
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:07,840
this apply in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment some of</font>

40
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,609
the things I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

41
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,730
probably years of years ahead of where

42
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,599
your companies are or at least you know

43
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,940
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to be really hard</font>

44
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,619
logistically to get there I hope not but

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,120
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of what I do is talk to</font>

46
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">companies and I know it's a hard problem</font>

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,610
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know funding get IT on board</font>

48
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:27,459
that kind of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so my background I</font>

49
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,440
started at NSA on the left here NSA and

50
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,629
man tag after going to say I did some

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,510
work for multiple three-letter agencies

52
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:35,329
and Department of Defense that's why I

53
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to</font>

54
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">in text so I could do more than just NSA</font>

55
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,929
I put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in red because I was really</font>

56
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,540
doing offensive things stuff that I

57
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:47,480
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> free but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I happen to</font>

58
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,760
get paid for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by offense I mean</font>

59
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,940
use your imagination but stuff that took

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,790
executive orders to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do now</font>

61
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,650
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it requires high levels of</font>

62
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,570
approval you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't really do that in the</font>

63
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,810
commercial world so as I started moving

64
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,400
through my career in to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kairos um you</font>

65
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,010
know we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing more defensive</font>

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,380
things rying to stop foreigners stop bad

67
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,060
guys we came up with the idea for carbon

68
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,380
black formed that went through the whole

69
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,330
roller coaster of building a startup

70
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,040
getting funding and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know</font>

71
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,350
selling our<font color="#CCCCCC"> company's a bit and now at</font>

74
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,450
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> act like a CTO I travel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around a lot</font>

75
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,630
i did 40,000 miles in the first three

76
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:32,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">months so i'm on a lot of planes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i got</font>

77
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,740
platinum status already but I meet with

00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,590
high-tech companies every vertical

80
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:43,760
Energy Finance Silicon Valley I<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend a</font>

81
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:46,100
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time out there so I hope you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

82

83
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,420
of really cool companies I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to UC</font>

00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we're doing a good job did anyone</font>

91
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,400
think we're winning how about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

92
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:13,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on we're on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,900
page so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing of</font>

94
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,060
you know cyber resiliency being able to

95
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,478
withstand an attack you're basically

96
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:23,000
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a punch and keep going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um you</font>

97
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,860
know a lot of problems are also when

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,900
we're doing monitoring when we're doing

99
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,150
incident response<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing cyber</font>

100
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,650
defense there's a lot of thinking like I

101
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,200
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or I think this</font>

102
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">is malicious but not a lot of knowing so</font>

103
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,740
that's another problem we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

104
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:42,140
much data you know alert fatigue just

105
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,090
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know millions of alerts millions of</font>

106
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,820
events that kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then how</font>

107
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,219
effective are we as humans security is

108
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,210
about human

109
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,640
detecting and responding to breaches

110
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,109
with tools to support you right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

111
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,640
about technology doing all the work it's

112
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,990
about humans doing work and hopefully

113
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,940
being more effective because of

114
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:02,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology so it's something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

115
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,640
about so the first buzzword and this is

116
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,610
actually multiple words right but risk

117
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:14,060
hunting so is anyone here doing threat

118
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:15,140
hunting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little so it's</font>

119
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,660
right hunting is a little bit more

120
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,190
advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you're not just you know</font>

121
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,210
responding to alerts you're not just

122
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,320
looking at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sim you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

123
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:25,460
scanning for<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOC's you're actually</font>

124
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,320
mining data actually hunting but my sort

125
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,380
of passion here is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to move beyond</font>

126
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:34,760
threats we got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move to risk risk is a</font>

127
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:37,250
higher level concept and friends right

128
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,930
risk is actually threat plus you know

129
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,700
what's vulnerable what assets do you

130
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:45,950
have what are your countermeasures we

131
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:47,840
got a thing about risk so you know when

132
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,289
we're too focused on compromise and

133
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,640
things like indicators have compromised

134
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,800
you know we typically aren't really

135
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,570
focused on improving our posture we're

136
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,210
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out the fire as fast as</font>

137
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:02,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible trying to clean up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and just get</font>

138
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,590
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the next alert but we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

139
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,320
really focused on where the problems

140
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,539
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be focused on where are the bad</font>

141
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,550
guys now or<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just mass malware that</font>

142
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,200
kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's too hard to</font>

143
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,380
keep up there's too many bad guys and

144
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,030
it's a lot harder to know what bad

145
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,450
behavior looks like then what risky

146
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:22,729
behavior looks like because of intent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

147
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,830
can say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this guy keeps</font>

148
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,710
being the first one in my environment to

149
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,120
hit new domains or to install software

150
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:32,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's I'm going to define him as a</font>

151
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,460
risky user but malicious or you know bad

152
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,200
behavior is much harder to define it's

153
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,180
like credit card companies how do they

154
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,460
detect fraud they don't look for bad

155
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,620
they look for known good like a fuzzy

156
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,180
box and then once you're spending goes

157
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,860
outside that box too far out of your

158
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,169
profile you know they profile all of us

159
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,280
then they call you and they say hey are

160
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:52,490
you actually buying something for a

161
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,099
dollar in Singapore or whatever right so

162
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,280
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that as we're</font>

163
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,400
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> our strategic planning</font>

164
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,388
also our off day to day<font color="#CCCCCC"> operations and</font>

165
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,070
there's this notion you've probably

166
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:05,170
heard it if you read blogs or<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font>

167
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,849
analysts a lot of times with a

firefighter in the cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense world</font>

169
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,020
right something's going on we're trying

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,388
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fix it but now we're trying to move</font>

171
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,789
to the beat pop who is also responding

172
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:18,550
to 911 calls you know cyber incidents

173
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,470
whatever but he's also out looking for

174
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,080
problems getting to know his environment

175
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,490
write anything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> county but we</font>

176
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,229
can't stop there and this where I'm

177
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,750
talking about risk we got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move to a</font>

178
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,710
fire marshal as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire marshal is</font>

179
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,820
going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say you know what this</font>

180
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,919
structure this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to cause</font>

181
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,180
problems or if this thing breaks right

182
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">here it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to collapse enjoys</font>

183
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,910
people think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in your</font>

184
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,409
environment if something gets

185
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,330
compromised some part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

186
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:46,060
some segments if this machine is hit

187
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:47,260
what can have think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk so you</font>

188
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,650
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to give you a few concrete</font>

189
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:53,110
examples here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already mentioned</font>

190
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,429
some of this what users are being the

191
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,169
first to hit a domain you've never seen

192
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,020
before who's opening all these

193
00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:00,549
attachments what happens if someone just

194
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">walks into your company and plugs into</font>

195
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,940
the wall what access do they get a lot

196
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,910
of times the security team doesn't know

197
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,400
and you know we've done back when we did

198
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,930
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> end testing commercial work we</font>

199
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,370
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go set up an interview and</font>

200
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,390
then say we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go the bathroom and</font>

201
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,560
then just plug something in the wall and

202
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,320
say oh I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel well I'm leaving we</font>

203
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,660
literally did that all time do you know

204
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,300
what access we would have maybe maybe

205
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,490
not oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're you know where the</font>

206
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,430
misconfigurations you know there's

207
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,560
plenty even<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a small company there's</font>

208
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,549
plenty but large companies are chaotic

209
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,099
you know organic environments and

210
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:38,650
ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah this dot works but</font>

211
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,030
think about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can an insight or do if</font>

212
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,380
they're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this system or else on this</font>

213
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,809
system or if they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to this</font>

214
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,290
data what can they do that's where you

215
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,219
really have to focus your your attention

216
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,110
because the bad guys will become

217
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,820
insiders they'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> credentials or</font>

218
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,750
they'll land malware you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one</font>

219
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,820
little phishing email and they've

220
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,190
parachuted over your perimeter if you

221
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:01,660
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a printer so you got to think</font>

222
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:05,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that so we have to detect and</font>

223
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:09,430
respond quickly but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get ahead</font>

224
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,800
of the game we can't keep off we don't

225
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,569
want this anymore we don't

226
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,990
bombardment right just getting crushed

227
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:19,030
by bad things and oh by the way a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

228
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,320
companies don't even know probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

229
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,610
guys have seen this like you don't even

230
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,750
know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on cuz you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want the</font>

231
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,220
visibility right so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

232
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,860
getting crushed in it's like you don't

233
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:30,100
even know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're being bombed but</font>

234
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,640
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen so again we</font>

235
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,560
want to be able to conduct risk hunting

236
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,880
that's where we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to so a</font>

237
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,800
couple other buzzwords I'm going to talk

238
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,750
about are trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you there</font>

239
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,859
because how can you conduct for hunting

240
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:50,020
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have time if you're too too</font>

241
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,520
burdened with the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of alerts the</font>

242
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,350
number of fires<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put out false</font>

243
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,970
positive except you could never<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

244
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,080
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something hardly anyone</font>

245
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,490
raise their hand of the threat hunting

246
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,940
and to me that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even advanced as</font>

247
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,500
risk hunting now risk hunting is part of

248
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,710
compliance a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's usually</font>

249
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,660
not a very active ongoing thing you know

250
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:11,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me risk hunting is you can take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

251
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:14,410
person in your environment and they go

252
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,790
and look for a Miss configuration or you

253
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,589
know machine a should not talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

254
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,050
machine be and as soon as they find that

255
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:22,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">you act as if that's the compromise you</font>

256
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,189
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay crap what if someone exploited</font>

257
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,980
this go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an instant response I hope we</font>

258
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:31,120
get there not many companies are doing

259
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:33,010
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> buzzword number two analytics this is</font>

260
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,080
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot buzzword right now it's not</font>

261
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:40,140
necessarily new but it's it's it's much

262
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:42,790
hotter 24 2015 that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was 2014 2013</font>

263
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,590
going to RSA tomorrow for the week I'm

264
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,980
sure every company is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be saying</font>

265
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:49,990
analytics right and analytics there's a

266
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,060
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of definitions for it you probably</font>

267
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,620
have your own thoughts I have my own

268
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,270
definition which isn't necessarily the

269
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,550
same as you but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you'll</font>

270
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:00,189
understand what I'm talking about so

271
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,719
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> analytics lots of things right</font>

272
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,630
like I just said but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me it's</font>

273
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,580
extracting data extracting extracting

274
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,850
value extracting intelligence from data

275
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,020
from relationships along that<font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

276
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,380
right but really when I boil it down

277
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,590
it's about comparing current behavior to

278
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:20,100
historical behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> and comparing car</font>

279
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,840
against other current behavior and you

280
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,700
boil it down even more it's about

281
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">finding things signal versus noise</font>

282
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:30,180
where's the signal in this noise and

283
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,450
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some customers especially</font>

284
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:36,329
the ones that are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have their</font>

285
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,040
stuff together they're actually trying

286
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,600
to figure out what story<font color="#E5E5E5"> does the data</font>

287
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,010
tell where do they have to apply their

288
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
resources where does their budget need

289
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,330
to go where does their strategy and

290
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,470
planning need together what story does

291
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:51,240
your data tell and analytics also that

292
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:56,520
so when you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about analytics and</font>

293
00:11:51,240 --> 00:12:00,150
comparing behavior comparing events if

294
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:02,819
your environment is like this versus

295
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:06,150
this guess which one's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to</font>

296
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">do analytics on not this what's normal</font>

297
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:11,370
where's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your baseline how can you find</font>

298
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:13,560
anomalies how can algorithms pick out

299
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,110
what's normal how can even humans pick

300
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:20,910
out with some and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just in India</font>

301
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:22,410
and experience this<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes um so you've got</font>

302
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think about this you got to work with</font>

305
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,360
segmentation all this simple stuff which

306
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know is not simple in practice because</font>

307
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,990
of merger and acquisitions as new

308
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,330
machines coming online you got to get

309
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the you know ship a product or keep the</font>

keep the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lights on or whatever I</font>

311
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:45,060
understand but you've got to at least

312
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,220
try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get here so to give you a few</font>

313
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,780
examples of what I consider just simple

314
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,910
analytics people might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even call</font>

315
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,350
these analytics but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do are you just</font>

316
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,290
recording every time net dot exe is

317
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:58,410
month or something similar that might be

318
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:01,410
abused by a bad guy and probably not use

319
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:04,459
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> often in house are you watching</font>

320
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:07,230
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell is being used even</font>

321
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:11,160
simple stuff like are you mapping which

322
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:14,010
user logs into which machine why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

323
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,180
only admin on that HR<font color="#E5E5E5"> persons box well</font>

324
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,250
it's probably not the domain admin it's

325
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,010
probably some bad guy and then other

326
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:21,209
stuff too like is it Dropbox that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font>

327
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero</font>

328
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:27,089
or is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unsigned binary running</font>

329
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:27,989
out of a temp directory named XYZ<font color="#E5E5E5"> exe so</font>

330
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:30,029
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

331
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,670
but some of this stuff is really how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

332
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:35,850
catch malicious humans and you know

333
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">malware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too little is just humans and it</font>

334
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,850
comes down to you know visibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

335
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">analysis you've got to be able to see</font>

336
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,230
these kinds of events or this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

337
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:45,389
data before you can start pulling out

338
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,920
anomalies looking for patterns comparing

339
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,509
behavior if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any</font>

340
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,360
visibility if you don't have any data

341
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have nothing to do with analytics</font>

342
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,619
right and so real quick this is a

343
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,259
passion lines a whole separate talk just

344
00:13:55,619 --> 00:14:00,959
on advanced threat hunting but the bad

345
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:04,499
guys truly live off the land and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

346
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean by that well malicious humans</font>

347
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:08,369
especially an especially like

348
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,779
state-sponsored or advanced you know

349
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:12,869
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybercrime mafias that kind of</font>

350
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:14,970
stuff they get credentials<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then what</font>

351
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:17,220
do they do they live off the land they

352
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:21,569
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> FTP they use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell they use</font>

353
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,829
command shell they used robocopy they

354
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,569
use all these tools that are building

355
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:27,149
that's just windows mac and linux other

356
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:28,259
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> unix style systems have tons of</font>

357
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,839
utilities they can do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

358
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:33,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compression you know SCP all this</font>

359
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,299
stuff they don't need to drop malware

360
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:38,639
fit its log in and use signed and

361
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:41,040
Microsoft or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google whatever</font>

362
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,730
binaries that's how they do their job

363
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,610
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there they do it well so they blend</font>

364
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,799
it target everyone still<font color="#E5E5E5"> likes picking</font>

365
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,600
on target you probably can't read this

366
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:56,759
but attackers mostly use general IT

367
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:59,360
tools procedures and protocols seldom

368
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,279
did they use hacker specific tools and

369
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,749
malware now they put up<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM scraper</font>

370
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,029
malware or whatever but it got on all

371
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:07,139
the machines through the the system

372
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:10,049
administrator tools the software

373
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:11,429
distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay install this on all</font>

374
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,929
our point of sale systems and then

375
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:15,449
collect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and then just use FTP</font>

376
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:19,259
to go out it's literally ftp all your

377
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:22,880
very eyes so it's occurring all<font color="#E5E5E5"> tom and</font>

378
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:25,040
analytics right

379
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,810
just show me<font color="#E5E5E5"> where net dot exe is</font>

380
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,390
running and the command line<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font>

381
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,800
this crap that's not useful but then all

382
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,569
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know with a human eye it</font>

383
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,079
just jumps out like hey someone's adding

384
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,880
a user here and someone's not even share

385
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,250
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> just simple recording of things</font>

386
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,920
like net debt exe or other tools like

387
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,770
that you might start finding stuff maybe

388
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,550
insiders of using things or just

389
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,350
mounting shares you don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

390
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,290
should be mounting etc or malicious

391
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,120
humans so analytics again this is this

392
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,089
is really how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think of analytics you</font>

393
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">might have your own definition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buzzword</font>

394
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,660
number three and my favorite and oh by

395
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,860
the way I thought I think analytics is a

396
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,420
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buzz word</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the year I think</font>

397
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,860
orchestrations number two where's

398
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,260
contains i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where that's going</font>

399
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:11,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall but remember we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to use</font>

400
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:13,880
analytics and now orchestration to save

401
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,310
you time so that you can maybe get to

402
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,760
risk hunting or threat hunting so

403
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:24,160
orchestration anyone hear much about

404
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:28,580
orchestration anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing orchestration</font>

405
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,430
awesome so you can also think of it like

406
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,960
automation integration<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the word</font>

407
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,849
orchestration and I think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

408
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,520
catching on<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you have people like</font>

409
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:40,400
DARPA saying look the attackers just

410
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,770
have to find a single fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> defenders</font>

411
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,520
really have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to predict anticipate</font>

412
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:49,100
and deny every flaw so the economics are

413
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,090
not in your favor not in our favor so

414
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,430
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> due</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> automation through</font>

415
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:55,130
computational power that we can

416
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,510
hopefully level the playing field or

417
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe even get ahead although that's</font>

418
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:03,860
that sounds a little crazy right now

419
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:05,660
when we're completely not winning so you

420
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,030
have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these different parts of your</font>

421
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,060
stack you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect you know</font>

422
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:12,829
identity or you know users user accounts

423
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,809
etc you're trying to protect data from

424
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:17,438
teksystems

425
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:20,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">Communications but all this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff is</font>

426
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:24,730
related and all has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work together and</font>

427
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:26,529
to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it another way and I don't know</font>

428
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">about your spending or your stack your</font>

429
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:30,879
security staff but you really need stuff

430
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:33,158
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint on your network you need</font>

431
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:35,980
some form of analytics and you need some

432
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:37,179
threat intelligence buzzword flash so

433
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,570
you need all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff to work together</font>

434
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:42,370
and you have companies there's a bunch

435
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,899
of them now that are coming out this

436
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,830
isn't our company<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you have a bunch</font>

437
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:47,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">of companies that are coming out with</font>

438
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">its kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like sim to point up where</font>

439
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:52,899
it's trying to give you a single pane of

440
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:54,939
glass where it's incorporating all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:57,330
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know detection alerts from</font>

442
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,090
your different products and solutions

443
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,740
but then it's trying to pull in context

444
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,330
when you get that alert and it says hey

445
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">this malicious binary connected to that</font>

446
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,399
IP and that domain is that alert also

447
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:11,350
tell you like when the domain was

448
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:12,758
registered how often<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that IP has</font>

hit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your environment what user</font>

00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,919
is that users is what else has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been seen</font>

452
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:30,789
in my environment related to this are

453
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:39,210
your alert saying that yeah really fails

454
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:41,549
because most these attackers the

455
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:45,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">sophistication they go ahead and they</font>

456
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:48,049
distribute these bombs out there

457
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,600
really clever<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing it the same by air</font>

458
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:53,299
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are switching to multiple types of</font>

460
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:59,860
completely distributed there is no

461
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:04,340
rationale acne easily derive unless I'm

462
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:06,979
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard so those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of modalities</font>

463
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,689
of view only will give you a little

464
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:14,059
hanging fruit type of the Tigers they

465
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:16,429
will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything right so it's it's also</font>

466
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:18,139
it's also about showing what else is

467
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:20,000
occurring in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time frame what else</font>

468
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:22,399
are those machines doing thats related

469
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,169
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree that IPS and stuff change but</font>

470
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:26,239
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times attacks will hit a bunch</font>

471
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:27,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">of boxes at once and they will use the</font>

472
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP at least for that one attack</font>

473
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:36,408
like that day right and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they might</font>

474
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:38,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">change okay so um so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's still all</font>

475
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">about pulling information together when</font>

476
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,840
you're responding to an alert do you

477
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,879
have to go paste your domain and do who

478
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,500
is or things like that having all this

479
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:48,529
information at your fingertips but not

480
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just pulling information</font>

together but being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to</font>

take<font color="#CCCCCC"> action oh this thing's bad and</font>

484
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:59,299
according to multiple sources of thread

485
00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:00,860
and tell ya I'm sure it's bad okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> let</font>

486
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:03,980
me go ban that hash let me turn off<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

487
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,928
switch port let me send off an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

488
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,610
me and automatically enroll that user

489
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:11,389
and fishing training or whatever so

490
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,830
orchestration is really what I'm talking

491
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:14,299
about for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff and you're seeing</font>

492
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,668
especially companies like in Silicon

493
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:19,309
Valley where literally eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of</font>

494
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:23,539
their security team are coders because

495
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:26,149
all these products now have AP is so

496
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:28,460
just put coders to it you still have

497
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:29,389
analysts but put coders to tie all this

498
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,129
stuff together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now you're starting</font>

499
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:32,889
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see companies come out with actual</font>

500
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,759
products it's like a correlation engine

501
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:37,070
right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm talking about with</font>

502
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:39,320
orchestration so you know really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

503
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,908
to unify your products a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font>

504
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,649
different products they might have a

505
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:45,799
connector they might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a vendor</font>

506
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:47,268
full disclosure we provide connectors

507
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:51,769
but you know it's it's one plus one

508
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:53,480
equals two point<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 2.5 when you have an</font>

509
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:55,580
integration but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dream is</font>

510
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,929
one plus one equals three or four right

511
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,860
so these two products if you have them

512
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:59,600
both it's

513
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,790
better than just know the sum of the

514
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:06,830
parts so trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of this stuff</font>

515
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:09,139
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I mostly talked about this</font>

516
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:11,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">but pulling together different sources</font>

517
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">of information so your humans don't have</font>

518
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,030
to spend time on this what's the

519
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:18,230
geographic location of the IP that

520
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:19,309
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just show up in your alert what</font>

521
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,590
purpose does that user have in the

522
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:24,230
organization because that's context you

523
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,549
can use very quickly it might change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

524
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,590
severity<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the alert if it's the sea</font>

525

<font color="#CCCCCC">level person it's about data</font>

527
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:35,240
understanding not necessarily data

528
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,649
volume so you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of data</font>

529
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,330
volume if you can boil that down to

530
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,070
better understanding you can have tons

531
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,649
of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the humans only look at a</font>

532
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit that's the goal right and</font>

533
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,470
orchestration feeds analytics<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

534
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,030
you're pulling all this stuff together

535
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,960
analytics and feed into orchestration

536
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,610
but orchestration can feed into

537
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">analytics it pulls all this different</font>

538
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,290
information and then it does some

539
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:59,928
analysis on it some algorithmic

540
00:21:53,290 --> 00:22:02,230
decision-making you know for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

541
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:06,770
might detonate a binary see what domains

00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:08,270
it connects to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a human has to</font>

543
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:13,010
go do all this extra look up where<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:15,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is is my domain see what does the boys</font>

545
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,419
information who registered it and then

546
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,120
again you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go take</font>

547
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:25,280
action like banning hashes blocking IP

548
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:26,510
sync holding domains guys with me trying

549
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to automate some of this stuff really</font>

thing hit that endpoint isolate that

00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,449
machine from the network until you're

554
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,040
really sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not malicious or</font>

555
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,530
until you can re image or whatever

556
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,899
that's where we're going still need

557
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,040
humans in the loop absolutely but

558
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,400
there's a lot of actions you can take

559
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,270
that are automated that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what I</font>

560
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,270
think about when I think about

561
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:51,500
orchestration so analytics and

562
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,790
orchestration feed each other and

563
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,710
they're both outputting risks they're

564
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:57,740
trying to surface risk to the actual

565
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,880
threats or<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just view risk this is</font>

566
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,140
risky behavior I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure if it's</font>

567
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,590
malicious but you should look at it so

568
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">takeaways</font>

569

good watches<font color="#CCCCCC"> keno if you haven't seen it</font>

00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:31,360
it's about budda loops this notion out

577
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,060
of the military whoever can observe

578
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,060
orient decide and act the fastest is

579
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,590
going to win well if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

580
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,899
visibility you're not really observing

581
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:44,110
until finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> something says hey there's</font>

582
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,940
an alert go look it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might take you too</font>

583
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:52,120
long to orient if you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

584
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:55,810
right context right really the right

context around that event how quickly

586
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,419
can you make a decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

587
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,560
orchestrating everything so you have all

588
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">this information to make quick decisions</font>

589
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,230
and then act we just talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

590
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,330
quickly banning ip's ending hashes

calling user real quick taking a machine

592
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,540
off the off the network that kind of

593
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,370
stuff if you can't move<font color="#CCCCCC"> that quickly</font>

594
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,629
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a losing battle that's</font>

595
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">really where we are right now is the bad</font>

596
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,830
guys move faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> than we do they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

597
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,060
get into these environments they map out

your environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they know it better</font>

599
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:26,679
than you do that's the reality and

600
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,970
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through this right</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NIST incident management lifecycle</font>

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:35,830
faster and more effectively that's the

603
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">whole goal but really the goal is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

604
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:41,889
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> this before there's malicious</font>

610
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,399
exploited or taken advantage of so I

611
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,350
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a lot of different things</font>

612
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,900
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the underlying themes i</font>

613
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:06,240
basically mentioned them but feedback

614
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:09,310
loops something suspicious comes across

615
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,170
your network can you validate it with

616
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:13,929
endpoint or vice versa something runs

617
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,100
that's strange on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer what</font>

618
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,850
does the network device tell you about

00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,649
it what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> dlp what</font>

620
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,760
other security products you have tell

00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,430
you where<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start intelligence study</font>

622
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,100
and ultimately it's about saving humans

00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:28,070
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all understaffed we all spend</font>

624
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:31,030
way too much time on stuff that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

625
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:34,490
really useful doing manual lookups

00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:36,290
chasing down some malicious binary came

627
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,000
across the wire and detonated and no

628
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,710
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad oh but by the way it's</font>

629
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,290
destined for a mac<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a windows</font>

631
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,860
maybe if you have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

632
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,020
reverse engineered or whatever we should

633
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:52,580
not jump out of bed you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just know</font>

634
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:55,100
that oh that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to matter so</font>

635
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,080
just to give you an example to think

636
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,810
about a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times we're looking at</font>

637
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,300
data like this individual events could

638
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:04,370
be binaries<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs where individual</font>

639
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,830
events like in your sim or log mechanism

640
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">right a lot of them basically look the</font>

641
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">same when you start you know to do your</font>

642
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:13,550
analysis but it shouldn't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't</font>

643
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,110
start there you should have stuff like

644
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,659
for an intelligence stuff like

645
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:21,860
reputation information I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

646
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">start on the dark red at least because I</font>

647
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,340
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> my humans to be more effective and</font>

648
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,720
have better priorities right so I'm

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the red</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and someone</font>

650
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,760
thinks that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad but don't stop there</font>

651
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,980
either make it relevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

652
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,840
environment things like prevalence

653
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,460
frequency how often is this occurring

654
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,520
right that's where again<font color="#E5E5E5"> really where</font>

655
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,440
analytics comes in if it's very frequent

656
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,740
and thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be bad well either my</font>

657
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,560
threat intelligence is wrong or I'm

658
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:52,160
screwed but either way you're in a

659
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,870
better spot knowing that but finally

660
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationships this is where it really</font>

661
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:59,090
comes together if some unknown binary

662
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:02,930
starts running but everything it does is

663
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:04,429
known good prioritize that below some

664
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,630
unknown of binary or some new binary

665
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:08,660
running that's doing some things that

666
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:10,190
are unknown about prioritization saving

667
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,230
humans time right focusing your time on

668
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,950
the stuff that actually is risky or a

669
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:18,470
threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's where we were this is</font>

670
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,690
where us as an industry or trying to get

671
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,740
to doing some good things but you know

672
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:26,470
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still always more work to be</font>

673
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:28,140
done and a real concrete example is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0</font>

674
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,180
svchost room

675
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,740
oh great<font color="#E5E5E5"> a crown on every Windows</font>

676
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:36,600
machine or if I tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you svchost respond</font>

677
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,980
by an unsigned binary under strange user

678
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,719
account and made network connection I'm

679
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:44,930
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump out of bed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on Christmas to</font>

680
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:48,090
look at that so remember orchestration

681
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:49,830
analytics risk hunting remember the

682
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,850
goals hopefully we get a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

683
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a little time</font>

684
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">we started late get some Q&A and</font>

685
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,100
discussion going right now but think

686
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:59,550
about how you might apply some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

687
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:03,600
in your environment and I want to tell

688
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:07,200
you a true story after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Home Depot</font>

689
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">breach I got a I got a call saying your</font>

690
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,150
credit card was compromised and it

691
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,160
turned out they used my credit card at

692
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:17,490
target so it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cycle is</font>

693
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:20,630
complete and a true<font color="#CCCCCC"> story us I don't</font>

694
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:25,310
justjust strange coincidence i guess all

695
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,310
questions discussion comments please

696
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,900
yeah so I'll repeat the question for the

697
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:03,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">video or whatever so the question is</font>

698
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:04,420
kind of it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define known bad or</font>

699
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,309
it's hard to you know define what that

700
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,620
is and I was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one of the things I</font>

701
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:10,420
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier was it's easier to</font>

702
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,280
define risk like risky behavior than

703
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,660
malicious behavior and it kind of comes

704
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,740
back to the thing about the credit card

705
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,910
companies they don't know they don't

706
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,830
know what bad behavior looks like that

707
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,000
yeah sure they they basically black list

708
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,580
some merchants and stuff around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

709
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,309
world but they profile you into this

710
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:26,860
fuzzy box and as soon as you you're

711
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:28,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">spending goes way outside that then they</font>

712
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,129
call you right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

713
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,049
known good and then as<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon as it's</font>

714
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,750
outside of known good then they call you

715
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:37,500
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you need to do stuff like you</font>

716
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:40,419
know so I'll just ramble for a second

717
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">ioc's have marginal value there's four</font>

718
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:44,980
billion ipv4 addresses if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

719
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,740
for a few hundred IPS that's not a very

720
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,240
good ratio for billion possible you

721
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,559
looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few hundred it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

722
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,040
bit better odds because you might you

723
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:57,340
know have subsequent usages of those

724
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,570
sites or whatever but you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

725
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,949
automate looking for those you want to

726
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,049
automate looking for strange behavior

727
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,090
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical of malware TTP's like</font>

728
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:05,710
running out of temp directory or

729
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,260
unsigned binary trying to manipulate

730
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,910
some windows service things like that

731
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,919
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed binary but it's signed</font>

732
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:14,350
by some little software vendor they got

733
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,580
hacked or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> so automate some of</font>

734
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:18,428
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> then just start looking for</font>

735
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,230
abnormal behavior and trying to again

736
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:22,330
flip it where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put everyone into</font>

737
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,190
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the like the NASCAR thing if</font>

738
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:26,320
you can try to get closer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a base</font>

739
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:28,480
image like less drift less entropy from

740
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,149
the base image then you can start saying

741
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,590
okay there's enough consistency that any

742
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,120
time there's a new process no one has

743
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever seen before or a new connection no</font>

744
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,699
one has ever made before that's in

745
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:41,820
frequent enough that I can look at that

746
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's that's kind of my advice there</font>

747
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,820
yeah

748
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:53,300
governmental cyberinfrastructure not

749
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:54,889
actually carrying a<font color="#CCCCCC"> perishable wait to</font>

750
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,250
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> defend the country from cyber</font>

751
00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:05,090
threats we are all here as private to

752
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:06,650
the street but my understanding is the

753
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:09,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">Department of Defense was supposed to be</font>

754
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:12,080
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of country and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet we get</font>

755
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,110
invaded continuously from outside of the

756
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,909
country with these threats I

757
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:20,469
specifically so many facts<font color="#E5E5E5"> two gentlemen</font>

758
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:25,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this with no response at the NSA</font>

759
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:28,070
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years ago we could easily</font>

760
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:31,639
determine reputation thread through the

761
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:33,439
NSA database we had availability for our

762
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,510
own infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> for liga stop that</font>

763
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,950
border routers that coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of hybrid</font>

764
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:43,310
they have intercepts on the first place

765
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:44,750
yep so I think they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you done so why</font>

766
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:47,690
are they doing something why are<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

767
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:51,440
lazy blogger is lawful learn an ugly

768
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:53,500
girl to country so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font>

769
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,230
kind of you heard it i'll say it for the

770
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:59,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">recording oh why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't the federal</font>

771
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,190
government especially and Department<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

772
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,139
Defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Intel community doing more</font>

773
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:07,400
right like if your business<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets bombed</font>

774
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,480
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond for you it's</font>

775
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,900
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's more of a political</font>

776
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:16,190
issue of trying to apply too much

777
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:18,470
federal oversight and whether it's real

778
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,500
or not the invasion of privacy is still

779
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:26,660
a huge like battle right the whole

780
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:28,970
privacy versus security um yeah i don't

781
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">i don't know i don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

782
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,560
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like NSA is swamped</font>

783
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,030
with overseas stuff right and they're

784
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,230
really focused more on overseas<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

785
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,960
they do listen phone calls and stuff

786
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:41,270
right but um it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a it's a completely</font>

787
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,710
valid question and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

788
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,629
the same question<font color="#CCCCCC"> why isn't and I think</font>

789
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,580
the government is moving to do more it's

790
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,050
just slow right like it's just slow

791
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,030
they're starting to pass legislation but

792
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:53,750
even that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd think everyone's</font>

793
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:55,040
on board with is a little slow but I

794
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,140
think we will see the federal government

795
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,210
having to step up more at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms</font>

796
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,610
of

797
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:04,070
sharing Intel<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know doing some</font>

798
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:05,270
blocking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of stuff but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

799
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,679
they're still for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long time going to</font>

800
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:11,360
stay hands off on your corporate

801
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:12,830
security and a lot of attacks come from

802
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,840
within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just bounce off</font>

803
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:21,340
an amazon box or Rackspace or whatever

804
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:25,399
right so no no i don't i mean i was at a

805
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:27,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">networked at isp some years ago it was a</font>

806
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:31,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple thing you could imagine somebody</font>

807
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:34,490
hacked<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chinese isp they</font>

808
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:36,860
repointed their mail exchanger writers

809
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:39,680
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> barracuda box of federal</font>

810
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:43,909
facilities that was in our data center

811
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:46,220
world and obviously you're immediately

812
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:50,060
down when you have that was mailed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

813
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:52,070
the traffic that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> false your system we</font>

814
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:56,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">have no idea why we eventually obviously</font>

815
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:59,360
cut all the data flow but just that

816
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,580
basic heuristic which is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> more see</font>

817
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,419
on the lower level suppose you're

818
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:07,310
spending your film US government<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

819
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,960
that visibility on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> border routers to</font>

820
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:11,120
see that traffic coming to the united

821
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,000
states that russia packets they could

822
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,040
stop at the border it's an invalid form

823
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,119
of traffic there's no see there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no way</font>

824
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:23,759
that I'm Alex

825
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:26,669
china the u.s. they could stop it right

826
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,149
away at the mortar yep there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

827
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:32,069
privacy of all your privacy I think I

828
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:38,429
think the generals I think really are

829
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:42,300
here like a duty step down and people

830
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:52,320
are doing yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i mean i think</font>

831
00:34:42,300 --> 00:35:02,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i hear ya let me let me take some</font>

832
00:34:52,320 --> 00:35:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">more here the statement was he wants NSA</font>

833
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:30,450
to stay out we could talk government

834
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:31,770
after blue shirt here so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

835
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,540
is what do these look like an

836
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">implementation well risk hunting is more</font>

837
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,790
of having the right access to

838
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,319
information to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a human go look for</font>

839
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,270
problems and it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be automated a</font>

840
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:43,560
little bit right but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

841
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,970
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find where our</font>

842
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,560
misconfigured like it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font>

843
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,180
hunter mentality I'm gonna go<font color="#CCCCCC"> find where</font>

844
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have misconfigurations or like figure</font>

845
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what boxes can talk to each other</font>

846
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,430
but shouldn't that kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

847
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,529
that's more of a human thing

848
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,578
orchestration is um there's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

849
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,349
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like integration and</font>

850
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:00,839
automation so some coding some scripting

851
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:01,890
but some vendor provided tools that kind

852
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:03,630
of stuff really just pulling together

853
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,640
you know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> just simple things like</font>

854
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:07,260
you have a next-generation firewall that

855
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,910
detonates things you know something on

856
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,619
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> computers they should talk to each</font>

857
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,940
other like you detonate it and then in

858
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,220
your alert it also says oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the way</font>

859
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:17,160
not only was this bad destined for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ben's</font>

860
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:20,430
machine but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it ran just saving time</font>

861
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,690
right and then analytics is also like

862
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,399
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of collecting data and there's a</font>

863
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,069
ton<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new companies and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> products that</font>

864
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">are saying analytics and you know I'm</font>

865
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:28,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">not saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're not doing it but</font>

866
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,350
there

867
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,760
so it's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard problem to</font>

868
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">take all this information process it</font>

869
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,150
find anomalies another<font color="#E5E5E5"> buzzword that I</font>

870
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is machine learning if</font>

871
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,109
you go to like West Coast Bay Area it's

872
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,270
like everyone's third word other mouth

873
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:43,920
is machine learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's really</font>

874
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,680
about finding anomalies and then like

875
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,359
remembering those and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know</font>

876
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,660
improving your algorithm based on that

877
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,880
almost like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a i right but it all comes</font>

878
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,500
down to these are more concepts and

879
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,030
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how you can apply</font>

880
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,740
these with your tools with your people

881
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,950
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your skill sets like programmers or</font>

882
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:05,129
whatever that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

883
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:06,960
implementation is yeah so was regards to

884
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,580
analytics there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

885
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,170
some users that are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard</font>

886
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:12,930
to profile one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to mind is</font>

887
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,430
developers I haven't sure a lot of

888
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,799
people here have<font color="#CCCCCC"> worn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the developer had</font>

889
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:18,868
at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> points and even in a very large</font>

890
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,190
corporate environment developers look

891
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:23,640
really sketchy just when they're

892
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:26,280
normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing their job be that you</font>

893
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:28,618
know random<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scripts running day</font>

894
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,420
in day out port 22 connections to random

895
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:33,720
git repositories on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull</font>

896
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:36,090
something down how would you tackle the

897
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,118
problem of profound a user that's very

898
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:42,109
hard to profile I still think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

899
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,580
easier to profile then you might think

900
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:46,500
but yeah there's definitely so the

901
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,420
question is there's developers and other

902
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,480
people that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very dynamic right so</font>

903
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's hard to profile you can still</font>

904
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,880
restrict what they can do so yeah you

905
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:57,180
can go to anywhere on github com

906
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,410
anywhere and github / whatever like

907
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,460
allow them to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if they go to</font>

908
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">other sites they have to get permission</font>

909
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,260
or whatever I understand there might be

910
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,180
work flow issues or effectiveness where

911
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,970
if it takes too long to get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a special</font>

912
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,879
repo then they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to not do their</font>

913
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:13,529
job well or throw a fit but you can

914
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,700
still figure out like hey they normally

915
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,830
have on visual studio the norm around

916
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">pycharm or whatever intellij pick your</font>

917
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,819
tools right so they start installing all

918
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,410
this other stuff it should be infrequent

919
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,030
enough that you can go say hey why<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

920
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:25,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> installing this or make it so you</font>

921
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,820
can only install stuff that's out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

922
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,210
shared directory or some sort of

923
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:32,280
approved installation folder and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

924
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:34,710
again make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process fast enough so</font>

925
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,109
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need approval or i can get it</font>

926
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:39,900
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes or so yeah it's harder</font>

927
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:42,810
to profile but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's easier than</font>

928
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might think and none</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is like</font>

929
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,600
easy I mean no<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's raising their hands</font>

930
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:49,950
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask who's doing this stuff right</font>

931
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:52,380
um but it's it's not impossible and then

932
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:54,870
I guess so a fault<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that is how we</font>

933
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,520
balance trust against that because at

934
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,230
some point there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are users you need to</font>

935
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,750
fully trust you need to foil a trust

936
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:03,450
your domain admin says that means at

937
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:05,630
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> level where do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel that should</font>

938
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:07,980
be higher than what we normally new or

939
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:10,110
yeah so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of trust</font>

940
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,790
and especially people have like root or

941
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:13,890
domain admin access that kind of stuff

942
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,779
I'll think about feedback loops when

943
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,700
they make changes does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that get logged</font>

944
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,590
some where does it get audited that's

945
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,660
you you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust your employees you</font>

946
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to keep them happy but you're</font>

947
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,750
there's a huge push a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> globally</font>

948
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,430
but nationwide on insider threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge</font>

949
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,080
push all these big companies have

950
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,069
official like budgeted programs an

951
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,630
insider threat they're trying to figure

952
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">out what tools or what processes can do</font>

953
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:38,010
that the government has said you know

954
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:39,300
each department or each organization has

955
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,590
to at least be making progress on

956
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,960
insider threat because I like Snowden

957
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:44,340
and stuff like that um so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font>

958
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,100
a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> push and it's a hard problem to</font>

959
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,260
solve but ultimately if you're at least

960
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,700
doing feedback loops and saying trying

961
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,040
to profile like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the domain admin</font>

962
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,509
should only<font color="#CCCCCC"> login like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I count you only</font>

963
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,160
log<font color="#E5E5E5"> into these four boxes if it's are</font>

964
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:59,670
plugging elsewhere either someone's lazy

965
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,200
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's compromised or whatever so you</font>

966
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,730
do have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust but you do have to</font>

967
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">do some sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of monitoring some sort of</font>

968
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:08,540
auditing as well question I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

969
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,540
have a few more minutes yeah

970
00:40:55,309 --> 00:41:04,109
so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the line</font>

971
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:06,569
John bafite between sort of openness<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

972
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:08,730
enforcement or lockdown right hardening

973
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:10,950
that kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> um which is funny</font>

974
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,119
because that's what our company<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to</font>

975
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time because we have</font>

976
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,210
two products and one is about watching

977
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,470
all the time and letting you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

978
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want I'm gonna trying to be a</font>

979
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,230
product pitch here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other one is</font>

980
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,328
about enforcing and like locking it down

981
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:25,309
so literally like every customer I

982
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:28,559
talked to has like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> question and</font>

983
00:41:25,309 --> 00:41:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's cultural fit first of all um</font>

984
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,130
like I see places in the west coast

985
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,078
where they're like dude we could never

986
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,369
block a process like never stop someone

987
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,549
from installing I just want to see I

988
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:39,599
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know and so a really</font>

989
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:43,470
visibility another buzzword more from

990
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:46,160
last year but visibility is key<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like</font>

991
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:48,988
maybe you give them a little bit more

992
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,940
freedom to install stuff but you're

993
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:52,470
you're literally you know recording and

994
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,670
being notified every time someone

995
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,709
installs something and if that's too

996
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:57,480
voluminous maybe you you filter out like

997
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,910
signed by Microsoft's on by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google son</font>

998
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,589
by whatever so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what really where</font>

999
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:05,308
some of the analytics and automation

1000
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:07,430
come in but I don't know I was a coder

1001
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:09,539
for forever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still write code right and</font>

1002
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,460
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of things I actually</font>

1003
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:14,190
install like daily or weekly is like

1004
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero basically right like over time</font>

1005
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,880
maybe I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a new I IDE your new</font>

1006
00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:19,920
package never had before but it's not

1007
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,269
like all the time like it kind of the

1008
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,279
question like it sounds like there's a

1009
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:25,410
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dynamic activity going on from</font>

1010
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:27,059
these users but really if they can't

1011
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,828
install stuff except for a specific day

1012
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:30,480
or specific directory or whatever I

1013
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:33,450
still think<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

1014
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,230
get their job done just as fast a few

1015
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">more questions discussion black shirt</font>

1016
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:39,230
you

1017
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:54,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">holy automatically a peaceful solution</font>

1018
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:56,950
but then possibly that machine should do

1019
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:59,260
as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible Polly kind of lower</font>

1020
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,029
that threshold you don't have senior

1021
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:04,980
analyst at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know a junior analyst</font>

1022
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:04,980
can still figure out what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1023
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:18,230
yeah so it's um so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

1024
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:21,020
there's there's too much data we still

1025
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:22,790
need a human in the loop when does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1026
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:26,230
just become overwhelming um so again

1027
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,230
it's boiling it down trying to automate

1028
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:32,450
like this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> company in Silicon Valley</font>

1029
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,490
um let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say they probably stream a</font>

1030
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:38,270
lot of videos and shows to you and stuff

1031
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:39,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">um they literally each of their alerts</font>

1032
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,420
because they do all this cool

1033
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,000
orchestration stuff literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

1034
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:46,099
alert has a recommendation so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1035
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh based on all this here's like a score</font>

1036
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:49,339
here's a recommendation reimage or kill

1037
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,050
these processes whatever but a human

1038
00:43:49,339 --> 00:43:52,640
still makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the decision and it has all</font>

1039
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,430
this information like like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font>

1040
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,690
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these themes came from like oh</font>

1041
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,819
it's this user oh by the way they're on

1042
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:01,010
vacation this week so why is that box

1043
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,660
receiving something or this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1044
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,950
domain here's the country here's other

1045
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,420
attacks from that country or other

1046
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,790
connections from that country we've seen

1047
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,310
this week so trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to boil it down but</font>

1048
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:12,290
really if you can get it simplistic

1049
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:13,570
enough so the entry level guy can at

1050
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,529
least figure out if it's worth

1051
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:17,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">escalation not necessarily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make the</font>

1052
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:20,420
decision just try to filter out stuff

1053
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:23,089
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't meet a certain escalation</font>

1054
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:25,540
you know threshold that's really where

1055
00:44:23,089 --> 00:44:25,540
you have to get

1056
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:34,670
I think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going to get</font>

1057
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,050
better at<font color="#E5E5E5"> boiling it down I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're</font>

1058
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,400
really bad at boiling down it's like

1059
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">those dots we're all like these black</font>

1060
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,190
dots right now and the entry-level guy

1061
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:42,920
is like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

1062
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:45,470
um you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some random you</font>

1063
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">know like google com is being alerted on</font>

1064
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:49,220
and stuff like it so I've seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1065
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:55,629
I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> why is that alerting like</font>

1066
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:55,629
that's your not good questions over here

1067
00:44:55,810 --> 00:45:02,590
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be more questions come on yep</font>

1068
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:27,240
another thing I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time sadly</font>

1069
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:30,240
there is no silver bullet for that

1070
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,979
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh the question was I've done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1071
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,470
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good things have pretty good</font>

1072
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,600
posture how do i convince upper

1073
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,040
management that it's not enough or you

1074
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">know to actually implement what I laid</font>

1075
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">out as a plan um so boards are waking up</font>

1076
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">CEOs are waking up you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have some big</font>

1077
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,920
companies where literally every time

1078
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,960
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> board meets like half of their</font>

1079
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,600
board meeting is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyberthreats on</font>

1080
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,160
the flip side it's about risk so I've

1081
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,000
had really large companies say look my

1082
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,560
CEO said I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care if it's a tsunami</font>

1083
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,060
or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyberattack I just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font>

1084
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,740
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> where's the risk and how do I</font>

1085
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,330
mitigate it and so we all think like Oh

1086
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">cyber attack they have to be focused on</font>

1087
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,060
it but no there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these other</font>

1088
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:12,210
risks to your business especially global

1089
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:13,740
businesses um but I think showing how

1090
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:16,410
you can implement it relatively

1091
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,910
painlessly or quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know part</font>

1092
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:20,129
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem or part of the solution</font>

1093
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:22,379
you know showing that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1094
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,190
provide some sort of measurement right

1095
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,990
if you don't measure it you can't

1096
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:26,310
optimize it so saying look we're going

1097
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">to implement this and oh by the way in</font>

1098
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:29,850
three months we're going to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1099
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:33,120
these metrics now metrics is a whole

1100
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:35,670
nother can of worms<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

1101
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:38,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">or bad showing you how to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1102
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:43,170
then trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put it in terms of saving</font>

1103
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:45,000
time and saving money you know it's hard

1104
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use scareware and stuff like hey</font>

1105
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,750
forget breach it's gonna be five million

1106
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,129
dollars or whatever but the news kind of

1107
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:51,900
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you so if you keep it a</font>

1108
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:54,900
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more specific to like hey</font>

1109
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,400
look this new product we come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out if we</font>

1110
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,500
get hacked then<font color="#E5E5E5"> China is just going to</font>

1111
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">produce it for a nickel and cost us a</font>

1112
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,280
hundred dollars right I don't know so

1113
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,859
there's no there's no silver bullet

1114
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,350
there but trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1115
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,060
understand the risk at least and then

1116
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:10,529
show simple things you can do to at

1117
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:15,120
least improve a little bit or<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe a</font>

1118
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:18,950
lot and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk more after two final</font>

1119
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,950
questions anything come on

1120
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:35,040
this guy likes an essay<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually new</font>

1121
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:37,770
general Hayden to it you know I was

1122
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:42,870
nothing you know I was a entry-level guy

1123
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:44,310
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I don't know we did</font>

1124
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:45,839
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting things it was</font>

1125
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:50,730
during Iraq and Afghanistan so there's a

1126
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:54,300
lot of work a lot of supporting the war

1127
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:57,810
fighter I don't know places like that

1128
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:59,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">really make you grow because you can't</font>

1129
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:01,200
just google for the answer you might

1130
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,580
even not even have internet access you

1131
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">might be in a closed environment where</font>

1132
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:07,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">you just have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like figure out how to</font>

1133
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:09,600
you know break something or you know

1134
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:11,850
install something covertly or whatever

1135
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,890
and you just have to work your butt off

1136
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:16,200
to figure it out so you really grow as a

1137
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:18,029
person or as a you know as a

1138
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,710
professional you learn all these skills

1139
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:21,570
and you might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some windows</font>

1140
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:22,650
thing or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux thing you know one day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1141
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:25,710
the other day and they might doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1142
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:27,660
cisco thing or looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some specific</font>

1143
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:29,280
