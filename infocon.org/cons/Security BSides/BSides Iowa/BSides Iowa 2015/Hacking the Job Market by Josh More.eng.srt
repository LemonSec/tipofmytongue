1
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:46,440
so this talk is on hacking the job

2
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,610
market it's basically a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

3
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,879
reconnaissance a little bit of

4
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,829
psychology some tech not a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tech</font>

5
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,050
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what you're expecting great</font>

6
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,350
if not<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a tech heavy presentation</font>

7
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,839
next door so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce myself</font>

8
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,530
those who saw my presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing</font>

9
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:09,509
this joke this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is me I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

10
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,490
for a while and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what I do I have</font>

11
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:13,649
a company I teach<font color="#CCCCCC"> people how to do stuff</font>

12
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is B side so I'm not going any</font>

13
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:20,250
further into that so foundations when

14
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,560
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a job in today's</font>

15
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,590
market you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start with a base</font>

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,220
foundation of consolidation of online

17
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,390
presence typically this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a website</font>

18
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,920
people are doing you know different

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,330
things these days there are lots of ways

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,340
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but generally it's a</font>

21
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">website that collects all of the blog</font>

22
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,420
posts papers you've written

23
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:42,060
presentations you've given articles

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,250
books anything like that in one spot so

25
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have control over how you appear</font>

26
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,619
online and that's really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,969
going for is as much control as you have

28
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:52,619
over your online presence over your

29
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,419
offline presence over the company's you

30
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,969
target and how you present yourself to

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,579
them without this foundation the job

32
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,649
search will fail with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> foundation you</font>

33
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,360
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> land a job that matches you rather</font>

34
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,520
than trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to modify yourself to fit a</font>

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,519
whole that mitten that has been left by

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,228
somebody who's left a job that way you

37
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:12,570
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave the job too quickly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

38
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,489
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really grow in the job and it</font>

39
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:18,329
works with you so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fundamental</font>

40
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:21,390
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind what we're going over so the</font>

41
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:23,760
goal with the the public site is to own

42
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,700
the internet so you want to search on

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,590
Google Bing and Yahoo and basically

44
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,560
control as many of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> hits as you can</font>

45
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,450
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us focus first on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,430
because that's what we use but it's

47
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,589
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that with the</font>

48
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,299
change in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox a lot of people's</font>

49
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,359
default search engine has shifted to

50
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:44,640
being yahoo and anybody on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows using</font>

51
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:46,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">IE has always defaulted to Bing so you</font>

52
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,488
have to have a presence there too now

53
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,650
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get these hits if you're old</font>

54
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:53,520
enough to have a nice work history

55
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,320
behind you you

56
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,170
start repurposing other things you've

57
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,780
done if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still in school here you</font>

58
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,070
can repurpose papers presentations

59
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,870
you've given there and just try to get

60
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,790
as much stuff out there as you can on as

61
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,210
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different sites as you can like</font>

62
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,209
scribd<font color="#E5E5E5"> SlideShare things youtube things</font>

63
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,160
like that because the way all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

64
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:16,080
search engines work is the cross-linking

65
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,640
raises the ranking and if you want

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,530
everything interesting to be at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font>

67
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,179
so all the embarrassing stuff you've

68
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,530
done over your life is towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

69
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,550
bottom and people don't find it as

70
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:29,730
easily if you're in a working

71
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:32,190
environment and you're behind the scenes

72
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,160
like most of us tend to be you need to

73
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,260
slowly move towards having more public

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,359
work done that can mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting involved</font>

75
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,920
in the marketing efforts that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to conferences like this and</font>

presenting and oh it was recorded<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

78
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,820
online I didn't know you know things

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that helped build you this online</font>

presence sometimes for people who are

81
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,430
largely in a deep internal position it

82
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,500
can take more than one job hop to get

83
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,620
fully public the way you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the</font>

92
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,280
economy is going and that's what's being

93
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,870
expected of people your age a lot of

94

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,800
older people are losing jobs and they

97
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,390
just can't get a permanent<font color="#CCCCCC"> job but many</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them have managed to make more money</font>

00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:37,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">than they ever made as a single employee</font>

100
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,469
working for multiple companies in

101
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:42,840
multiple freelance you know environments

102
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,510
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to do this kind of</font>

103
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,739
thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the open source community</font>

104
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,690
software development is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the classic</font>

105
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,940
route you know you can learn good skills

106
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:56,760
that way but the need is in writing

107
00:04:52,940 --> 00:05:00,060
manuals in line help online how to's

108
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,640
things like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know open source</font>

109
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,800
technology is wonderful but<font color="#E5E5E5"> since it's</font>

110
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,690
written by engineers it has crappy

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,350
documentation and really poor project

112
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,590
management

113
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:12,870
so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to build a presence</font>

114
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,830
quickly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can step into one of those</font>

115
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">roles and it'll work really well for you</font>

116
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,680
so with that in mind if you're employed

117
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,320
you might need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to leave and</font>

118
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,930
when it's time to leave is really either

119
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,480
you've grown out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the job or the job</font>

120
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,610
has grown away from you and most

121
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,740
companies go through four phases in

122
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,870
their growth now they can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> backwards</font>

123
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,690
it's not always a direct relatively

124
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,210
linear progression but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when</font>

125
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,640
when a company starts out it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

126
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,440
up you know the stereotypical is the guy

127
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,030
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his garage right you know it could be</font>

128
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,070
a couple of people in their basement it

129
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,809
could be a small start-up<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it tends</font>

130
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,690
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run under what I call cowboy style</font>

131
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,160
management where people are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it</font>

132
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,280
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just get it done</font>

133
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they move on and as the business</font>

134
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,710
grows you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start trusting your</font>

135
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,719
people now around 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 30 people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

136
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,479
shifts from cowboy style management to a

137
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,460
trust-based model where the people

138
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,230
owning the company kind of trust what

139
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,479
what individuals are doing and give them

140
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> power to do it well when they grow</font>

141
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,700
bigger around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 50 to 75 range that</font>

142
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,500
trust starts to break down because the

143
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,630
person who<font color="#CCCCCC"> owns the company is no longer</font>

144
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,460
hiring all those people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font>

145
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,219
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> some light structure in on the</font>

146
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,810
management side and then as it grows

147
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,070
bigger you get more structure and

148
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,240
eventually it's a really big side you

149
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,520
have multiple layers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

150
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,110
management what most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people find is</font>

151
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,719
their most comfortable at one of these

152
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,940
four points<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when a company grows or</font>

153
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,250
shrinks below one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those levels it's</font>

154
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,990
time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go so it's important to kind of</font>

155
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,790
know who you are how you feel the most

156
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,070
comfortable where you feel the most

157
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,350
comfortable so you can identify when

158
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,360
that transition point is coming so when

159
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,700
it hits your prepared and you're not

160
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,800
caught in a layoff or just feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

161
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,570
hate going into work stuff like that I

162
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,310
mean there are other reasons why you can

163
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,159
leave you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are asshole job you</font>

164
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,750
know managers they can come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

165
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,880
bad projects you can get thrown out of

166
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:13,290
the bus by people but most of the people

167
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,460
who make strategic job decisions I find

168
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,900
it's because one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these job</font>

169
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,870
transitions now how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you identify when</font>

170
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,760
these are coming

171
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,070
you know it's you can keep your eye on

172
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,409
the business kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's going on in</font>

173
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,090
the business how are people hiring how's

174
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">it growing or shrinking you can also</font>

175
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,609
watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> industry</font>

176
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,180
tells you what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on job wise</font>

177
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:40,210
through job ads and if you if you watch

178
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,820
kind of how jobs flow you'll know that

179
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">here in the Midwest you know stick yuly</font>

180
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,770
in Iowa you tend to get jobs after

181
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,380
Minnesota gets jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> Minnesota gets jobs</font>

182
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,229
after they get jobs on the coasts so if

183
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,630
you start setting up RSS feeds for job

184
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:58,420
titles that interest you in major

185
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:01,750
markets on the coasts and then in Omaha

186
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:05,200
Chicago and Minneapolis you will get

187
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:07,450
probably three to two months lead time

188
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,539
on when those jobs will start hiring

189
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:16,570
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can be ready for that as</font>

190
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:18,190
well okay now before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go on into the</font>

191
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:23,110
the job p so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

192
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:25,570
about resumes resumes fail typically

193
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">because there are too many we're in a</font>

194
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,530
global economy we're in a highly

195
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,890
networked economy which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> every job</font>

196
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:35,829
opening can get hundreds to thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

197
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,080
resumes and what hiring managers are

198
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do is filter as quickly as they</font>

199
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibly can to get down to resumes they</font>

200
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,650
actually care about nobody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

201
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:46,870
read a thousand resumes and based upon

202
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,870
the merits many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't even read</font>

203
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,330
20 but generally speaking you try to

204
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,130
knock it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then you</font>

205
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,740
know filter below that to get what you

206
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,420
want so often<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first cut is college</font>

207
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,460
degree so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> college</font>

208
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,430
degree you're often never<font color="#E5E5E5"> your resume</font>

209
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,950
may never get seen then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks for</font>

210
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,540
certifications looks for high salaries

211
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,450
looks for experience you're just trying

212
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:14,589
to winnow the list down to as small as

213
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:16,810
they can get so today most resumes are

214
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,890
written to get search engine attention

215
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,390
and to drive discussion and that's it

216
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:25,330
nobody makes hiring decisions based off

217
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:28,150
of resumes anymore so what I'll cover

218
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,560
letters now in the old days<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

219
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,290
include a cover layer with the resume to

220
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,430
entice people to read the resume well

221
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,110
today

222
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,180
with a thousand cover letters nobody's

223
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,980
going to read those anyway so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

224
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,060
bold you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are doing some</font>

225
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,800
really interesting stuff with

226
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,219
infographics has anybody seen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> My</font>

227
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">Little Pony tech resume anybody ok</font>

228
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,720
Google that when you get home it's it's

229
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,130
brilliant the guy has basically created

230
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,980
a resume that filters them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of eighty</font>

231
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:56,020
percent of all jobs but the ones that

232
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,630
like him he's going to stick out above

233
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:02,100
everybody else it's a perfect example of

234
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:05,500
targeting you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> target the similar way</font>

235
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,660
with cover letters what you want to do

236
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,660
is basically in five to thirty<font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds</font>

237
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,660
explain why somebody should hire<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and</font>

238
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask for a meeting now that's the</font>

239
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,469
traditional way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it other ways to</font>

240
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:19,959
do it involve meeting people at

241
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:22,630
conferences you know and basically

242
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:25,119
tracking people down through social

243
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,580
media through the internet and getting

244
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,600
the invite in because the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> to success</font>

245
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:33,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">is to get past this filter process you</font>

246
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,970
know you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come in the back in the</font>

247
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:40,270
back door and avoid all of hrs filters

248
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,339
so that when they want to hire<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the</font>

249
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,550
hiring manager or the CEO or whoever

250
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:47,470
goes to HR and says hire this person and

251
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,109
then they make you go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the steps</font>

252
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,970
but it's already decided you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

253
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,250
to worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being filtered out you're</font>

254
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:58,150
just you know dotting the i's and

255
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,680
crossing the t's any questions you know

256
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:04,240
that's kind of the foundation stuff any

257
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,910
questions at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

258
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,060
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little about stories humans</font>

259
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:12,310
are hard-wired for story we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know</font>

260
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:16,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">meaning we want to learn meaning from</font>

261
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:19,630
others<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because we've evolved</font>

262
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,400
to learn from other people's mistakes so

263
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,020
you know we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like hearing what</font>

264
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,490
others have done how others have screwed

265
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,990
up we like laughing at them when they've

266
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:31,000
screwed up which is why I'm sharing some

267
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:33,940
of the images I am so in a job interview

268
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be interesting</font>

269
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,339
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> being arrogant and what's really</font>

270
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,829
interesting is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people start out</font>

271
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:44,380
when they're young as very arrogant and

272
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:46,150
then instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of learning to be</font>

273
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,560
interesting they simply stop telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

274
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,910
interest

275
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,099
stories so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really good skill</font>

276
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,279
to try to learn is how to tell a good

277
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,860
story how to be interesting and not come

278
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:01,710
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a braggart so how do you do</font>

279
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,160
this one way is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go with this index</font>

280
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:08,430
index card approach so on an index card

281
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,050
represents a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that index card</font>

282
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,719
you need to note why was the problem

283
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,069
significant who is affected when you

284
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,710
know who is affected you've created the

285
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,420
cast of characters for your story with

286
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,820
who will the interviewer be sympathetic

287
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,410
that's the lead character what

288
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,990
challenges stood in the way that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

289
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,939
villain what didn't work that's the

290
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,670
hero's journey because you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

291
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,500
identify this is the path I took

292
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,300
otherwise it's just a problem problem

293
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,890
solved you're done and you want to have

294
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,529
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a lead in and I'll get</font>

295
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that a little bit on the back you</font>

296
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:41,520
want to summarize that story in one line

297
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,140
and that story<font color="#E5E5E5"> then goes in the resume</font>

298
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,970
and the resume becomes this list of

299
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,430
stories and you don't worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about length</font>

300
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,830
you know if you've been in the job

301
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,449
market<font color="#E5E5E5"> for five years you know you might</font>

302
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,790
have two pages if you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the job</font>

303
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,190
market for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 years you might have a lot</font>

304
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,270
more length at this point doesn't matter

305
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,150
because you're gonna be doing a self

306
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,350
filter before you send it out so you

307
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically put the stories in</font>

308
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,730
chronological order build the master

309
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,010
resume and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then when you're ready to go</font>

310
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,500
you identify these are the stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

311
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,420
care about to tie want to tell in the

312
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,810
interview<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything else out</font>

313
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,969
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets down to one page so</font>

314
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,729
then you tell the story how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tell</font>

315
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:23,850
a story this is a classic story

316
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:26,220
structure you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an initial hook which</font>

317
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,530
is then partially resolved and then you

318
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,630
have a secondary hook partially resolved

319
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:33,990
then you've got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary hook and you</font>

320
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:36,060
end you don't want to resolve the story

321
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,760
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling it because you want</font>

322
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,709
them to invite you in for an interview

323
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,689
so it's about kind of leading the

324
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:45,180
discussion planting enough information

325
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,650
as social engineers do but instead of

326
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data and getting out like</font>

327
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,400
you do in social engineering you want to

328
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:54,089
leave it<font color="#CCCCCC"> there because they need to ask</font>

329
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,949
you back the point of stories is to

330
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,050
convince somebody else that you're

331
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,750
awesome

332
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:03,269
and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to understand</font>

333
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,070
the audience you need to understand what

334
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:06,899
they're interested in so you can

335
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,550
repackage yourself to be interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

336
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,930
them and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be typically</font>

337
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,089
three types of people you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

338
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,640
talk to there's the distracted type

339
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:16,519
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have half a minute to</font>

340
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,800
two minutes to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your point across</font>

341
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,360
this is the classic elevator speech you

342
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,209
know get it down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a very small amount</font>

343
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,850
so you can get it in and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully</font>

344
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:28,439
they'll say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh tell me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more second</font>

345
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,519
person is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're relatively attentive</font>

346
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,260
if you have between three and five

347
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,180
minutes this is where this narrative

348
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:36,060
structure really comes in because you

349
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,939
can expand you can flesh things out for

350
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,250
each point on the resume<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

351
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,370
practice telling a story using a timer

352
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,320
and identifying you know why did the

353
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem matter how did it affect people</font>

354
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,070
what was the problem solving process

355
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,260
what solutions and challenges did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

356
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,470
have what was the final solution and get

357
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,149
that story told in three minutes and

358
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,620
leave the hooks there so they can ask

359
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:00,450
you back later because what you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

360
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,520
do is convert these people into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

361
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,200
third type which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the involved or</font>

362
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,630
interruptive type and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

363
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,970
be bouncing the ideas back off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it</font>

364
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,140
becomes much more of a discussion

365
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:13,020
because discussions is how you make

366
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,000
friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends hire friends that's</font>

367
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,290
what you're wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have happen so</font>

368
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,910
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to let that in that case you</font>

369
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,180
want to let the story flow and expand

370
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,709
and fill the time this is another way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

371
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,719
look at it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a social engineering</font>

372
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:27,689
perspective so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interest</font>

373
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,730
curve over time when most people are

374
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,610
having a conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what they're</font>

375
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing there's a straightforward you know</font>

376
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,450
they're interested they get more

377
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,790
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

378
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,380
curiosity gets satisfied and they're

379
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:43,260
done and they go on an interview the

380
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,880
next person what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is put</font>

381
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,279
little hooks in the conversation each

382
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,529
one boosting the interest level so when

383
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,260
you run at a time they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you</font>

384
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:53,820
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue the conversation that's</font>

385
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,420
the social manipulation you're going

386
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,459
through you want to be incomplete so

387
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,829
they cask you back so you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

388
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,839
persuading people like to understand

389
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:05,819
things and get done and that's that's

390
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the psychological mechanism you want to</font>

391
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,160
trigger and an interrupt

392
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:14,339
so so yeah these are the two

393
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,529
conversation streams so then you want to

394
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about where do you want to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

395
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:19,800
what what kinds of things do you want to

396
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,779
do what kind of companies are that do

397
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a basic scoring</font>

398
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,829
approach you know list out the things

399
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,690
that you find interesting list out the

400
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:30,420
company's you're considering and score

401
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,310
each one because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a targeted job</font>

402
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,680
search this is not a cast your resume to

403
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:36,689
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wind and hope something bites this</font>

404
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,180
is you know you have company number one

405
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,100
then two<font color="#E5E5E5"> then three then four each one</font>

406
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,569
gets a custom variant of the resume when

407
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,880
you're targeting each one you have

408
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,070
modified your website or whatever web

409
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,709
presence you're controlling so that it's

410
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:53,760
targeted in order to maximize your

411
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:55,140
chance at each step in the process so

412
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,620
we're going to stop a little bit here

413
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,089
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ethics okay the rest of this</font>

414
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,850
presentation is about intelligence

415
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:04,410
gathering the company's<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're targeting</font>

416
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,260
and the people you're talking to have

417
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:10,890
not given you permission to do any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

418
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,329
this stuff so it's basically step one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

419
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,760
a penetration test you're doing without

420
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,889
authorization now it's all public data

421
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,720
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily illegal</font>

422
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,540
though you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly use some of</font>

423
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,520
these tools of this way but you have to

424
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,619
decide before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start how deep you</font>

425
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,480
want to go and the reason you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

426
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:30,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is there are aspects of the</font>

427
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,669
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that show aspects of people</font>

428
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,350
that you may not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there are</font>

429
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain things about people you don't</font>

430
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,899
want to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you're sitting across</font>

431
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,770
the table from them having a job

432
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:43,260
interview and it might help to look at

433
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,970
what sorts of sites are out there that

434
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,160
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go to before you start</font>

435
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,510

436
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,130
that i'm sure you all know what kind of

437
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:55,890
sites i'm talking about so basically be

438
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,510
careful the other thing to know you're

439
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,360
up against people who are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

who are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be left less ethical</font>

hacking to get the data they need the

444
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,580
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking about the techniques</font>

445
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,500
I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's nothing new</font>

446
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:17,030
people have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it for a long</font>

447
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:19,230
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's new is we're now aware of it</font>

448
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's becoming a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more</font>

449
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,909
acceptable in some cases a little

450
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,000
us you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do this kind of</font>

451
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:28,529
stuff in a military setting for example

452
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,350
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of bigger companies and</font>

453
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:34,500
smaller companies are expecting more

454
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:38,330
preparation from job interviewees then

455
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,380
we're used to giving so with that

456
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:44,100
Google's a search engine we all know

457
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,720
that but there's more you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

google news<font color="#CCCCCC"> I imagine we've all used</font>

to search on a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> name the company</font>

461
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,299
you're targeting the products there

they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for the officers that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">are involved you know there have been</font>

464
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:59,909
times when you can do a search on an

<font color="#E5E5E5">officer and find out that the person you</font>

just got arrested and your problem

468
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:08,309
that'll be interviewing with that person

469
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,918
you know it's useful data<font color="#CCCCCC"> there google</font>

plugged the address of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business in</font>

472
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,549
on google maps that sorry the business

473
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,230
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> and google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maps to get all of the</font>

addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then plug all of those</font>

475
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,149
addresses back into google because

476
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,090
what's interesting is in multi site

477
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:29,340
locations you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> often find user groups</font>

478
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,199
that meet in a business and if you find

<font color="#CCCCCC">a user group you can go in and you can</font>

480
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,409
see what the business is like before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

481
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,570
interview lots of useful data that way

482
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:41,279
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> google groups forms usenet</font>

483
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,668
postings they<font color="#E5E5E5"> leak a lot of data about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the technology that's in use internally</font>

485
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:48,029
blogs if you can identify the people's

486
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,500
names the Google Blog search can find

487
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:51,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">those people you can find the topics</font>

488
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,860
they're interested in which gives you

489
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:55,620
those little interest hooks you plant in

490
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the conversation as you go a google</font>

491
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,010
patent very useful if the companies

492
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,389
filed any patents and if you actually

493
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,919
take the time to read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> patent</font>

494
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:03,449
application you're going to be more

495
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,549
qualified<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the position that anybody</font>

496
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,929
who already works there because very few

497
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:10,200
employees read their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own company's</font>

498
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:11,460
patents and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Code searches</font>

499
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,769
and things like that will give you a

500
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:18,899
sense of code style but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

501
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:21,600
there's Bing everybody he's being right

502
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:25,649
that's great anybody use the big events

503
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:29,100
sub search<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this allows you to</font>

504
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:31,649
search within events so you search for a

505
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,199
type of event and then you sub filter

506
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:35,949
it's a second layer of search that Bing

507
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,200
offers that nobody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

508
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,080
and that way you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cut out a</font>

509
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,029
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> direct that you don't need</font>

510
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,730
there's a tool called yippee which is a

511
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:48,490
metadata remixer it allows you to deeper

512
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,769
searches through iteration not simply do

513
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,690
one search and be done it's intended to

514
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:55,600
iterate through the different searches

515
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:58,029
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> X quick and dogpile we've</font>

516
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,539
all heard of I hope those are basic

517
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:03,700
multi-engine searches there's yay see

518
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:06,250
which does a deeper search it's a little

519
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,860
harder to set up and then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> social</font>

520
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,870
s 0 dot CL which is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft</font>

00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,299

523
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:18,519
there's data that's useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you it</font>

524
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,440
will give you everything absolutely

525
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:22,179
everything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a person all of their</font>

527
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,649
interested in what their schedule is it

528
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,679
when it hits it hits big it just doesn't

529
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:31,539
hit very often so as you go through this

530
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,639
process you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want to take</font>

531
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:37,658
notes I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use blank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text files</font>

532
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:39,100
normally when I give this talk to

533
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:40,450
college kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to explain what a</font>

535
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:46,000
word I'm imagine you all know this you

536
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:48,130
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> gather timeline data current</font>

537
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,500
data and email formatting data as well

538
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">as whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is interesting because those</font>

539
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,690
particular pieces are going to be useful

540
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">later you can go through automated</font>

541
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:01,690
searching everybody used harvester come

542
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,809
on download harvester play with

543

547
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:19,979

access to the paid linkedin features

549
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,539
because using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the site and the in</font>

550
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:27,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">URL modifiers you can find all of the</font>

552
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,029
company what their titles are things

553
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:32,590
like that if you have the names from

554
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:35,230
this and you have the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses</font>

555
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,209
from harvester it's just a quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python</font>

or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Perl script to create likely email</font>

557
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,760
addresses which is very useful later in

558
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:47,250
the process

559
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,870
yeah recon ng yeah yeah recon ng is one

560
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,540
I was going to skip over because I have

561
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:55,199
limited time re can IG is an excellent

562
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:57,960
tool it's basically recon within a

563
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit like interface there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

564
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,900
of paid features it it searches api's so

565
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:07,080
if there's a paid API you can do deep

566
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,540
searches<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can also pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

567
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,600

568
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,840
forces datacom or Hoover's or sometimes

569
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,240
you can find credentials to get in and

570
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives you a lot of data that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sales</font>

571
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">people use on companies which can feed</font>

572
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:25,830
the process as well now there's deeper

573
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,350
recon you've got the basic info it's

574
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:31,050
time to extrapolate because once you

575
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:33,090
know who works there what they do what

576
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the products are the question is what</font>

577
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,040
challenges challenges do they face

578
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:40,260
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to present yourself as</font>

00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,919
their stock goes up

723
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,919
by 10 points and their competitors goes

724
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:29,450
up by 50 they're losing the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

725
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,760
though they're becoming more profitable

726
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,470
an understanding that mindset is

727
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,610
critical in determining the types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

728
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:39,740
stories you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell in the process</font>

729
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:41,178
so then you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze the people</font>

730
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,190
you're talking to by this point you

731
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:45,169
should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a feel for who you're going</font>

732
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:47,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to interview with who their bosses who</font>

733
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:50,090
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> boss's boss is all the way up the</font>

734
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:52,280
tree and you can feed this you can fit

735
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:54,168
into multi go the mapping tool i

736
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,260
mentioned earlier you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know searching on</font>

737
00:29:54,169 --> 00:30:00,980
different people you can also use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a name</font>

738
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:03,710
check in size to identify likely social

739
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:06,289
media presences and then if you can find

740
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,909
those types of user<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids you can just</font>

741
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:09,890
rate google searches on it that's where

742
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:11,330
you might get into trouble and find data

743
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:17,409
on fetish sites that you don't really

744
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:17,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know about voice of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

745
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:22,100
look at facebook twitter pinterest

746
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:25,700
flickr we all know those also<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe the</font>

747
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:27,678
old sites people abandoned old accounts

748
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,809
they don't shut them down so there's

749
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,450
data out there on myspace livejournal

750
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:34,908
and friendster still it can be quite

751
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:39,320
useful you want to identify their

752
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:40,909
personality now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would normally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

753
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,320
conversation about metaphor mapping here

754
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:44,120
anybody who saw me this morning has

755
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,939
already seen it if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't checked</font>

756
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,580
out the video later these two books are

757
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,610
excellent metaphors we live by if you

758
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a deep academic background is great</font>

759
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,908
everybody should read images of

760
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,709
organization it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the way you</font>

761
00:30:55,909 --> 00:31:04,070
communicate so now it's time to

762
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:06,770
reposition who you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's on</font>

763
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is there forever now you</font>

764
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:10,340
can always go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into your different sites</font>

765
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:12,200
and I assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody's using keep a</font>

766
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,850
sore last pass or something so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

767
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,830
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of all of the sites on which you</font>

768
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:19,010
have accounts right we're all doing that

769
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:20,918
right okay visit each one and make sure

770
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the privacy settings</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are locked down if</font>

771
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:25,700
there's one you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want shut this</font>

772
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,520
close it out you know get rid of it

773
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely because you want to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

774
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:34,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you show up the way you want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

775
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,149
seen Google and Bing are not search

776
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,639
engines

777
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:41,478
their lenses that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the world</font>

778
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:42,918
uses to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> things into focus so what</font>

779
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:45,259
they're going to do is they're going to

780
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">identify the pieces of you that you want</font>

781
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:50,509
others to know about in the top two

782
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:53,719
pages and almost nobody hits the third

783
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:55,309
page of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google results or deeper so</font>

784
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:59,119
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really what you're looking for is</font>

785
00:31:55,309 --> 00:32:02,119
to control that level of things social

<font color="#CCCCCC">media sites are lint our votes each link</font>

cross-linking it going on the more you

790

can can own the search on your name and

791
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:18,559
then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes time to do a cover letter</font>

00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:20,749
you know cover letters are or an

810
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:05,539
maintain as much control over the

00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:07,218
process as you can so that when when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

say I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to call you call that</font>

813
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:11,029
shows you have follow through which most

814
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:13,159
people don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and that's going to</font>

impress them enough in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases to</font>

816
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,719
invite you in for an interview now when

817
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,399
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this odds are each time you call</font>

818
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:20,089
they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer they're busy</font>

819
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:21,468
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to leave a</font>

820
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:23,509
voicemail so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to write a</font>

821
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:25,580
voicemail script ahead of time so it

822
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:28,219
sounds straight to the point powerful

823
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,899
and intentional instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having a lot</font>

824
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:31,909
of ohms and us and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font>

00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:34,218
expected to talk to somebody write the

826
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:35,899
script practice it before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you call so</font>

827
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:39,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">when it got you call it goes through</font>

828
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:41,418
regularly now if all this works you may

829
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:42,978
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to go through a couple of people to</font>

830
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:46,110
get it to work but it normally works

831
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:50,440
you'll have a phone interview

832
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:54,610
that's the cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> letter example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

833
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:58,169
phone meetings what's likely to happen

834
00:33:54,610 --> 00:34:01,059
is they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call you and say</font>

835
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:04,900
okay are you ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interview and</font>

836
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:06,789
the answer is always no the answer is

837
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,500
always I'm sorry I'm heading out the

838
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:09,909
door I've got to catch<font color="#E5E5E5"> a meeting can we</font>

00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,250
schedule something for a couple of days

840
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:16,240
from now now why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that</font>

841
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:18,159
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to maintain control you</font>

be able to stand up when you talk

866
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,830
because people who stand up sound better

867
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,690
and you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to have them or</font>

870
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:15,040
they sound friendlier now that puts most

871
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,310
people in the bathroom and you might not

872
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do that so get a mirror hang it</font>

873
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:23,080

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can have this discussion</font>

875
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,930
your two goals in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> process is get a</font>

876
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,260
real interview and get the information

877
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:33,399
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to win at the real interview</font>

878
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,090
avoid all the distractions you're not

879
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,790
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to chat it's all business okay</font>

880
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:41,230

885
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,910
in-person interview you need to be able

886
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,700
to take control of that and people like

887
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:57,160
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to have something to</font>

custom materials this is materials

899
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,460
created from the reconnaissance work

900
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:28,200
you've done this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be where</font>

901
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,910
you have market research we've

902
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,710
identified gaps in the markets you know

903
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,990
disruptive forces coming they might not

904
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:36,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">have thought of yet competitors how the</font>

competitors<font color="#CCCCCC"> rank against one another not</font>

906
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,509
how the competitors rank against the

907
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,680
company you're interviewing<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

908
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,329
they're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> expert in their company</font>

909
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,348

910
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:46,109
company because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend all their</font>

911
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:47,940
time making sure their stuffs working so

912
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:50,069
by comparing all of the competitors to

913
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,260
one another you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then create a gap</font>

914
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:54,359
it's like hey nobody's doing this you

915
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,099
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little spot charts you</font>

00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:02,400
want it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey nobody's doing this</font>

918
00:36:58,109 --> 00:37:04,020
here is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> area you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to focus you</font>

919
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,569
want to create flow documents and

920
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:10,589
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually done a pci data flow</font>

921
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:13,619
any pci consultants here<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the same</font>

922
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:15,328
concept behind a pci data flow which is

923
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:18,029
how data moves through an environment

924
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:19,799
applies to other business processes it

925
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:22,170
applies to sales processes it applies to

926
00:37:19,799 --> 00:37:23,910
internal operational processes whatever

927
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:26,160
you're doing those sorts of flow

928
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,808
diagrams visually depict things in ways

929
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,910
most people aren't used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to seeing and</font>

930
00:37:27,809 --> 00:37:31,980
when they see it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh it all</font>

931
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:35,700
makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and they're really easy</font>

932
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:37,470
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at products and</font>

933
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,500
service bundling you know finding other

934
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:43,140
ways to to basically pivot their

935
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,270
products so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks new to them you</font>

professional with one exception one

939
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:58,950
document needs to have a typo why do you

940
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">want a typo because when you're sitting</font>

941
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,879
in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and you pull out the</font>

942
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:06,089
folder to give them their copy you go oh

943
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,279
I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> typo and you Circle</font>

944
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:11,099
it and you say I'll send you another

945
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:13,010
copy soon the end of the interview<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

946
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:16,150
now have an excuse to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send them an email</font>

947
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:19,370
and you give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> the corrected document</font>

948
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,080
that shows you remembered you have

949
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:23,509
follow through and you have fast

950
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:27,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">turnaround which is exactly what</font>

951
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:31,040
companies want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see visual design</font>

952
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:32,930
matters this seems overwhelming and

953
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,279
expensive particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not a</font>

958
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:49,730
evenings and there are online tutorials

information on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use these tools</font>

963
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,340
what you do is you go to the website

964
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:03,170
fire up GIMP take a screenshot take up

965

the eyedropper tool find the hex codes

documents you're going to create in

969
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:13,220
LibreOffice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> inkscape and then all</font>

you do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put together whatever</font>

flows you want whatever diagrams you

972
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,080
want and keep it simple and it works

973
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:22,939
really well if you need stencils or

974
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,460

at a higher salary level and usually

1169
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:57,109
they will find the money sometimes they

open to hearing your ideas or putting

pay very seldom<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow through systems</font>

1193
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:57,600
are constructed so performance is based

1194
00:47:54,870 --> 00:48:00,930
on the way the team works how well the

1195
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:02,940
team does so you're in a situation where

1196
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:04,200
you are not getting paid for your

1197
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,640
performance you're getting paid for your

1198
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,439
team's performance and anybody who's

1199
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:11,960
done group projects in school knows that

1200
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:14,460
doesn't work so take any other offer

1201
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:17,070
think about non financial stuff training

education paid time off advancements in

1203

seniority a lot of companies will bring

1234
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:32,999
the you know after so you basically have

overlapped by one day and the month<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

yours depending on how the jobs created

00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:36,680
so your options are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know leave it</font>

1263
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,109
behind try to buy it from the company

1264
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,940
don't necessarily recommend stealing it

1265
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:43,558
or recreate it as an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source project</font>

1267
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:48,269
useful you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have those options</font>

1268
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:50,279
in front of you and once all that's done

1269
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:54,118
give notice in writing they're good ways

1270
00:50:50,279 --> 00:50:57,059
and bad ways to do that think about

1271
00:50:54,119 --> 00:51:00,380
negotiation rates for work you do after

1272
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:03,719
you leave if they view as indispensable

1273
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:07,319
one thing you can do is say hey if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1274
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:10,499
need me my negotiation rate or<font color="#E5E5E5"> by after</font>

1275
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:12,299
work rate is 250 dollars an hour and if

1276
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:13,680
they say well that's high you can say

1277
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:16,130
well it'd be lower if you knock this

1278
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,910
non-compete out of the way you know

negotiating on things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,680
now you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be given a counteroffer</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">counter offers their games you only play</font>

1284
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:32,740
once it burns your current employer and

1285
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:35,078
your prospective employer and you will

1286
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:37,509
really probably never get a raise there

1287
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:40,839
again if you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a counteroffer so</font>

1288
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:43,000
it's almost never worth playing which

1289
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:44,980
gets us to the exit interview when

1290
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,750
you're leaving hr's are going to sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1291
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">down and they're going to say well we'd</font>

1292
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:50,559
really like you to tell us what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could</font>

1293
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:53,470
have done better they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to know</font>

1294
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:56,019
if they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they would have</font>

1295
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:58,538
fixed it before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> left so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>

1296
00:51:56,019 --> 00:52:01,089
is always it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a change and</font>

1297
00:51:58,539 --> 00:52:04,930
just let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it go and walk out the door</font>

1298
00:52:01,089 --> 00:52:09,869
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your new job so this information</font>

1299
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:16,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">came from these resources and these ones</font>

1300
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:19,150
and those and those and I put it all in

1301
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:22,118
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> book so if you want the book feel free</font>

1302
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:24,369
to buy the book it's available anywhere

1303
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:29,049
online books are sold or pirated so

1304
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:32,640
enjoyed and I'll leave that up for a

1305
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:32,640
little while any questions at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

1306
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:56,190
so that's true I mean you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should there's</font>

1307
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:59,200
a psychological concept of pinning and

1308
00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:01,089
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> named your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number first then</font>

1309
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,169
their offer is going to come closer to

1310
00:53:01,089 --> 00:53:03,820
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> number than whatever number they</font>

1311
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:06,730
had in their head people talk about

1312
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,710
doing ranges things like that the idea

1313
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:11,650
behind total compensation is to figure

1314
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what you will accept what your range</font>

1315
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:15,520
is so you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get your total</font>

1316
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,660
comp and if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to move for</font>

1317
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,890
something that's interesting not

1318
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,690
necessarily more money you can do plus

1319
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:24,580
or minus ten percent on that and that's

1320
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:26,920
your asking range in general the idea of

1321
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:31,060
them saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the price first is great</font>

1322
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:32,770
what is turned into today is it's like a

1323
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:34,089
junior<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dance everybody standing on</font>

1324
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,500
the sides nobody actually wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1325
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:39,279
dance nobody wants to name a number

1326
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:41,080
first so put that aside if you know what

1327
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,280
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> damn number and</font>

1328
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:55,299
move on with the stuff that actually

1329
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:58,540
matters I believe he was next look at

1330
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:01,060
this guy's resume then what does resume

1331
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:04,240
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we googled the guy conda's</font>

1332
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:06,310
resume online and it didn't he<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

1333
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,830
you know put certain things in the

1334
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,970
resume yeah he didn't have before so

1335
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:11,319
it's like does he actually have that

1336
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:12,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience could be cooking on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1337
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:18,910
resume here but the one he had out

1338
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:20,800
online well so if you have control<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

1339
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:22,990
your presence the resumes will match

1340
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,760
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be targeting one company</font>

1341
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:26,680
at a time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know which resume you sent</font>

1342
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:30,430
out you update the online one to match

1343
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:32,770
what you want the problem is companies

1344
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:35,680
like dice and monster I mean I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

1349
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,700

1350
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:50,049
certain point but you know some mistakes

1351
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,339

1356
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:13,170
piracy site it's been people like it a

00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,790
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say it's overly technical</font>

a lot of technical people say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1359
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:21,090
technical enough which means I hit that

1368
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:51,720
concern because everybody's made a typo

1369
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:54,420
and the fact that you follow up and

1370
