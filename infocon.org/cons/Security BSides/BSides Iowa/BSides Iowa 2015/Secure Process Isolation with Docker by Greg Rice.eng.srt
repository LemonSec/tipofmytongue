1
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:48,080
so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Greg rice i'm here today</font>

2
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:52,519
to present secure isolation with using

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,769
docker it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have many</font>

4
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,480
people in the room that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I kind of</font>

5
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,000
knew this was going to happen when

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,099
you're presenting defensive security

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,800
versus someone in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other track</font>

8
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,930
presenting offense you tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know that</font>

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,140
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> person probably has the sexier</font>

10
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,820
talk but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay ah and truthfully</font>

11
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> experience has been not many people</font>

12
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,570
know what docker is yet since it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

13
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,940
relatively new so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk a</font>

14
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,369
little bit about docker today and set

15
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:23,509
the stage for how you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

16
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:25,250
using it within your enterprise so as I

17
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,869
mentioned my name is Greg rice I work as

18
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,050
a principal cyber security engineer

19
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:33,200
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my official job title principal</font>

20
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:36,350
really just means<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spend less of my</font>

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,150
time actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> within an IDE today and</font>

22
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,910
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my time with in Word and</font>

23
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:46,130
PowerPoint trying to convince<font color="#CCCCCC"> people of</font>

24
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:49,220
my ideas so that they give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> money my</font>

25
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,470
focus in my job is in research and

26
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,640
development so unlike some of the people

27
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,640
here today that are really in the

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,700
trenches and and doing real security

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,210
work going out performing Incident

30
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:05,810
Response doing malware analysis securing

31
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,419
networks administering firewalls I'm

32
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:12,819
more focused on the creation of new

33
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:16,790
security technologies so my focus is

34
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:21,109
particularly in embedded systems my

35
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:22,970
interests are in critical systems that

36
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,580
are employed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the Internet of</font>

37
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,950
Things where those systems are either

38
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,890
legacy and now just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being connected to</font>

39
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:33,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet or secondly they may be</font>

40
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,708
systems that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to come out of</font>

41
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:39,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">the factory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and be deployed out in a</font>

42
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">real world environment for 25 or 30</font>

43
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,190
years right we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have the</font>

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,590
option to be able to quickly deploy

45
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,050
patches to these so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are hard</font>

46
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,180
research problems that I like to tackle

47
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,240
today I maintain several patents on

48
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,060
security technologies I joy the work I

49
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,650
do but

50
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,380
I like coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> into conferences like this</font>

51
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,900
where I meet a lot more people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

52
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,069
focused on the day-to-day security and

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:09,569
not and not don't get focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

54
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:11,670
academic security discussions so the

55
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:14,010
focus of my talk today again is docker a

56
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,988
little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this will be dr. 101 in</font>

57
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,390
other words we I want to be able to set

58
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:21,269
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stage for what is darker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and how can</font>

59
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:26,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it secondly we'll talk a little</font>

60
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:28,230
bit about docker using docker for

61
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:31,040
resource isolation using dr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

62
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:34,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">advantage of security on your systems</font>

63
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,798
third we'll talk a little bit about how

64
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:40,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">I leverage dr. sort of as a hacker as</font>

65
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,970
being able to leverage some of the

66
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,830
docker repositories and be able to

67
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,859
quickly set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> development environments</font>

68
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,840
that I can leverage so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. well</font>

69
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,940
it's an open platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">platform for deployment and management</font>

71
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:58,680
of containerized software services it

72
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,500
really consists of two parts one is that

73
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,010
the actual docker engine this is my

74
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">runtime Damon allowing me to to provide</font>

75
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,328
a framework for bringing up and

76
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:13,530
executing containers and being able to

77
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:16,680
manage those containers secondly it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

78
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,930
hub or our repository for vetted

79
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,478
containers within the community that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

80
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,930
can quickly pull and be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get up</font>

81
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:28,260
and working so you'll notice today I

82
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,919
mentioned docker hub is really just a

83
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,450
cloud repository of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready-to-use</font>

84
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:37,409
containers so think of this is sort of

85
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:39,450
like just pulling from from github right

86
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,520
I find a software package on github I

87
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,770
like I can pull it down I can be up and

88
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">running with it very quickly or like app</font>

89
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:50,430
get right if you're you work in the

90
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">Debian in Pilot debian environments app</font>

91
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,000
get is a really convenient mean so

92
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,680
quickly pulling down a package and

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,090
having it up and running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your linux</font>

94
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,090
distribution break quickly

95
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,370
so when I say containers today what I'm

96
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">really talking about our docker</font>

97
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:14,069
containers a docker container<font color="#E5E5E5"> is largely</font>

98
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:16,568
built on lube container a

99
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:18,870
containerization technology built by

100
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google around two thousand seven or so a</font>

101
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,500
container is really just a lightweight

102
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,299
virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment right we</font>

103
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,310
normally talk when we talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs</font>

104
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,319
today we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things big</font>

105
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,750
beefy virtual machines right entire

106
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,509
operating system images that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

107
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run on top of a hypervisor but a</font>

108
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:39,490
container is really just a lightweight

109
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:42,970
virtualization but it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a lot of</font>

110
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,310
additional security here because I'm

111
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:48,009
allowed to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start to restrict</font>

112
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,289
what sort of resources are available for

113
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:53,190
that container so this includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

114
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:56,680
like what's my available<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU bandwidth</font>

115
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,930
what is my maximum memory limit for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

116
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,539
system what network interfaces are

117
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,840
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it what software is going</font>

118
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:07,960
to run within this container and I do

119
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,539
that in docker largely through as I

120
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,609
mentioned before<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lib container and</font>

121
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,830
control groups or C groups and Linux

122
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:19,030
namespaces control groups or what<font color="#CCCCCC"> allow</font>

123
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">me to actually limit the resources to a</font>

124
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:25,119
container namespaces with in lenox<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

125
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,889
what allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to essentially allow one</font>

126
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,570
container to talk to another in other

127
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:31,419
words it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to define that</font>

128
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:34,479
interface between containers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is to</font>

129
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:38,650
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring up one virtualized</font>

130
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,990
container that operates a sequel a

131
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,419
sequel server and another virtualized

132
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,370
container that operates something like

133
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:47,080
Apache right if I'm starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

134
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:53,740
an environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I want to be able</font>

135
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:55,750
to run a something like a lamp server so

136
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,060
the switch should sound pretty familiar

137
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:02,229
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just presented</font>

138
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:05,159
on sandboxing technology things like

139
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:07,719
jails have been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a long time</font>

140
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">chroot was very popular particularly in</font>

142
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,040

time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dr.</font>

144
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,200
was originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> built on lenox containers</font>

145
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,060
today it's as i mentioned built on lib

146
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,210
container the technology developed by

similar right this technology has been

around for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while in that sense but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what I like about containers is that</font>

153
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:42,120
they're very lightweight again with a

154
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,409
when I virtualize an entire vm I'm

155
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,960
virtualizing in this case an entire

156
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:49,540
guest operating system right and we've

157
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,719

VMs but<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vm that's a lot of overhead</font>

173
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,669
right I have a hypervisor running now I

174
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,929
have to I have to virtualize that entire

175
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:40,598
guest OS infrastructure whereas in the

176
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:43,839
darker world all I really care about is

177
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,910
a particular service a software service

178
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,180
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> running so that could be</font>

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:53,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">something as simple as let's say running</font>

180
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,089
Apache or I'll give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an example</font>

181
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,850
recently of a case where I brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

182
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,500
docker to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> something the CDC if</font>

State<font color="#CCCCCC"> University the cyber defense</font>

185
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,310
competition there every year distributes

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,670
essentially a web application to all of

187
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:13,000
the the red team so you have the code to

188
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,740
run in advance the event and start to

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,010
poke around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for web application</font>

190
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:20,440
vulnerabilities put every semester that

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,260
seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that web application</font>

192
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:27,850
changes dramatically so sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

193
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,390
just a PHP web page this<font color="#E5E5E5"> past time it</font>

194
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,600
wasn't

195
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,600
le written in Django and I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a</font>

196
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,970
hacker and I'm like wow man I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

197
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,530
anything about Django all right I'm

198
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,300
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn right I love learning</font>

199
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,360
new things I'll go off and I'll start to

200
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">learn about this but man I gotta get up</font>

201
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,470
in a django environment now what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

202
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,740
after this competition I don't want that

203
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,870
sitting around and running so you know

204
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,500
it could be something where I'd spin up

205
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,750
a vm put it all on the vm and once I'm

206
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,690
once once it's over and I'm finished

207
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,550
testing I blow away the vm but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

208
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,580
that's a lot of overhead I<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta wait</font>

209
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:09,339
for that vm to boot I have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

210
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:12,010
that I have all the dependencies within

211
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,840
that environment I have to get Django up

212
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:16,390
and running within that vm that's that

213
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,490
takes a lot of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and energy it takes</font>

214
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:22,569
a lot of computing time I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

215
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,970
something much more lightweight so this

216
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:28,990
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where containers become so useful</font>

217
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:31,810
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still have the isolation of a</font>

218
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:36,100
virtual machine I still largely have

219
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:39,280
that isolation but I'm only concerned

220
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:43,200
with virtualizing just the service that

221
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to run now you might argue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

222
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,400
in this case you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not you don't have</font>

223
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,020
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same security and and I would</font>

224
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,110
acknowledge that right there are certain

225
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:55,420
shared resources within a containerized

226
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,910
environment that are shared so for

227
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,959
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I point out a few here those</font>

228
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:04,260
include things like praxis proc irq some

229
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,830
of the the dev devices like some of the

230
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:11,410
dev SD devices are shared low-level

231
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:13,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">colonel functionality shared across the</font>

232
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,610
VMS right you're you're essentially

233
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,560
you're running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of the colonel so</font>

234
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:21,040
some of that is shared as well so for

235
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,890
things like any of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux drivers</font>

236
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,680
your lsm modules all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is shared</font>

237
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:30,160
so technically if you had a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> low</font>

238
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,479
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> colonel exploit this is something</font>

239
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,760
where you could break out of your

240
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,910
container but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it's it's really not</font>

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,890
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> colonel exploits here</font>

242
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,800
really what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be able to do is</font>

243
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:44,290
bring up quick environments

244
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,000
where you have virtualized services and

245
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:52,540
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring those up in a default</font>

246
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,670
and minimized<font color="#E5E5E5"> state so the doctor hasn't</font>

247
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,680
been around for that long in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I</font>

248
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,800
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people today about docker</font>

249
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:03,370
they've either heard of it and they're

fully committed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor or secondly</font>

252
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,180
they kind of know about it but they

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,510
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much about it other</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">than it's it's a container technology in</font>

256
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:21,790
all for about two years now so in

257
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:24,550
January 2013 duck cloud started a side

258
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:29,550
project that wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start to look at</font>

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:31,899
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> containerisation solutions that</font>

260
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,699
migrated into an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source project</font>

261
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:37,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was released just a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">later in March of 2013 that project was</font>

263

in fact in production at this point

268
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:56,380
despite it being so so relative in

269
00:12:53,380 --> 00:13:00,189
relative embassy you start to see a lot

270
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,860
of investment into this area<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">brings us even more recently to this</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of backing away with it and that's</font>

278
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:25,779
largely<font color="#E5E5E5"> because containers to date have</font>

been problematic they historically

00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:31,750
lacked a decent infrastructure right if

security and you looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> starting</font>

it took some configuration the

286
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,449
containers that you created were largely

287
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,550
matched to that particular distribution

and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is these are the sorts of</font>

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,240
problems the doctor wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

290
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,160
essentially tackle they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to focus</font>

291
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,240
on a very lightweight standardized

292
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,579
container that could

293
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,830
be taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one distribution to</font>

294
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,959
another and there should be no worry

295
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,480
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developer on whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

296
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,969
that technology would work likewise they

297
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,100
wanted to focus on that state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

298
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,830
resource isolation making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

299
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:16,450
these particular software services only

300
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:19,990
operated within their their restricted

301
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:23,020
environments so today you see a broad

302
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,360
use of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dr.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is why I say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

303
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,550
been in the news a lot lately Red Hat

304
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,160
has is probably the largest adopter of

305
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,170
doctor today the Amazon clouds now

306
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,149
supports docker containers I no longer

307
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,949
have to worry about spinning up for

308
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:37,570
example a whole vm within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazon</font>

309
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">cloud i could be a lot more lightweight</font>

310
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:43,779
i can drop docker containers there

311
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,100
google has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been in the news again being</font>

312
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:48,520
the creator of the lib container

313
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,200
technology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doctor is based on has</font>

314
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,079
been in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> news recently for being a</font>

315
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,070
huge supporter of docker in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

316
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,089
a news clipping here that says Google

317
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:02,740
everything at Google runs within a

318
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:06,640
container<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spotify has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dr eyes much of</font>

319
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,829
their technology today<font color="#E5E5E5"> microsoft is</font>

320
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,630
fully investing in docker as well I'm

321
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:13,319
not quite certain what Microsoft is

322
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,850
actually strategically leveraging it for

323
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:20,529
that companies strategies never clear to

324
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:24,060
me like jumping into the smartphone

325
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:27,490
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that ship has sailed</font>

326
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:30,010
again docker consists largely of two

327
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:33,399
things one is the execution framework

328
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:36,790
the second is that cloud repository or

329
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,589
docker hub that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned before so</font>

330
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,529
the execution framework is where we

331
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:43,990
begin to set some of the stage for

332
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:46,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">managing containers again to date raw</font>

333
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,470
containers were always very difficult to

334
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,610
manage they weren't standardized I

335
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,430
couldn't just<font color="#CCCCCC"> take them from one</font>

336
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,260
distribution to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other docker aims to</font>

337
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:57,339
tackle that<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem by making deployment</font>

338
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:59,230
very very easy so what I really like

339
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:02,950
about docker and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I first</font>

340
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:06,880
started to to start to use it I had this

341
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:08,800
this problem of portability I was

342
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,980
working on a major program where

343
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,430
we had maybe six different companies

344
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:17,589
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 disjoint software services and</font>

345
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,410
we needed to integrate all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them into</font>

346
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:22,269
one common solution each of our services

347
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:25,089
were providing an integral part of that

348
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:29,709
system but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know somebody's running</font>

349
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:31,630
on fedora another person's running on an

350
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:34,689
old version of debian another person's

351
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,459
running on bsd right we have all of

352
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">these different services all of these</font>

353
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:40,449
different dependencies and we just need

354
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,709
to start to bring them together into one

355
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:47,200
rack and so the practical way to do that

356
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:49,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the time was just to spin up lots and</font>

357
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots and lots of VMs so i can remember</font>

358
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,300
heading out to the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the first</font>

359
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:57,010
integration exercises and i brought tons

360
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,589
and tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> disks with me because all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

361
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,510

362
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:02,980
I was focused on on bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and</font>

363
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,379
making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had environments with</font>

364
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,870
all of my dependencies<font color="#CCCCCC"> built-in and this</font>

365
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,520
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really no different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from within the</font>

366
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:12,550
security arena especially as you think

367
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:16,119
about supporting multiple different

368
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:21,309
deployments right you have your cluster

369
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:23,229
maybe for developers you have a backup

370
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:25,780
recovery site where you want to be able

371
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to quickly deploy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to in the case of a</font>

372
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">major incident right all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

373
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,260
they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use different hardware they</font>

374
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:34,149
have different dependencies and so we

375
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,220
end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a lot of distributions that</font>

376
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,190
we have to manage over time and this

377
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,660
becomes particularly problematic not

378
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">only to manage functionally button</font>

379
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:47,500
security as well if I have lots and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots</font>

380
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">of different OS distributions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VMs that</font>

381
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,910
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> operating right there's a lot of</font>

382
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:53,200
overhead in terms of patch management

383
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,179
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that those are adequately</font>

384
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,040
backed up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> our snapshot it over time</font>

385
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:59,169
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> types of</font>

386
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,559
operating systems that I have to to

387
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:04,210
manage I'm starting to worry about some

388
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,460
of the real resource requirements as

389
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,140
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> right VMs are very heavy and that's</font>

390
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:12,100
what we drove into on this on this

391
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:14,200
particular program we had rack after

392
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,678
rack after rack<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just wasting</font>

393
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:21,940
large quantities of computing power on

394
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,659
virtualizing entire os's so our focus

395
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,369
their will

396
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:27,999
as well we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that was more</font>

397
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:30,099
standardized and someone offered the

398
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:31,809
idea of hey I've read about dr. in the

399
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:33,309
news maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should check it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and so</font>

400
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:37,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was code of what initially sparked</font>

401
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:40,899
my my interest in this area docker as

402
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:43,899
I'm as I've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of alluded to dr.</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

403
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:45,728
its name extends from this idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

404
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:47,889
shipping containers right a shipping

405
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:50,409
container standardized I can take a

406
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:54,789
container off of ship I can plop it on a

407
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:56,529
rail car I can put it on a truck right

408
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:58,629
that shipping container can go anywhere

409
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:00,340
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry about the platform</font>

410
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:02,859
that's transporting that shipping

411
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,189
container I merely need to track that

412
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:08,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">shipping container and where it's at and</font>

413
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,330
fill it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with good things and so darker</font>

414
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,149
takes that model takes that analogy and

415
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:15,158
starts to package up software services

416
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:17,439
within these containers such that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

417
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:21,700
could put them anywhere if it runs<font color="#CCCCCC"> lenox</font>

418
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,080
it can run a docker container as long as

419
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,759
that container is of the same

420
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:29,949
instruction set architecture as as the

421
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,169
the executing framework by that what I

422
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:35,950
mean is I can't take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> powerpoint or</font>

423
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:38,739
excuse me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerPC container and run it</font>

424
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:41,710
on an ARM processor I obviously can't

425
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:44,499
take an Intel container and run it on an

426
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,450
ARM processor right I have to have to

427
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:50,590
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to the the low-level</font>

428
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:54,340
machine architecture but I don't have to

429
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:58,869
worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're on ubuntu 12 I'm on</font>

430

of Hadoop there because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:06,970
dependency issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's unstable right I</font>

433
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:08,918
can Tanner eyes things the rest the rest

434
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">is all easy I don't have to worry about</font>

435
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:15,279
anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this this is what i</font>

436
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">love about docker even more than that</font>

437
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,109
the security aspect container

438
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,639
management's very easy what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do is</font>

439
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:25,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically set up a little bit of</font>

440
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:28,330
metadata that describes things like do I

441
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:30,429
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open up ports on this particular</font>

442
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,499
container what are its dependencies does

443
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,690
it depend on any other containers that I

444
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:36,890
have operating I gave the example of a

445
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:39,290
lamp server I can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> container</font>

446
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:42,110
where I've run one Apache in one

447
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:47,139
container I may run my sequel and

448
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:49,520
another I could run postgres and another

449
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">django and a completely other container</font>

450
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,530
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have the ability they're two</font>

451
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:58,429
separate things and then start to

452
00:20:54,530 --> 00:21:01,550
identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the minimal minimal</font>

453
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:04,280
communication mechanisms between these

454
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:06,560
containers so I bundle everything up and

455
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,020
now i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a very lightweight small</font>

456
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,600
container and i'm able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run that</font>

457
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,389
anywhere that that has the docker<font color="#CCCCCC"> damon</font>

458
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,629
running so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need today to get</font>

459
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:21,020
darker up and running<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is just</font>

460
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:22,820
that to pull the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> darker the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stalker</font>

461
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,129
execution framework and get it up and

462
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,050
running on my box after that things are

463
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:33,320
very very easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start and stop</font>

464
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:35,180
containers launching a container is

465
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,429
relatively easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's the doctor</font>

466
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,140
execution framework not only consists of

467
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,380
the daemon but a<font color="#CCCCCC"> command-line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> utility</font>

468
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:45,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that allows me to start and stop things</font>

469
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:49,580
very easily all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Damon's</font>

470
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:51,530
listen on a unix socket by default<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

471
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually configure that within</font>

472
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,730
production environments to listen to a

473
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP socket so i can actually issue all</font>

474
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:05,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these commands remotely as well it's</font>

475
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:08,750
very easy the<font color="#CCCCCC"> API is a bit has a bit of</font>

476
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:11,210
a learning curve but more recently as

477
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,460
we'll see later doctors purchased a

478
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:16,070
company called orchard that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a</font>

479
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:18,740
technology called fig that largely

480
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:21,610
focused on this idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I quickly</font>

481
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,560
and easily configure docker containers

482
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:29,600
so this has actually become

483
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:31,399
significantly easier over time so with

484
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,040
that in mind the doctor execution

485
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,590
framework is relatively straightforward

486
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,960
and easy today we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a demo here</font>

487
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,149
in a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes where we actually start</font>

488
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:46,430
to look at examples of that execution

489
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:48,260
framework so I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> docker consists</font>

490
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:50,390
of two parts one is the execution

491
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,810
framework again the second is

492
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:56,510
the docker hub the docker hub is

493
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:59,830
essentially my way of being able to

494
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:03,260
manage different containers in

495
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:05,720
particular the public docker hub or the

496
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,120
public docker repo allows me to quickly

497
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:12,820
pull containers that are pre-configured

498
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:15,290
and vetted by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community to be secure</font>

499
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,179
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can quickly pull those containers</font>

500
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:20,690
and get them up and running in my

501
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:24,070
environment that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very useful as a</font>

502
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:26,930
developer I gave the example before of

503
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:29,419
bringing up a CDC web server and

504
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,460
discovering all this news is Django I

505
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,560
don't have that installed and I don't

506
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,060
have to worry about for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

507
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:38,810
somebody gives me something to pen test

508
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,190
and it runs my sequel I don't have to

509
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:42,679
worry about all right well I got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

510
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:45,050
this my sequel database setup and I want

511
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure that you know I'm a</font>

512
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,500
security person so I tend to be anal if

513
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to bring up my sequel on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

514
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,130
particular box I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it to be I</font>

515
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secure even</font>

516
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,900
though I'm going to be poking around

517
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:59,420
their web app as part of this as part of

518
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,760
this pen test and when I'm done with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

519
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,340
I since I'm not using it anymore as a

520
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,690
developer I want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of there I don't</font>

521
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,459
want to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about all of that</font>

522
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,160
and that's what makes docker container

523
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,170
management they've made that

524
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:15,940
exceptionally easy what I do as a

525
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:21,050
developer today when someone gives me

526
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:24,620
new requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can quickly on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my on</font>

527
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:28,280
my within my development environment go

528
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:30,709
out and pull a container image from the

529
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,680
docker repo and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best part about this</font>

530
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,660
is that it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> not unlike at apt</font>

531
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,550
get in the sense that i could pull

532
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,470
something and it will figure out

533
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:43,820
dependencies based on the image on

534
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:46,310
pulling<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pull entire base</font>

535
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,350
operating system images within container

536
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:52,850
environments so you can pull for example

537
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:57,199
a virtualized ubuntu image today a

538
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:59,689
virtualized fedora image all from this

539
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,680
environment and be able to be quickly up

540
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,800
and running right away

541
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:08,400
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that as a developer now I can</font>

542
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:11,760
start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add my applications on top</font>

543
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,660
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so for example let's say I was</font>

544
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,270
too in my example earlier of the the CDC

545
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:22,110
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's running Django so I'm going</font>

546
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:24,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">to pull two probably two containers from</font>

547
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:27,149
the darker public registry the first one

548
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,640
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the Django container the</font>

549
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,310
second one I'm probably Django if you're

550
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,340
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it really is just a</font>

551
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:37,860
framework for doing web design in

552
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,449
conjunction with a sequel server so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

553
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,389
probably going to have to pull a sequel

554
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:46,290
server container as well I pull both of

555
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:48,390
those now I can start adding my ex my

556
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:51,360
proprietary content to those containers

557
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:54,570
so this in my case my example I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

558
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,629
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the CDC web server so i put</font>

559
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:59,310
that on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can add some metadata</font>

560
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:02,430
around that in other words how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

561
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:04,980
want that website to to auto auto run

562
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:07,050
each time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> launch this container maybe</font>

563
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,930
I set up some configuration settings

564
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:12,659
around it but at that point now i can if

565
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:16,110
i wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can push it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

566
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,940
our own internal docker registry you'll

567
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,669
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> here i'm using the terms push and</font>

568
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:24,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">pool when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i say dr. registry what I'm</font>

569
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:28,410
really referring to here is essentially

570
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:30,960
a get repo of container images now all

571
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:34,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what once once i have that internal</font>

572
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,840
repository any of the environments that

573
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">i operate in can easily just pull from</font>

574
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:44,939
that environment and as long as that

575
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:47,160
environment is running<font color="#CCCCCC"> lenox or has some</font>

576
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:51,720
variant of docker for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

577
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:55,290
run you can run this on<font color="#E5E5E5"> OSX they're able</font>

578
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,980
to quickly up get that container up and

579
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,850
running it's as easy as a as a get pool

580
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,710
assuming that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're running the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dr.</font>

581
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,780
Damon so this gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a lot of</font>

582
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,940
flexibility now I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry so</font>

583
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,770
much about dependencies right when i

584
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,710
started i can remember especially

585
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:13,980
developing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like web applications in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

586
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:15,630
late 90s and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> really web</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hosting</font>

587
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,260
providers at the time

588
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:21,450
just weren't ready for dynamic dynamic

589
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,270
content on board the web yet you know

590
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,130
you'd spend a lot of time on on the help

591
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,810
desk with with different individuals

592
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,460
because what they really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

593
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:32,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing they were configured for</font>

594
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,130
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time was hosting static HTML but</font>

595
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:40,170
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get work with web posters at</font>

596
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:42,360
the time to run things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like pearl on the</font>

597
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">website that was that was a difficult</font>

598
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,530
issue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had to walk people through</font>

599
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:49,290
all these dependencies now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

600
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:51,810
simple the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I can do in a</font>

601
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:55,980
cloud environment like Amazon right I

602
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:58,470
can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can pull directly from my my</font>

603
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,060
container registry pull container into

604
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:04,350
the Amazon Cloud and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that up and</font>

605
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:06,090
running very quickly so it's worth

606
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:10,020
talking a little bit about how to build

607
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:14,220
containers containers are composed<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

608
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:16,560
baseline image so this can be large or

609
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,260
small for example I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull something</font>

610
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:22,740
like let's say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

611
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:27,360
to operate PHP I can pull a small image

612
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:29,910
that simply gives me PHP the ability to

613
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,040
execute PHP and so there's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

614
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:36,600
least some base around that sometimes

615
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:40,770
that's a bit of a baseline file system I

616
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,540
could pull complete baseline operating

617
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,150
system images like for example I give

618
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:47,879
the in my sample here I have red hat

619
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:50,670
enterprise linux operating as my

620
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:55,080
baseline image<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can then add services</font>

621
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:57,660
on top of that container for example I

622
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:01,710
may want to run apache or something and

623
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:04,320
my finally i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can add my application on</font>

624
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,390
top of that container but what's nice

625
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,850
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that i can pull these</font>

626
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:12,060
standardized vetted containers again

627
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,490
from that the public docker repo that

628
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:17,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">gets me up and running very quickly the</font>

629
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:19,740
other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like about docker</font>

630
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:25,020
from a configuration management

631
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:27,309
perspective is the ability to quickly do

632
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:30,279
revision control here

633
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:33,879
in my earlier example where I'm sure I

634
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:37,210
have everything hosted as<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs once I've</font>

635
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:39,580
done with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that vm I take it down I can I</font>

636
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:41,230
can image it again I put it back on my

637
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:45,340
hardware at home and I start<font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

638
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:47,769
changes the next the next integration

639
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,928
event<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might go to now I gotta bake</font>

640
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:51,340
that take that whole vm with me again

641
00:29:49,929 --> 00:29:55,509
right I'm always I'm always concerned

642
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:57,309
with the revision over<font color="#E5E5E5"> snapshots so I</font>

643
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:59,740
tend to be pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> these large images</font>

644
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:01,990
whereas docker has a nice environment

645
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,749
where you're only really pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

646
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,610
the modification to these containers so

647
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:08,830
you'll see in the graphic here what I

648
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:12,189
have is a container in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top left</font>

649
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:15,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">corner I make a modification or two to</font>

650
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:19,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that container push it to my whatever my</font>

651
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:20,350
my container repository is now out in

652
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:22,210
the field within my development

653
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:25,330
environments I can quickly pull those

654
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,649
just those small modifications and get

655
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,658
those up and running within my

656
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:35,110
environment without having to move

657
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:36,669
around a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> container data so</font>

658
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,408
advantages of dr. particularly from a

659
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:40,659
security perspective one it's very

660
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:43,559
minimal right these containers the

661
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:47,409
baseline images they operate exclusively

662
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:53,408
what I you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to write if I pull</font>

663
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:55,960
a an image today let's say if I pull

664
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:57,940
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> apache i can define their</font>

665
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,600
the version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of apache that i want to run</font>

666
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:03,879
any but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i pull it it's going to run</font>

667
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,918
just apache if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to run something</font>

668
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:07,509
additional i have to define that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as part</font>

669
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,460
of my metadata right if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

670
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:10,950
Apache module that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run I have</font>

671
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:14,529
to define that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as part of my metadata</font>

672
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:18,220
they're very portable easy to share what

673
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:20,169
I really like is that they have a strong

674
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,269
separation and privileges all of that

675
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,950
this is relatively no but all of the

676
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:25,629
images are now being vetted by the

677
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:28,389
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure they don't have</font>

678
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:32,709
any sort of malicious content that

679
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:35,229
they're set up as secure by default you

680
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:37,179
have with<font color="#E5E5E5"> within these environments as</font>

681
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,820
I've pointed out before you have a

682
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:40,840
strong isolation as well right if I take

683
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,020
the time

684
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:47,620
to make sure that my containers are set

685
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,730
up with minimal resources any isolation

686
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,389
that I have of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font>

687
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:56,590
application it tends to be limited to

688
00:31:52,390 --> 00:32:00,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> containerized environment it's very</font>

689
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,449
fast to quickly deploy within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor</font>

690
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,279
environment right I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much</font>

691
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,039
worried about dependencies here<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr.</font>

692
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:09,179
takes care of all of that automatically

693
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:13,720
for me there's complete environments now

694
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:17,140
new systems based on docker that allow

695
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:20,470
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus on this deployment problem</font>

696
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:22,450
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example go CD go continuous</font>

697
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,880
deployment is a complete framework for

698
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly being able to test images within</font>

699
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,750
a development framework and then once

700
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,370
they once that you've gotten them

701
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:33,820
through security and regression testing

702
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:36,100
quickly pushing those out to out to

703
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,559
production there's other frameworks that

704
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,899
manage containers for you I'll allow you

705
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,809
to see images over time make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

706
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:50,500
you have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> baseline image contains</font>

707
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:55,418
everything that that you need so let's

708
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:57,159
let's get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more detailed so</font>

709
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:59,169
that we can do the demo here remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

710
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:02,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned before that any container</font>

711
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:04,990
contains a baseline image these are

712
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:07,360
baseline vetted images that I pull from

713
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:11,260
the docker hub so in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

714
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,809
from dockerfile tom cat app server right

715
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:17,110
so that's kind of my baseline image that

716
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:19,570
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to pull this is I want</font>

717
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:23,139
to be able to operate a tomcat server

718
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:26,279
within this environment I add the xik

719
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:29,440
web apps on top of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want to</font>

720
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:31,659
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to execute so right I</font>

721
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:36,130
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a baseline image that I'm</font>

722
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:39,250
assured has some security now I add my

723
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:44,409
ex my application on top of that so in

724
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:46,419
this case I say ed my web at war and now

725
00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:49,899
I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start exposing things from that</font>

726
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:51,610
container right by<font color="#E5E5E5"> default none of the</font>

727
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:53,620
ports on that container are exposed

728
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,550
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just it just brings a tomcat</font>

729
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,669
server up

730
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:58,899
it's running<font color="#E5E5E5"> with in net that</font>

731
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:01,150
virtualized<font color="#CCCCCC"> file system it's running</font>

732
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,520
within that container environment but

733
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:05,980
ideally I'd like to start exposing some

734
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,199
things right a web server is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

735
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,449
useful not very useful to me unless I

736
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:13,210
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually access it over a TCP port</font>

737
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:15,129
so here I expose<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> port 8080 what</font>

738
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:18,520
that essentially means is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

739
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,810
container<font color="#E5E5E5"> exposed port 8080 and in fact</font>

740
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,540
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> show it here but you can</font>

741
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:25,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually map that then to it can a port</font>

742
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:28,509
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> open on the the host operating</font>

743
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:31,629
system as well so in this case what I

744
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:34,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">might try to do is do an exposé 8080</font>

745
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:39,400
colon 8080 so that means I expose port

746
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:43,000
8080 on the container and have that open

747
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:45,790
on my base operating system as well this

748
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,179
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> exposing allows me to quickly</font>

749
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:53,500
configure how individual containers will

750
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:56,230
talk to one another over ports and I can

751
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:59,050
give it some initial commands to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

752
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:03,730
start processes within this container so

753
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:10,300
in my case I have a simple service kick

754
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:13,300
off and start the logging process now as

755
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,460
I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> before really when when</font>

756
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,410
docker first arrived on the scene it

757
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,880
wasn't particularly<font color="#CCCCCC"> user-friendly it had</font>

758
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,529
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment that was largely</font>

759
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,270
command-line driven you could do a lot

760
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,830
with in that environment but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> took you</font>

761
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:25,300
if you go through the doctor

762
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,690
documentation it all still exists today

763
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,550
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a ton of command line options</font>

764
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,140
it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like tackling net and map</font>

765
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,690
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time right and map has a</font>

766
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:36,640
ton of command line options it's hard to

767
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:41,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrap your mind around all of them</font>

768
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,569
quickly but fortunately there are

769
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:49,540
environments today that make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that very</font>

770
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:54,790
easy so today fig<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been integrated</font>

771
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:58,060
into docker it we call it now docker

772
00:35:54,790 --> 00:36:01,029
compose essentially what we what we do

773
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,710
is set up an environment define what we

774
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">in want our environment to look like</font>

775
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:08,230
within a llamo file and we can use that

776
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:11,680
to quickly deploy multiple

777
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:14,320
containers for dr. all using this this

778
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,029
fig environment or darker compose so

779
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,570
this makes things<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy so let me</font>

780
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you an example here of ammo file</font>

781
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:26,980
for for darker compose so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice</font>

782
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:30,040
here I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> 22 particular operating</font>

783
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:40,690
system images can we make this bigger I

784
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:44,369
wonder is that helpful so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have two</font>

785
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:47,650
images the first is the database image

786
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:50,200
so i define it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as being named DB the</font>

787
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:54,220
second one being the web image I I call

788
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:57,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">it a course web my database image is</font>

789
00:36:54,220 --> 00:37:00,250
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on the baseline image</font>

790
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:03,250
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> postgres notice in this case I don't</font>

791
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,900
get I could give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a version I don't so</font>

792
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:07,240
by default it's going to be the most

793
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,190
current what I'm saying here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is oh hey</font>

794
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,919
dr. I want you to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the docker</font>

795
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:14,140
hub to your public docker repository and

796
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,800
if I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> already have it grab the most</font>

797
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:20,368
up-to-date image for<font color="#CCCCCC"> postgres and within</font>

798
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,840
this database environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can set some</font>

799
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:25,450
environment variables<font color="#E5E5E5"> I set to silly</font>

800
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,369
silly ones here just the username and

801
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:29,980
password a user name of post grass

802
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:32,380
password of blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could set lots</font>

803
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,330
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm showing a very simplistic</font>

804
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,520
example i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can set lots of environment</font>

805
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:39,520
variables here for example default

806
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:45,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">database name and so on my second</font>

807
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,660
container is going to be a environment

808
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:52,330
the important thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> note here is that</font>

809
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">i set up a virtual file system so in</font>

810
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,900
this case I'm putting everything in web

811
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,589
so if you're familiar with jails and how

812
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:02,560
we limit file systems within jails here

813
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:06,660
I mount things on web right I'm limited

814
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:10,330
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this environment this mount for web I</font>

815
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:14,080
want my web environment here to operate

816
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:15,369
a django server it's going to so if

817
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're familiar with django basically</font>

818
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:20,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">Django's based in python so I call</font>

819
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:21,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python managed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pie I'm going to run a</font>

820
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,530
django server

821
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:26,828
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on the local host on</font>

822
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:29,349
port 8000 that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I need to open</font>

823
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:33,430
port 8000 on the container as well and

824
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:35,440
here I'm at port 8000 to port 8000 on

825
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:37,839
the local host that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

826
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,240
connecting on the local host to port

827
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:45,788
8000<font color="#E5E5E5"> passed directly to that container</font>

828
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,669
here I'm starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build on top of</font>

829
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:50,650
this concept of namespaces I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

830
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:54,510
able to link these containers in some

831
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:57,970
way right I've isolated my web container

832
00:38:54,510 --> 00:39:00,520
it operates within one docker container

833
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,839
but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right it's a django</font>

834
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,288
environment needs to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pool</font>

835
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:10,288
ideally from a sequel database I want it

836
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:10,289
to be linked and dependent upon a

837
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,549
different container in this case I'm

838
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:18,308
describing this link to be my database

839
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:21,940
container the database<font color="#E5E5E5"> is defined here</font>

840
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:26,020
so that is to say now if I launch the

841
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:28,630
web container I the web container will

842
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:31,660
automatically launch then the database

843
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:35,980
container to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to actually operate</font>

844
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:37,808
within this within this framework again

845
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,789
the important thing to remember here

846
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:42,339
from a security perspective though is

847
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:45,130
that each of these operate within an

848
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:47,619
individual container there's a zero-day

849
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:53,020
discovered tomorrow for<font color="#CCCCCC"> postgres right</font>

850
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:55,059
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone was to let's say somehow I</font>

851
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,069
haven't really exposed anything here so

852
00:39:55,059 --> 00:40:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe this is a bad example but if</font>

853
00:39:57,069 --> 00:40:04,440
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to say let's let's say</font>

854
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,629
compromised a postgres because I I

855
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,520
expose something more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

856
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:11,619
right there limited their attack is

857
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,170
limited to that environment right

858
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:16,569
breaking out of that container is going

859
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:20,099
to require potentially a low-level

860
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:20,099
exploit oops

861
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:27,150
so let's switch over to a demo then what

862
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:30,299
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do in this demo is really</font>

863
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:32,249
demonstrate the two features of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. so</font>

864
00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:36,029
in one case what I'm going to do is do a

865
00:40:32,249 --> 00:40:39,569
simple pool from the docker public

866
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:41,819
repository to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a full image up and</font>

867
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:45,859
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case it's going to be a</font>

868
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:48,150
simple image I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run a</font>

869
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:49,469
simple application the hello world

870
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:51,599
application right where we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

871
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:55,049
familiar with as at<font color="#E5E5E5"> software developers</font>

872
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:58,529
but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run that on top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

873
00:40:55,049 --> 00:41:00,630
bun to baseline image my second case is

874
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:02,279
that the one that I've mentioned here

875
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,140
before I want to operate Django and

876
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:13,589
sequel within both container

877
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:20,209
environments so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kick off I wonder</font>

878
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:20,209
if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make this bigger easier</font>

879
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:44,150
alright so what I'm going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> here it</font>

880
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:47,390
actually let's do this if I say docker

881
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:49,820
images this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> show the images that i</font>

882
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:53,839
presently have installed so the first

883
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:55,850
one here is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> python image notice here</font>

884
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:59,750
I'm not running the latest instance of

885
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:03,560
Python I don't know many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

886
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:06,380
actually program in python 3 point<font color="#E5E5E5"> X so</font>

887
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,509
I'm running Python 2.7 I have a postgres

888
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,980
container as well so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are my docker</font>

889
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:11,900
images these are things that I've pulled

890
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,460
from the repository there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one more at</font>

891
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,710
the top that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've built dr.</font>

892
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that web for this particular demo</font>

893
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:20,630
and you can see their virtual sides

894
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,340
there on on the right and the time when

895
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:24,320
they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> created so this isn't the time</font>

896
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,750
its point point out here these are the

897
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,310
time that when I created them on my

898
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,410
system this is the time that they were

899
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:35,270
created on the docker hub repository

900
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:37,879
soap aight the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> python image was last</font>

901
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:42,670
updated with system updates two weeks

902
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:46,190
ago same thing goes for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for postgres</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

903
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:48,950
want to be able to run hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and</font>

904
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:51,710
so to do that what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to do if i</font>

905
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:56,109
switch over to my other tab here i'm

906
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:59,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to create a command say dr. run in</font>

907
00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:01,190
this case and this is this is this is

908
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I really love about docker right</font>

909
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,040
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to say I don't I haven't</font>

910
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:06,050
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything else yet I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

911
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,940
say docker run I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tell it when</font>

912
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:10,700
I wanted to run in this case I want a

913
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:14,960
containerized image of baseline you bunt

914
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:17,089
to 1404 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to once you bring</font>

915
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,000
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that baseline image what I want</font>

916
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:21,650
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just echo hello world so</font>

917
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,560
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to kick this off remember</font>

918
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:27,380
though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have an image for you</font>

919
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:30,049
bunt to 1404 so what happens then it

920
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:33,080
says well I can't find it so I'm going

921
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:35,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get it so at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this point</font>

922
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:38,150
it's downloading an image and it's a big

923
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:40,040
image so let's let's switch gears we'll

924
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:43,400
come back to it in a minute both switch

925
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:47,580
gears and we'll come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and check on</font>

926
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:50,380
that no it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not but</font>

927
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:58,049
I'm not I'm not I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

928
00:43:50,380 --> 00:44:01,120
comedy well here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a question yep</font>

929
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:05,860
so that's important to note like so for

930
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:09,880
example this laptop I bought off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ebay</font>

931
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:12,610
used five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago normally the laptops</font>

932
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,410
i use i just use ones for work this is a

933
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:18,430
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm personally doing</font>

934
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:23,710
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> brought my personal laptop old that</font>

935
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:25,480
top it's a core two duo not much<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM the</font>

936
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:28,600
thought of running a vm on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this laptop</font>

937
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,430
would scare me at this point the laptops

938
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,420
probably on the order of like seven I

939
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:36,339
mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know seven eight years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

940
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,200
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very beefy and you'll notice</font>

941
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:41,160
any of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> speakers today when they</font>

942
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,810
switch to VMS particularly like a pic on

943
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:46,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">andrew this morning he tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

944
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:51,160
switch from his base operating system OS

945
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:53,410
X to a fedora core image and his demo

946
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,690
particularly early on was very slow

947
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:57,580
because really you know a laptop right

948
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,410
and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new laptop doesn't have a</font>

949
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:03,540
whole lot of processing power for a

950
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">complete virtual machine infrastructure</font>

951
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,630
the switch oh yeah I did let's the

952
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:14,920
others doing oh it did actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

953
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:19,120
now so that downloaded you bunt to and

954
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:21,670
did staying it ran hello world um right

955
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:24,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">all within a few minutes I brought up an</font>

956
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:26,830
entire environment at baseline you bunt

957
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:30,790
to image without having to go through a

958
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:34,060
process of spinning up a vm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and letting</font>

959
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:36,130
that for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to boot installing from</font>

960
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:39,520
the baseline image let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm booting</font>

961
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:40,840
up the vm off of a standard iso<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk</font>

962
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,110
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to go through the process of</font>

963
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:46,180
installing now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to eventually go</font>

964
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:48,610
through the app get update all that's

965
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,950
been done for me I've pulled the most

966
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:52,750
recent App get updated you blunt to

967
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:55,120
image from doc from the docker

968
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:57,190
repository online<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've run my</font>

969
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:01,118
command and I can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this more</font>

970
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:04,230
interactive so now if i do like

971
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:09,309
images all right well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see that I have</font>

972
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:11,109
you want to installed now it's tagged as

973
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:15,309
a number of different things such as 14

974
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:16,808
0 for 14 0 for 2 or latest<font color="#CCCCCC"> trusty so</font>

975
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:19,180
they've tagged it here as a number of

976
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:21,849
different things but it's really all the

977
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,980
same image here you notice if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look at</font>

978
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:27,039
the image ID all of these point

979
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:29,680
essentially do the same thing and it's

980
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:31,809
relatively small I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually make</font>

981
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,519
this is this is useful to me when i'm

982
00:46:31,809 --> 00:46:36,490
debugging applications that are running

983
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:39,160
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of a docker container I can make</font>

984
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:41,109
this more interactive as well so what

985
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,019
I'm going to do now is say dr. run same

986
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:45,308
command as before only<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case I'm</font>

987
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:47,819
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open up I want this to be</font>

988
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:50,049
interactive I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to open up and run</font>

989
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:52,509
essentially going to run a terminal so

990
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:55,359
instead of running echo hello world I'm

991
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:58,089
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open up a bash prompt and in</font>

992
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:00,759
this case I've set this up with the

993
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:03,730
commands such that we open up a root

994
00:47:00,759 --> 00:47:05,200
prompt so notice there boom up and

995
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">running right away right i don't have to</font>

996
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,609
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> that penalty anymore of downloading</font>

997
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:12,339
image I'm up and running within that

998
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:15,249
environment in a shell right away and so

999
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:18,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">now I can start to to poke around here</font>

1000
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:20,499
and I have a fool a fool up essentially

1001
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:22,598
since i'm running a baseline you bunt to

1002
00:47:20,499 --> 00:47:26,410
image<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a full essentially</font>

1003
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:34,680
containerized image of you bunt<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let's</font>

1004
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:40,960
exit out of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let's do</font>

1005
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:45,009
one last<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and that is yes very</font>

1006
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:49,420
easily exceptionally easily so in this

1007
00:47:45,009 --> 00:47:51,549
case now right i have i have now for

1008
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:54,369
images my you bunt to image my postgres

1009
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:56,140
image my python image dr. test web let's

1010
00:47:54,369 --> 00:48:03,640
get rid of docker test web and build<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1011
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:05,739
from scratch so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to remove what</font>

1012
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:09,819
is it d 6 you can also just give the

1013
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:12,089
name oops I probably I'm still running

1014
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:20,140
something

1015
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:24,700
so let's do probably have it in my

1016
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:31,049
history somewhere yeah there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

1017
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:31,049
stop the images I'm running come on

1018
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:39,700
oops

1019
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,620
you

1020
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:58,000
helps if I spell it correctly all right

1021
00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:01,720
let's get rid of stuff and I'm going to

1022
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,059
get rid of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one container alright so</font>

1023
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,098
now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do a docker images I should see</font>

1024
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:09,910
I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to postgres</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Python you</font>

1025
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:11,200
bunt to the question for those of you on

1026
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,839
the video recording is kind of quickly

1027
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,250
layer things on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so in this</font>

1028
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,308
case i have i've already pulled two

1029
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:20,289
images one just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> python image all i can</font>

1030
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:22,270
do there is run<font color="#E5E5E5"> python code the other</font>

1031
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:26,260
one just a Postgres database all<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

1032
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:27,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">do there is operate a database but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1033
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,569
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to quickly layer things</font>

1034
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:35,670
on top of this so enter my llamo file

1035
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:38,020
again this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one I had earlier</font>

1036
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:39,579
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start out with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> llamo file then</font>

1037
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:43,650
we'll look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the docker file and my</font>

1038
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:47,440
requirements file so in my llamo file<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1039
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:49,510
have a data I create an image here

1040
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,380
called database it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be based</font>

1041
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:55,150
on postgres and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up some</font>

1042
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:57,609
environment variables again<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a</font>

1043
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,890
second image it's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> called web</font>

1044
00:49:57,609 --> 00:50:03,009
this is the one that I'm building it's

1045
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:06,129
linked or based on this database image

1046
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:10,000
and notice here I call out a command

1047
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:15,460
Python so docker now knows that well

1048
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:17,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it we're essentially going</font>

1049
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:21,880
to need Python within this environment I

1050
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:23,020
can contrast that with my docker file

1051
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,940
maybe I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have started with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1052
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:29,920
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> within my dockerfile i notice that</font>

1053
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:33,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to start i'm going to create</font>

1054
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:36,609
my new image from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python 2.7</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> image</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1055
00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:38,109
could set environment variables but what

1056
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:40,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">i really want to do is set up my virtual</font>

1057
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:41,980
file system within that that image so

1058
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:44,618
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a directory here</font>

1059
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:46,660
called web<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to set that as my</font>

1060
00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:48,849
virtual file system I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to add a</font>

1061
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,368
file within this directory called

1062
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:53,319
requirements that<font color="#CCCCCC"> text to web and now I</font>

1063
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:55,750
can this run command essentially allows

1064
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:56,779
me to run particular Linux commands

1065
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,760
within that container

1066
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:02,720
so it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did was make a</font>

1067
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:05,480
virtual file system a cake a folder set

1068
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:11,109
that as my essentially my work folder

1069
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:13,700
remember I essentially root filesystem

1070
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:16,160
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add within this container</font>

1071
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:19,939
requirements text and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to</font>

1072
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:22,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">do a python install to requirement of</font>

1073
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:26,200
requirements text there so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

1074
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,200
requirements text<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1075
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:34,040
what I do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements that text</font>

1076
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:36,740
right my baseline Python image is just

1077
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,200
Python I don't have any of the like any

1078
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:42,290
of the pipe I modules that that I might

1079
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,660
want as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my baseline Python</font>

1080
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:48,050
installed but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> running Django so I'm</font>

1081
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:52,700
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to need Django and in this case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1082
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:56,090
add an in another module so what I have

1083
00:51:52,700 --> 00:52:00,379
at this point is a docker file that says

1084
00:51:56,090 --> 00:52:03,980
create an image from called pipe from

1085
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:08,060
Python create this virtual file system

1086
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:11,240
and install these additional python

1087
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:13,520
modules within that environment my fig

1088
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:18,290
environment now I start to build on top

1089
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:20,240
of that image so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I set my my build</font>

1090
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:22,730
environment as dots so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font>

1091
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,410
to look at that docker file here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1092
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:25,760
command I want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run once that</font>

1093
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:28,069
containers<font color="#CCCCCC"> launched so I'm going to</font>

1094
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,290
actually open up my django interface is

1095
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:31,340
the volume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went to Mount I point</font>

1096
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:33,320
to the same thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had before</font>

1097
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:36,920
that's the web I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open up one</font>

1098
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:40,190
port and I want this to be based on the

1099
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:47,410
database as well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular image</font>

1100
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:50,480
so now with compose oops with compose

1101
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:54,170
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do now is kick this off and</font>

1102
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:57,590
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually create so I'm going to</font>

1103
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:59,210
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. compose right I've been using</font>

1104
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:02,480
docker compose and fig and

1105
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:04,010
interchangeably dagger composes my my

1106
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,850
finger environment what I want this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1107
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:09,590
do is run the web image so it's going to

1108
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:11,750
have to build that first

1109
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:14,900
and when I initially wanted to do is

1110
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:16,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">just kick off that that baseline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Django</font>

1111
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,170
framework if you're familiar with Django

1112
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:21,590
basically what i'm doing here is saying

1113
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:24,080
create a default<font color="#E5E5E5"> website within whatever</font>

1114
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:30,350
volume that I mount you in in this case

1115
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:31,970
web so kick this off now<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice the</font>

1116
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:34,430
first thing it did here is said I need

1117
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:36,980
Python Python was already there<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wasn't</font>

1118
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:38,810
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait for us to download</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i set</font>

1119
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:41,690
up an environment variable<font color="#CCCCCC"> within python</font>

1120
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:44,299
so i modified the image slightly create

1121
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:47,420
a directory called web set that as my

1122
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:49,190
default working directory now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> added</font>

1123
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:52,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that requirements file now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

1124
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:53,570
installing all of those python modules

1125
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:55,370
within that environment so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font>

1126
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:57,350
installed one now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've installed Django</font>

1127
00:53:55,370 --> 00:54:01,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right I've successfully built this</font>

1128
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:04,040
oh I forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to delete something first</font>

1129
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:08,359
that's probably okay though let's do

1130
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:09,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again i forgot to clean up you know</font>

1131
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,820
you always do these things where it's

1132
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:16,910
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to test this so many</font>

1133
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:21,560
times and i did so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i tested it oops but</font>

1134
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:28,640
what I forgot to do is clean<font color="#CCCCCC"> up my prior</font>

1135
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:34,130
tests so let's remove that and we'll

1136
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:36,560
remove manage yes so all I've done right

1137
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:39,800
now what I just did was remove the

1138
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,270
default django website that I told it to

1139
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">install because it started to build it</font>

1140
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:45,110
the last thing it did was start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

1141
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:48,169
that command to build the default django

1142
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:51,590
website and it said I can't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm</font>

1143
00:54:48,170 --> 00:55:01,190
just going to the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we should</font>

1144
00:54:51,590 --> 00:55:05,720
do here oops is go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and pull that</font>

1145
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:08,210
container oops we'll build it from

1146
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:10,689
scratch again since it's so fast so i

1147
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:10,690
can type

1148
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:26,780
so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been typing the ID before you</font>

1149
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:32,780
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also just type the name dr. test web</font>

1150
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:32,780
it'll pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all right let's try again</font>

1151
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,570
so grab that environment start building

1152
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:41,399
on top of the environment now I'm going

1153
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:43,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to install those python modules first</font>

1154
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:47,850
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I download is Django second one I</font>

1155
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:49,890
download is psycho PG I'm in running the

1156
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:54,390
the set up now for psycho PG so I'm

1157
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:57,319
building<font color="#CCCCCC"> that container so you'll notice</font>

1158
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:59,460
here it's it's this is what I really I

1159
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,140
continue to stress this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I really</font>

1160
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:04,020
love about it is that I'm up and running

1161
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:06,810
within a framework that I want for my

1162
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:10,140
penetration test very quickly so now

1163
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:13,230
I've successfully built my container<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr.</font>

1164
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:14,940
compose or fig makes this launching<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1165
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:17,390
container exceptionally easy if you look

1166
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:20,730
in my environment now I have that docker

1167
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:25,410
file and docker composed llamo dagger

1168
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:29,640
composed sort of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a make file if I</font>

1169
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:31,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">call docker compose run this will</font>

1170
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,750
essentially run the doctor compose file

1171
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:40,700
within this directory so i'll say darker

1172
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:40,700
compose run oops what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do wrong its</font>

1173
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,730
start

1174
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:01,240
up I was typed wrong alright so the

1175
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:04,210
first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does is bring up my</font>

1176
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:06,819
database remember the database is what I

1177
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:10,150
have to is what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> base my link on now I</font>

1178
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:12,250
start the other container web so my

1179
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:13,860
database comes up you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice it's</font>

1180
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:18,580
just called database one at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

1181
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:21,520
database automatically started now my

1182
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:23,620
web application starts so now if I open

1183
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:28,360
remember I match my container to port

1184
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:32,549
8000 on my on my pc or on my laptop so

1185
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:36,580
now if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to local host port 8000 I</font>

1186
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:40,240
should yep yet here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my default django</font>

1187
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:42,130
web page now it<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did a</font>

1188
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,649
pen test<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would spend a lot of time</font>

1189
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:46,750
creating baseline operating systems

1190
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:49,480
installing VMS trying to match my

1191
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:51,460
environment if I wanted to if I had

1192
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,020
source I'd want to get that source up

1193
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:55,120
and running so that I could internally

1194
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:59,290
play with it you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

1195
00:57:55,120 --> 00:58:01,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">anymore there's no reason to to spend as</font>

1196
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:04,779
much time as we do building up these

1197
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,279
large virtual operating system

1198
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:09,340
infrastructures when things are so

1199
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:11,470
neatly<font color="#E5E5E5"> containerized with docker that's</font>

1200
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:15,190
why this technology is catching on so

1201
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:17,790
fast again you know I've spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

1202
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:21,310
of the past I don't know a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

1203
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:24,190
learning about docker and using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for</font>

1204
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:26,860
projects at work when I meet people

1205
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:28,960
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> docker there either</font>

1206
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:30,850
they've either used it and they start to

1207
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,700
see the benefits<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there they fully</font>

1208
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:37,930
latch<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to it or they just they haven't</font>

1209
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:41,140
yet and so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't they haven't</font>

1210
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:43,569
drank the kool-aid doctor has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1211
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:45,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that I find I find especially</font>

1212
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:48,640
with fig or darker composed very easy to

1213
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:50,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">use there's lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of online tutorials in</font>

1214
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,859
fact if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to dr dot io the main</font>

1215
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">website they have an interactive</font>

1216
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">command-line utility with little</font>

1217
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:59,350
assignments that you can step through in

1218
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,250
terms of the tutorial to get up and

1219
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:04,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with docker right</font>

1220
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:07,850
I depending on the operating system that

1221
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:10,180
you use it can be either easy or hard to

1222
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">get up and running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the docker Damon</font>

1223
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:16,759
for example I'm running I run mint on my

1224
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:20,509
laptop mint is debian-based you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1225
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:22,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">nap get install of docker it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1226
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:26,380
old since its debian-based so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

1227
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:29,299
recommend pulling directly from github

1228
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:32,630
if you're on fedora relatively easy to

1229
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:34,820
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you just do a yum install if</font>

1230
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:36,560
you're on Mac OS you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font>

1231
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:38,630
docker within that environment as well I

1232
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:41,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't played I'm not Mac van so I</font>

1233
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:45,320
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> played with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't I can't</font>

1234
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:48,950
attest to its its maturity there the

1235
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:52,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">other thing I haven't found you you can</font>

1236
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:54,109
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> so last night that at dinner someone</font>

1237
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:56,660
asked me when I was telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> them about</font>

1238
00:59:54,110 --> 01:00:01,400
this talk have you have you spun up

1239
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:02,480
containers at all to try to do malware

1240
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,050
analysis right everything's

1241
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,700
containerized and you can actually spin

1242
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:11,780
up environments like cuckoo within

1243
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:15,950
within docker containers typically

1244
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:19,220
though with malware analysis it I it's

1245
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:21,740
generally better to run with a virtual

1246
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:23,689
opera complete guest virtual operating

1247
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:25,549
system right you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

1248
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:28,430
mirror that environment as much as

1249
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:29,840
possible as you're doing as you're as

1250
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:32,509
you're trying to reverse engineer a

1251
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,830
particular piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new malware so it's</font>

1252
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:36,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">the only way the only thing that I</font>

1253
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:43,509
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> found it useful for as as as a</font>

1254
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:43,510
as a developer questions at all yeah

1255
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:57,529
good question<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know because</font>

1256
01:00:55,580 --> 01:01:00,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've never actually I've been primarily</font>

01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:01,610
using it within development environments

1258
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:04,490
at this point I haven't used it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1259
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:07,070
the case of a full deployment so far

1260
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:09,410
where I was concerned with egress I

1261
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:10,850
don't know I'd have to I'd have to I'd

1262
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:12,078
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some research</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on that that's</font>

1263
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:14,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

1264
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:21,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know like you know one mins felt</font>

1265
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:23,630
like inside yeah so there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1266
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:27,890
you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and look look around there's</font>

1267
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:30,200
a there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ton of projects on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dr</font>

1268
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:31,848
hub so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually projects where</font>

1269
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,038
they start to look at doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

1270
01:01:31,849 --> 01:01:37,729
host-based intrusion detection within

1271
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:43,339
these containers the eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> should just</font>

1272
01:01:37,729 --> 01:01:45,348
mention here the other thing the other

1273
01:01:43,339 --> 01:01:48,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">projects to check out within within</font>

1274
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:50,779
docker shipyard is complete deployment

1278
01:01:56,059 --> 01:02:00,650
they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot riding on it but</font>

1279
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,499
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ton I mean if you look at the</font>

1280
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:05,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">the this is a project that came out two</font>

1281
01:02:03,499 --> 01:02:08,959
years ago and if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> out on github</font>

1282
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:11,359
it's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I you know top 10 most</font>

1283
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:13,719
popular projects today it has something

1284
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:17,119
like the last time i check like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4,100</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1288
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:25,099
today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they either have no idea what</font>

1289
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:29,650
it is or they've definitely they're all

1290
01:02:25,099 --> 01:02:32,180
on board I don't I've been using it now

1291
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:33,920
myself for only a few months I would

1292
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:36,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardly consider myself a dock or expert</font>

1293
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,809
yet but in that time it's been so easy

1294
01:02:36,769 --> 01:02:41,868
and convenient to use to do to

1295
01:02:38,809 --> 01:02:43,279
development that it really gives the

1296
01:02:41,869 --> 01:02:44,749
maturity there that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

1297
01:02:43,279 --> 01:02:51,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">achieve in a short period of time really</font>

1298
01:02:44,749 --> 01:02:55,729
gives me<font color="#E5E5E5"> satisfaction yeah i have used</font>

1299
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:59,109
vagrant if you look at for example chef

1300
01:02:55,729 --> 01:03:02,598
would be another alternative to vagrant

1301
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:06,529
vagrant and chef any of the other

1302
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:09,349
provisioning environments are all work

1303
01:03:06,529 --> 01:03:12,019
seamlessly well with docker today a

1304
01:03:09,349 --> 01:03:15,170
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jenkins</font>

1305
01:03:12,019 --> 01:03:17,149
today and the other talks Jenkins has

1306
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:20,890
complete support for now quickly

1307
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:20,890
deploying docker containers as well

1308
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:27,769
that it's it's very easy you know so for

1309
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:29,739
example with with something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> chef or</font>

1310
01:03:27,769 --> 01:03:32,089
vagrant I want to be able to spin up

1311
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:33,739
small virtual operating systems and

1312
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:35,929
provision things within those virtual

1313
01:03:33,739 --> 01:03:37,519
operating systems those technologies are

1314
01:03:35,929 --> 01:03:39,529
completely amenable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor as well</font>

1315
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:42,698
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just not virtualizing an entire</font>

1316
01:03:39,529 --> 01:03:45,679
operating system it's closer to

1317
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:47,660
virtualizing in my example here right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1318
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:50,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">just wanted a python environment up with</font>

1319
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:51,499
that with Django that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1320
01:03:50,089 --> 01:04:00,729
those environments are very amenable to

1321
01:03:51,499 --> 01:04:08,089
this as well yeah so it's probably

1322
01:04:00,729 --> 01:04:13,729
running through a socket right yes so is

1323
01:04:08,089 --> 01:04:19,459
that socket on your laptop it's on my

1324
01:04:13,729 --> 01:04:23,598
laptop so<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear there yeah and to</font>

1325
01:04:19,459 --> 01:04:25,698
be clear like I that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

1326
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:33,589
separate container so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> only using</font>

1327
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:37,759
that just for just for the the hello

1328
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:39,769
world and bash example so i could blow

1329
01:04:37,759 --> 01:04:44,029
that container away what's it called

1330
01:04:39,769 --> 01:04:50,178
darker right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could blow this</font>

1331
01:04:44,029 --> 01:04:52,729
container away 09 that's right but so

1332
01:04:50,179 --> 01:04:54,289
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I especially as a new</font>

1333
01:04:52,729 --> 01:04:55,669
doctor user i would get confused by that

1334
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:57,650
as well it's like well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't blow that</font>

1335
01:04:55,669 --> 01:05:00,949
away that's my my baseline operating

1336
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:07,999
system so let's do docker compose so

1337
01:05:00,949 --> 01:05:10,249
I've blown away now you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto right if</font>

1338
01:05:07,999 --> 01:05:13,968
I do docker images I should only see the

1339
01:05:10,249 --> 01:05:17,019
three that oops dr. image is dr. test

1340
01:05:13,969 --> 01:05:20,239
web<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's when we built Python postgres</font>

1341
01:05:17,019 --> 01:05:22,549
now I'll go and do a darker compose up

1342
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:27,439
again I can easily launch those

1343
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:30,130
containers good question other questions

1344
01:05:27,439 --> 01:05:30,129
yeah

1345
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:45,520
yes and and I haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a</font>

1346
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:47,319
strong<font color="#CCCCCC"> roadmap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around that per se I mean</font>

1347
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,270
it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> so new and there's so many</font>

1348
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:55,270
people that are building technologies on

1349
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:58,509
top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that yeah I can't I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

1350
01:05:55,270 --> 01:06:01,150
hesitate to comment on a road map but

1351
01:05:58,510 --> 01:06:03,730
they make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy for you to be</font>

1352
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:06,190
able to understand what should my

1353
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:07,869
baseline image look like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can I</font>

1354
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:09,580
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy that to a development</font>

1355
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:11,350
environment and set up an entire

1356
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:14,290
framework around testing it and then be

1357
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:17,290
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push that to a deployment</font>

1358
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:18,940
environment as well so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example go CD</font>

1359
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:20,950
that I mentioned before really tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1360
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:22,300
focus on tackling that challenge right

1361
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:24,430
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a separate project than</font>

1362
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:27,460
docker if you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at any of the</font>

1363
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:28,960
presentations in this area it's clear I

1364
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:32,530
mean people realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this technology</font>

1365
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:35,680
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take off but there's a lot</font>

1366
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:37,830
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are trying to up to the</font>

1367
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:40,089
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of forks for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on docker</font>

1368
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:42,220
are clear indication of this there's a

1369
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:44,859
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are trying to attach</font>

1370
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:46,629
themselves so that wagon so what what

1371
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:47,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">really takes hold and becomes a standard</font>

1372
01:06:46,630 --> 01:07:11,500
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community I don't think</font>

1373
01:06:47,800 --> 01:07:15,820
anyone can comment on yet yeah so I

1374
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:18,220
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> early on that I work in the</font>

1375
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:22,660
area of embedded systems and the

1376
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:26,830
Internet of Things often what I you know

1377
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:28,509
as I look within those environments as I

1378
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:31,569
mentioned before you get to a point

1379
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:35,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">where you you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to create</font>

1380
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:39,869
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quickly ah that sort of</font>

1381
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:42,460
emulates a particular a particular

1382
01:07:39,869 --> 01:07:44,260
system that you've encountered so I'm

1383
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:45,670
largely from that standpoint

1384
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:48,910
looking at this from a defensive

1385
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:52,600
perspective right I may do a penetration

1386
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:54,009
test but it it's largely because I want

1387
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:57,040
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that something's configured</font>

1388
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:58,720
correctly or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't want to I just</font>

1389
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,160
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what this this</font>

1390
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,720
operating what this operating

1391
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,240
environment looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I might</font>

1392
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:06,640
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with it also say that I</font>

1393
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,529
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. a lot personally now in the</font>

1394
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:11,650
case like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave the example before of</font>

1395
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:13,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CDC right people will come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me and</font>

1396
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:16,420
I used to work for a long time as a

1397
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:18,779
penetration tester so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will come</font>

1398
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:22,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">to me and ask questions regarding a</font>

1399
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:24,220
particular vulnerability analysis I

1400
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:27,009
don't know much<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area but I'm</font>

1401
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:28,240
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tackle it so I but I need to</font>

1402
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:29,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to quickly provision that</font>

1403
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,719
environment and get it up and running

1404
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:47,920
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> away so there's where I've used it</font>

1405
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:50,500
more offensively other<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions using</font>

1406
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:54,460
some shared resources like we could get

1407
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:57,009
with the host OS<font color="#E5E5E5"> like would you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font>

1408
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:58,480
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor some of that locally even</font>

1409
01:08:57,009 --> 01:09:00,130
with that would it be some benefit like

1410
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:01,479
if you wanted to because I mean that's

1411
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:03,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the challenges of virtual</font>

1412
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:06,129
environment is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you spin off 10 or</font>

1413
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:07,390
15 machines simulate something or you

1414
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:08,920
know an application or something like

1415
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:13,420
that you have like what they were

1416
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:15,100
talking about you've got to like buy

1417
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:17,259
licenses for all those things that

1418
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:19,600
everything else to some degree like you

1419
01:09:17,259 --> 01:09:21,670
could possibly even just monitor all

1420
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,720
this because I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> penvenen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

1421
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:24,130
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's opening up a socket</font>

1422
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:26,830
locally or something like that for

1423
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:29,170
municate over I mean is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it theoretical</font>

1424
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:31,839
you just monitor on your host and watch

1425
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:33,609
those sockets or would it you could

1426
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:39,519
probably do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't explored that</font>

1427
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:42,150
area much yeah yeah yeah you should be

1428
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to yeah</font>

1429
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,900
yeah yeah I know that sometimes some

1430
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:51,370
applications will just straight a break

1431
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:55,509
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you try to do that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I'm</font>

1432
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:58,780
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> curious if ya thinking out loud</font>

1433
01:09:55,510 --> 01:10:01,930
yeah I've never I've never I've never

1434
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:04,330
explored that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> primarily right I</font>

1435
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:06,010
mentioned I'm a researcher so you know

1436
01:10:04,330 --> 01:10:09,790
you there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of other people that</font>

1437
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:11,650
do that the daily fight here what I what

1438
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:14,200
I would do in terms of intrusion

1439
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:16,480
detection technology is research new

1440
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:18,490
types of analytic techniques right I'm

1441
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,410
not concerned necessarily with all right

1442
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:23,530
well how am I going to deploy this so I

1443
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:25,389
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> explored that but I my suspicion</font>

1444
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:26,590
is that that's very possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> well I'd be</font>

1445
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:28,360
curious to you because I mean one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1446
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:29,920
biggest challenges of like AWS and stuff

1447
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,570
like that is how you can't you NSN and

1448
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,390
virtualize like they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1449
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:41,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtualize be doing NSM and like cloud</font>

1450
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:44,440
environments is it's the issues that

1451
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:46,360
overhead like that you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have yeah</font>

1452
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:48,759
people can you bring replicating the

1453
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:51,910
traffic into memory of sorts you know to

1454
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:53,440
do it yeah not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only I've been curious if</font>

1455
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:55,360
like that was that would be a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1456
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">you kind of have like containerized</font>

1457
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:00,670
systems that you can still monitor

1458
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,190
centrally without necessarily having to

1459
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:05,250
have as much that you could

1460
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:10,179
theoretically<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in a live environment</font>

1461
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:13,140
theoretically<font color="#CCCCCC"> then did you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1462
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:13,140
question before we break up

1463
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:25,280
yep it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really depends on your</font>

1464
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:27,849
environment so you could even push all

1465
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:31,070
the way back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> docker the docker hub</font>

1466
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:33,140
and share it that way you could just

1467
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:36,860
push your image<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your internal docker</font>

1468
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:38,690
registry so in the case of work that's

1469
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:41,210
usually what we do it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay I got</font>

1470
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:44,389
this all up and running<font color="#E5E5E5"> here pull it and</font>

1471
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:46,040
you'll get your your your image or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1472
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:48,110
could share the scripts<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically you</font>

1473
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,820
just share<font color="#CCCCCC"> the image because as I</font>

1474
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:51,679
mentioned before it's very easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1475
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:53,330
revisions on the image so when I do

1476
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:55,610
another pool it's just like get I'm just

1477
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:57,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">pulling the changes I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write I</font>

1478
01:11:55,610 --> 01:12:00,230
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it's not like I have to</font>

1479
01:11:57,010 --> 01:12:01,790
snapshot this<font color="#E5E5E5"> VM and share it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

1480
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:04,209
whole snapshot with another person I

1481
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:26,150
just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to quickly share I</font>

1482
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:29,090
the revision good question so you you

1483
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:31,250
can ah to your point it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1484
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:32,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">be scripted out and in fact I mentioned</font>

1485
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:35,090
earlier I will typically put that

1486
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:37,580
container into an interactive mode when

1487
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:40,190
i'm debugging so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the script if</font>

1488
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:41,690
i'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like trying to get an initial</font>

1489
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:43,099
environment up and running with

1490
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:44,509
everything that i need and something

1491
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,710
keeps breaking and I don't know why I'll

1492
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:47,150
say I'll just give it to me an

1493
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:50,360
interactive I'll debug it and figure out

1494
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:52,460
what's wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> but once i get my once i</font>

1495
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:55,370
want to start putting on my applications

1496
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:56,930
now i want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that ok well let</font>

1497
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:59,269
me figure this out let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to add</font>

1498
01:12:56,930 --> 01:13:02,690
things over time right the file system

1499
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:04,520
is is is permanent so if I as I make

1500
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:07,219
changes now I can get this to a point

1501
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:10,250
where all right now i can now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have my</font>

1502
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:11,660
updated container and now i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

1503
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:14,600
push and I'll share this with other

1504
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:16,940
people the scripting the scripting makes

1505
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:19,010
it easy from my perspective to get the

1506
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:20,570
to get a new environment up and running

1507
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:23,650
right away<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're pulling from</font>

1508
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:23,650
standardized images

1509
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:30,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can begin wearing a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the virtual</font>

1510
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:33,250
operating systems they have proprietary

1511
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:35,380
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe they're open source standards</font>

1512
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:36,910
for like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> like file systems work for</font>

1513
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:38,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">example are those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things off you skating</font>

1514
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:39,820
I take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that's kind of what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1515
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:40,809
differences likes of those shared

1516
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:42,910
resources are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be things like</font>

1517
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:44,020
bass like a file system or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1518
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:46,930
like that yeah those tend to be

1519
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:50,620
abstracted away and I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1520
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:52,330
remember is it ufs that docker uses it

1521
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:54,760
has its I mean that so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1522
01:13:52,330 --> 01:14:04,450
underlying file system but those those

1523
01:13:54,760 --> 01:14:05,800
yes yes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I so I really</font>

1524
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:09,090
appreciate it these were very engaging

1525
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,090
questions thanks
