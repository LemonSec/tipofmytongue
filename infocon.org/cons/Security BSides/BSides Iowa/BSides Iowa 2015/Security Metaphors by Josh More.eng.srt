00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything's ready for me to start so</font>

00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:57,070
for a metaphor discussion if not well

5
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:59,470
there's one other option so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,230
is besides that's my company if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> more ask me later so let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

8
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:08,350
introduce myself this is me as you can

9
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:11,800
see I've been at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for a while and</font>

10
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,440
this is what I do so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">normal security presentation this is a</font>

13
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,910
paper that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote a while back the</font>

14
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,830
presentation fundamentally is about

15
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,140
language how language informs our

16
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,750
thoughts and how our thoughts form our

17
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,220
language it's a mental loop that we go

18
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,490
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's how neurological</font>

structures function and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can go deeper</font>

20
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,880
into that after this talk if you're

21
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,280
interested but I'm limited to<font color="#CCCCCC"> only half</font>

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,530
an hour today so fundamentally the thing

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,710
to take away is languages reality

24
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:50,020
because the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind processes reality</font>

25
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:53,350
as language so to introduce metaphor we

26
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,479
tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> NIT and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an information security in</font>

particular to communicate with too

28
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,160
little attention towards our audience we

00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">often agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with individual words mean</font>

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,860
although if you look at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment</font>

31
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,699
section on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet you can see</font>

32
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:09,369
that's not always the case complex ideas

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:12,610
however take time to explain because

34
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:14,260
concepts build upon concepts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

35
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,360
faster you talk the faster you

36
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:21,010
communicate the more ambiguity there

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:24,730
tends to exist so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we focus on metaphor</font>

38
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,799
which is a concept in which one concept

39
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,140
represents something else so it gets

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,930
deeply meta the deeper into this you go

41
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,880
but it's a framework it's a framework we

42
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,050
use to understand the world to

43
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,140
communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with others and to</font>

44
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,819
understand how things<font color="#CCCCCC"> work so there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

45
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,309
some standard metaphors we use in

46
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:44,260
security you know one is security

47
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,829
requires safety and protection such as

48
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:51,370
the castle willingness to stop slow down

49
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:53,620
and assess or fast reliable

50
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,019
communication all of these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> metaphors</font>

51
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,980
work within the security space so what

52
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:02,620
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this mean one common example of</font>

53
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,200
metaphor is argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> of conflict this is</font>

54
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,110
you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of talking about metaphor</font>

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,089
niall thing one as thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and this</font>

56
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,519
comes out of a work by<font color="#CCCCCC"> lake off and</font>

57
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">johnson called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> metaphors we live by they</font>

00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,459
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> created the field of</font>

metaphorical analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid I think 30</font>

60
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:24,129
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so in argument of conflict you</font>

61
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,099
see language used people say things like

62
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:30,160
his claims are indefensible using the

63
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:32,709
defense model he attacked every week

64
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,390
point in my argument his criticisms were

65
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:36,849
right on target that right on target

66
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:40,599
language is used and I demolished his

67
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:42,459
argument so you have amorphous concepts

68
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:45,399
such as working<font color="#E5E5E5"> through disagreement</font>

69
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,680
compromise understanding others that are

70
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,480
made more easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand as physical</font>

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,680
constructs which are what we use in the

72
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:56,500
day-to-day world so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this used</font>

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,349
metaphor is used generally at a high

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,239
societal level but as you dig into

75
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:03,220
specific industries you see specific

76
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,230
metaphors as you dig deeper into

77
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,450
specific teams you might see teams

78
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,160
develop their own metaphors families

79
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,138
have their own metaphors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tighter</font>

80
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,750
the social group the better<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

81
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:16,750
metaphors resonate because the more

82
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:20,048
common their background is shared now

83
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,880
metaphor is also frame thought so this

84
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:24,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">is where small groups often get caught</font>

85
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if ideas for the language and</font>

86
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">language form ideas this loop is created</font>

87
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:32,199
and you can get caught in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> loop a</font>

88
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:35,039
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> example that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go</font>

through<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quick is in in</font>

90
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:39,130
Switzerland they make watches so they've

91
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,310
made watches for hundreds of years and

92
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,280
their mental concept of what a watch is

93
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,110
is a bunch of gears working together and

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,489
the better they can make the gears the

95
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,139
smaller they can make the gears more

96
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,330
reliable they can make the gears the

97
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:54,610
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watches fundamentally their</font>

98
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,010
concept of time is that of interlocking

99
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:00,220
gears and that metaphor ran the world

100
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,229
for years<font color="#CCCCCC"> until Japan came on the scene</font>

101
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,960
and decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a watch could actually</font>

102
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:07,150
be represented as a little LCD display

103
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,159
and all of a sudden

104
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,890
switzerland's hold over the market

105
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,860
collapsed because the world's metaphor

106
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:18,280
for what time was started to change and

107
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:20,950
we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in all industries whenever</font>

108
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,960
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a disruptive tendency that</font>

109
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,510
affects the world like we know when

110
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple released the ipod you know that</font>

00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't a new technology but what Apple</font>

112
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,289
was able to do was shift the metaphor

113
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,090
for what music was and because of that

114
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:38,230
they took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stranglehold</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,980
metaphors inhibit understanding with a

118
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,719
poorly selected metaphor you wind up

119
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,730
thinking in terms of the metaphor not in

120
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of reality because the brain is</font>

121
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:53,470
matching that linguistic processing

center and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily seeing</font>

the environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wind up</font>

125
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,669
getting stuck doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong things so</font>

126
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,110
our great example<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

127
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,930
apt stands for advanced persistent

128
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,470
threat and that's a metaphor that the US

129
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:14,980
military<font color="#E5E5E5"> created to identify attack</font>

130

targets with attack sources without

131
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:22,030
linking them to a specific a specific

132
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,670
country<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nation-state so it</font>

133
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,770
originated the US military and then it

134
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,500
hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public consciousness when that</font>

135
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:32,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">mandiant report came out and that's when</font>

136
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,410
the metaphor started to shift and we saw

137
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:38,830
it shifting from attackers as nations to

138
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:42,130
attackers as apt apt has advanced

139
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,539
malware apt as malware and all of a

140
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">sudden you have malware vendors saying</font>

141
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,010
we protect against apt and it turned

142
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,920
into a marketing buzz word because the

143
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:53,320
use of that construct shifted this was a

144
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,820
failure of metaphor because of ad hoc

145
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,170
metaphor mapping people didn't really

146
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">think through how they were using</font>

147
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:01,720
language and they lost control of it now

148
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,490
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also be used as a communication</font>

149

linguistic phila philosophy and

152
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:14,860
psychology and basically metaphor is not

necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> a replacement for factual</font>

handle complex

157

okay the more complex of a topic you're

158
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,480
talking about unless you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> more complex the more meta</font>

you've got to go the more metaphors<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

168
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,680
concepts and that's why if you try to

169
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,239
think back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that happened</font>

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,150
through you're not actually remembering

173
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,090
what actually happened so it's a

<font color="#CCCCCC">different expansion algorithms for the</font>

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,810
misunderstandings can really about the

00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,610
factual statements that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use when you</font>

are thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're talking</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the lossy compression algorithm and how</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">things are working fundamentally though</font>

186
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,370
it's an iterative process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

187
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,280
focused on speed but it's fundamentally

188
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,260
imperfect so you need to focus on the

189
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,299
gaps in communication and get better

190
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,780
understanding where those are to better

191
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:49,079
communicate with others because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

193
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,560
or breakdown when they're overly

00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,810
restrictive or when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> fail to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extend</font>

195
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,500
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction you want them to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go now</font>

196
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:00,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ascot grantman down in st. Louis did a</font>

study a while ago and collected a bunch

198
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,650
of security analogies and it's worth

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll go through a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of examples so</font>

202
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:16,110
this one is denial of distributed denial

203
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,170
of service as phone calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and this</font>

204
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,480
is used to explain what DDoS is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

205
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,790
non-technical people and the metaphor

206
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,470
that people use is you know imagine you

207
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,569
have a business and you've got a

208
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,520
secretary sitting there and she's

209
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,170
answering the phone whenever it rings

210
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,329
and you suddenly have a thousand people

211
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,469
calling in and whenever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone's</font>

212
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,360
picked up

213
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,410
no there's nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but you can't</font>

214
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell the difference between a good one</font>

215
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,110
and a bad once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to keep</font>

216
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,410
answering the phones so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

217
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:46,680
metaphor but it breaks down because in

218
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:49,189
modern days you've got caller ID so you

219
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,260
know how do you deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that situation</font>

220
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,960
modern days you can expand a call center

221
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:58,080
to India or wherever and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional</font>

222
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,900
call volume so the metaphor explains<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

223
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,670
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> only up to a point and then as</font>

224
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">people start to explore it they realize</font>

225
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,870
you know it kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of veers off in another</font>

226
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:11,490
direction and can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually serve to</font>

227
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:14,640
inhibit communication not improve it you

228
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:17,970
also see a breakdown and<font color="#E5E5E5"> adware as</font>

229
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,550
paparazi so with ad where you know you

230
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,350
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a application that's installed on a</font>

231
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,930
system and kind of follows you around

232
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,700
the internet logging the sites<font color="#E5E5E5"> you visit</font>

233
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,469
the purchases you make the ads you see

234
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,050
and it sends all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information to a</font>

235
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:34,770
third party so it works at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that level</font>

236
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it breaks down because the paparazi</font>

237
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:38,760
don't usually inject malware into

238
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,400
people's systems you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do</font>

239
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,220
that level of attack they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not usually</font>

240
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,780
engaged in theft so as you explore the

241
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,330
metaphor it starts to fail and you have

242
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,800
to recognize where that failure is so

243
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,910
you can bring in another metaphor or

244
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,380
shift to more technical communication

245
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,270
one that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> really liked that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd never</font>

246
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,510
run into until I started reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> Scott's</font>

247
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:03,210
work is storage as shelves and the idea

248
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,760
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you've got a row shelves each</font>

249
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,890
shelf has boxes on it each box is filled

250
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,600
with stacks of paper each stack of paper

251
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,990
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a file each box is like a</font>

252
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,210
cluster on a disk and large documents

253
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,770
are stored in multiple boxes but in a

254
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,390
relatively random order just kind of

255
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,689
based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what space is available in each</font>

256
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:25,050
box so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need an index and that maps</font>

257
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:27,210
to how file systems work but as you dig

258
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,250
deeper under the hood<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see that there</font>

259
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different formats in file systems</font>

260
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:35,070
you know EXT<font color="#CCCCCC"> two three and four and TFS</font>

261
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:38,040
you know XFS gfs riser if you're crazy

262
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">and all sorts of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do there</font>

263
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,120
so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all different types of</font>

264
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,670
indices<font color="#CCCCCC"> that handle the different filing</font>

265
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,370
systems differently you also have a

266
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,589
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> or opportunity in</font>

267
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,350
in a file systems called slack space

268
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:54,480
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can store things in boxes that</font>

269
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,510
aren't indexed or are indexed in a

270
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,140
different way and that breaks the

271
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:03,150
shelving metaphor so you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> breakdown</font>

272
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,310
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of complication you see</font>

273
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,750
breakdown of metaphor because of age you

274
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,000
know some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't store paper</font>

275
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,380
anymore you know if you talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,060
kind of thing to people that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in high</font>

277
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,160
school you know they've probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font>

278
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,920
stored a physical file you know their

279
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,329
entire lives everything's been digital

280
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,160
you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> breakdown at technical</font>

281
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:24,029
levels because things differ between

282
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:29,540
different file formats because metaphor

283
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:34,290
can be general or specific now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> T is</font>

284
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:36,540
rife with general metaphors you know we

285
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,640
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we we've all heard the</font>

286
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,800
internet is an information superhighway

287
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,150
you know you see this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

288
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,189
down and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> something fast you</font>

289
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,560
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> more lanes but as we learned a few</font>

290
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:49,200
years ago it's not exactly like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

291
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,550
highway oh it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like trucks taking</font>

292
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:56,779
stuff back and forth it's really a

293
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:59,219
series of tubes right so that sort of

294
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:01,730
discussion can be positive or negative

295
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:05,610
depending on what you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

296
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:08,940
now in 2008 there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> project to</font>

297
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:12,420
create artificial information security

298
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,279
metaphors and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first round of</font>

299
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">this process they found the normal ones</font>

300
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,570
that we see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the fortress</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Castle</font>

301
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,189
metaphor which we've all heard cops and

302
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:23,760
robbers we hear a little bit not quite

303
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:26,100
so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> Security's warfare was not as</font>

304
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,709
common in 2008 but it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the</font>

305
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">place now and then they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> went through a</font>

306
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:34,020
concept mining exercise and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

307
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:37,589
metaphors around biology the medical

308
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:39,029
field economics things like that so one

309
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:41,430
example was they tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create this</font>

310
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:43,290
architectural metaphor where you build

311
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,420
security into something you know we've

312
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,939
seen that in various papers and

313
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:51,060
presentations and things but that's

314
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,220
generally a metaphorical failure because

315
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,989
very few of us are architects you know

316
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">very few of us are actually building</font>

317
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">something new we're more having to add</font>

318
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:00,930
something to a

319
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,870
network that already exists or system

320
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,640
that already exists you know we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

321
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,030
deal with already<font color="#E5E5E5"> built environments and</font>

322
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,550
the building in model just doesn't work

323
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:14,610
in the healthcare space we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

324
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:17,040
attempts to use security metaphors in

325
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:19,530
measuring health you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

326
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">health check of the network you need to</font>

327
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:23,939
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> preventative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maintenance which is you</font>

328
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,750

329
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:30,270
but you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure because we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

330
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,710
really good at using medical metaphors

331
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,060
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> medical field to begin with you</font>

332
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,280
know we are fundamentally<font color="#CCCCCC"> not good at</font>

333
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,989
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> care of ourselves so if you take</font>

334
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,579
a failing metaphor for one industry and

335
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:41,480
apply it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to another you just have a</font>

336
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,410
failing metaphor over there to the

337
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,750
better you understand the metaphor

338
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,360
though you can anticipate the breakdown

339
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,450
and that results in favorite metaphors

340
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,430
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ran a contest a few years ago on a</font>

341
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">private security mailing list people to</font>

342
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,650
share with me the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metaphors that they</font>

343
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">found that worked best so as expected</font>

344
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,939
the castle metaphor is one of the first

345
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones popped up okay so Michael gave me</font>

346
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,530
this one and in this you see a metaphor

347
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,420
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is like a castle</font>

348
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:12,240
you've got a wall you've got walls amote

349
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,219
archers guards a drawbridge and a secret

350
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,020
door so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can bypass the hassle if</font>

351
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,640
you need to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got to see</font>

352
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">the secret door quite a lot in The Lord</font>

353
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,640
of the Rings movie with Legolas coming

354
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:25,680
down and you know doing crazy elf stuff

355
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,830
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the core of the metaphor you</font>

356
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,819
know you have a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

357
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">untrustworthy townspeople they know</font>

358
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,340
where the door is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font>

359
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,350
compromised they could tell the

360
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,060
attackers what's going on if the

361
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,940
attackers focus on the people not the

362
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,400
infrastructure then the back door will

363
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">be used and it will be used for attacks</font>

364
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,840
so the metaphor is useful but it

365
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,120
completely falls apart as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

366
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:52,110
person you're talking to says oh but I

367
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:55,470
trust my people right and you have to

368
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,450
understand where that fail point is so

369
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,280
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes up you can shift you'll</font>

370
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,320
pivot and start talking in a different

371
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,439
way and you know in this case have a

372
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,990
discussion based on trust this is

373
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">another example going to a doctor you</font>

374
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,140
know somebody goes to a doctor for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

375
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,390
first time in many years might be a lot

376
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">of findings from the blood tests</font>

377
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:17,670
blood pressure tests whatever's going on

378
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,680
which ones are actionable so here's the

379
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:22,110
core of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the metaphor I mean the younger</font>

380
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,790
you are the more time you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font>

381
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,100
with some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things now if</font>

382
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,260
somebody goes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor there 25</font>

383
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,490
haven't gone for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years it's very</font>

384
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">different than if somebody goes to the</font>

385
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,470
doctor there 85 and haven't gone for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

386
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:37,680
years some things are more fixable than

387
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,030
others and this matches the security

388
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,810
fits at the beginning of the product of

389
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:44,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the project kind of metaphor right but</font>

390
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,959
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fail if people dislike</font>

391
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,210
doctors you know if they're big

392
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,800
homeopathy believers something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

393
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:52,650
so you have to know what how the

394
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,479
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinks so you can choose these</font>

395
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:58,050
mental algorithms that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

396
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">exist in their brains too this was one</font>

397
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:05,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorites security as a submarine</font>

398
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:07,050
so a man submarine it's useless without

399
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,389
the people it has to protect the people

400
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,770
and get them moving you have to be a

401
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,150
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit careful out the doors you</font>

402
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,520
know doors on a submarine kind of

403
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,680
important because they serve two

404
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,720
functions keep the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in and keep</font>

405
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,820
the water out so you have to have a

406
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,319
breech plan what happens if water gets

407
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,510
in how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you clean up how do you make</font>

408
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure the security is still good in that</font>

409
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,950
situation you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's a lot of</font>

410
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,870
insight in this one basic metaphor it's

411
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:33,030
very useful it's highly extensible

412
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,820
highly flexible fast and easy to

413
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:39,080
understand and it's completely derailed

414
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:44,159
when somebody says what's a submarine

415
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,659
right this works in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s.</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because we</font>

416
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,250
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through World War</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 we know what</font>

417
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,260
submarines are it's in our movies it's

418
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,060
in our books but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you take this to</font>

419
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,100
somebody lives in the desert in<font color="#E5E5E5"> nambia</font>

420
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:56,909
they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have any idea what</font>

421
00:17:53,100 --> 00:18:00,570
you're talking about then you've got the

422
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:02,430
sports metaphors so this one you know

423
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,669
metaphor firewall is the defensive line

424
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:08,360
other technologies as linebackers good

425
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:10,740
code is cornerbacks laughs as safeties

426
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,689
sokka's coaches lead as defensive

427
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,390
coordinator like the submarine it's

428
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,240
highly highly flexible but it's a total

429
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:20,430
failure if you don't know football I

430
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:23,430
don't know football I got this metaphor

431
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:25,290
and when I was reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> it until I got</font>

432
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,020
this from Jonathan I had no idea what

433
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">cornerbacks</font>

434
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:32,770
these did it worked in Reverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me</font>

435
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:35,110
this is what I understood the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metaphor</font>

436
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:37,480
it helped me<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand football I mean</font>

437
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:39,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be successful metaphors have to be</font>

438
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,560
selected to facilitate communication and

439
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">the introduction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of metaphor should</font>

440
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:48,040
decrease complexity which gets into

441
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,730
audience so most businesses have lots of

442
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,500
stakeholders and this draws from a paper

443
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,660
that forced or wrote called planning for

444
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,340
failure now the paper itself doesn't

445
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,930
have that much that's new in it but it

446
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,850
does lay out the stakeholders in a

447
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:05,860
useful way so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the</font>

448
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:08,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">stakeholders in a business you can use</font>

449
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:11,260
concepts that are adapted to match the

450
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,490
metaphors they're likely to use and this

451
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,260
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be better except to the</font>

452
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,660
technical facts<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to keep</font>

453
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,800
backtracking to explain the technical

454
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,460
issues that are behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font>

455
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,409
talking about so in like if you're

456
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,610
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all employees you're not</font>

457
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,710
going to have a lot of shared background

458
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,979
to work with so you have to use general

459
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,320
more cultural metaphors a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

460
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US you can assume</font>

461
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,159
most people have gone to school at least

462
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a certain extent so security is</font>

463
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,330

<font color="#E5E5E5">people have families so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Security's</font>

enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have vehicles or homes you can</font>

467
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,450
use securities maintenance you can also

00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:53,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">use security as resource management</font>

469
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:56,560
dealing with finances now nit it's a

470
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,180
narrower group more shared background so

471
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can you can use metaphors that</font>

472
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,450
resonate a little bit better if you're

473
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,409
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> windows people and you're a</font>

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> itself is different</font>

477
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,860
you can remap security concepts to

00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,330
general tech issues you can say a denial

479
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,510
of service attack is like a runaway

a user left themselves logged in and

somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> walked by and did something on</font>

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,150
their computer you know they'll

understand that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with law enforcement you know</font>

486
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,680
there's a breach you've got law

487
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,330
enforcement people coming in law

488
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,860
enforcement is an isolated<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture</font>

489
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,590
anybody here in law enforcement right

490
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,449
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you work</font>

491
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:45,230
if you work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with law enforcement people</font>

492
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:47,990
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that their tent I've seen</font>

493
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,240
two types people that really are driven

494
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,669
to protect others and people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

495
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,320
really driven to control others and it

496
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,059
really helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know which type you're</font>

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,330
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking so you</font>

can select<font color="#CCCCCC"> a metaphor appropriately we</font>

502
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,990
since the camera is not pointing at you

503
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:21,110
who has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> negative opinion of the FBI</font>

504
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:22,899
anybody okay most audiences there's more

505
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:27,500
people raising their hand for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

506
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:31,070
the FBI has this the FBI has a serious

507
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:34,520
metaphor problem because whenever

508
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:38,510
they're in the news or on TV they're

509
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:41,690
either portrayed as evil or clueless you

510
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:44,809
know you get the the x-files view of the

511
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,130
FBI and you get the media saying oh hey

512
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:47,750
they're spying they're doing this doing

513
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,140
that they shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing that when</font>

514
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:53,840
all the good stuff doesn't show so

515
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,669
unless you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understand what's</font>

516
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,490
going on there's this communication gap

517
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:00,230
between the FBI and the media between

518
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the media and everybody else so there's</font>

519
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,779
two areas where communication can fail

520
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,908
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it almost always does so if you're</font>

521
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">dealing with law enforcement unless you</font>

522
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,970
know otherwise you have to assume

523
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:13,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're non-technical you have to frame</font>

524
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:16,370
the discussion around why it matters

525
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:18,408
focus on security is protection damage

526
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:20,149
and capture they'll understand that

527
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:21,890
you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> past those initial</font>

528
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:25,039
communication hurdles and be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

529
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,720
dive into what matters pretty quick and

530
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,970
finally there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are external service</font>

531
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,980
providers so you're these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors</font>

532
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,750
companies you're working with and these

533
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,179
people are highly concerned with blame

534
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,460
because if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can lay a problem at</font>

535
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:40,159
their door you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave they could</font>

536
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,679
lose a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money so they almost</font>

537
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,450
always fall into blame deflection mode

538
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:47,960
and you have to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and work</font>

539
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,039
through it so the business model you

540
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,440
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand the business model is</font>

541
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,200
almost always higher quality or lower

542
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost</font>

543
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,630
and both models if the blame falls on

544
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,820
the business they're going to the blame

545
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:02,429
risks the business that they're facing

546
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:07,428
so they have very strong incentives not

547
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:11,250
to be blamed now metaphor conflict can

548
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:12,990
will happen and they will try at their

549
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,169
hardest to prevent the blame for falling

550
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:19,110
on them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Security's blame is only</font>

551
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:21,690
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work if and only if you can lay</font>

552
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,490
the blame somewhere else so it tends to

553
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">work better is focusing on securities</font>

554
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,600
discovery telling them hey I need your

555
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:29,460
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure this out you know we're a</font>

556
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,070
team on this we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure it</font>

557
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,019
doesn't happen again so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get deep</font>

558
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,658
enough into their system their

559
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:38,760
technology their people and understand

560
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:40,049
what actually happened then if it's

561
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their blamed because you've</font>

562
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:43,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">been working with them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together for a</font>

563
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:47,250
while they're more likely to work with

564
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:49,649
you on resolving the problem so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

565
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,600
you do this there are a lifestyle

566
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:54,178
metaphors that social engineers have

567
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,649
really been focused on for a while they

568
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:59,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really call it metaphor research</font>

569
00:23:55,649 --> 00:24:02,729
but that's what they're doing so you

570
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,580
stereotype people you can look at people

571
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:07,799
by age generations tend to communicate

572
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,779
better internally you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at by</font>

573
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:12,149
race you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you get language choices</font>

574
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:15,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">there issues of prejudice that come up a</font>

575
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:17,699
class has economic options societal

576
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:19,289
expectations hobbies you know baseball

577
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,539
cooking photography if you know what

578
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:23,158
somebody's doing you can understand a

579
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,158
little bit about how they think and you

580
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,840
can select metaphors appropriately in

581
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:30,570
summary people understand best what they

582
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,639
already know so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

583
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,678
to regularly communicate with somebody

584

who<font color="#E5E5E5"> who does fishing you know you should</font>

585
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably learn a little bit about how</font>

586
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:40,080
fish work you know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people find the</font>

587
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:42,539
fish how you know what kind of gear they

588
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,830
need things like that if somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> does a</font>

589
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,539
lot of cooking on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side you should</font>

590
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,789
know about food prep you know security

591
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:49,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">as prepping the ingredients ahead of</font>

592
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:51,840
time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're ready if you need them</font>

593
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,000
later you know those metaphors will work

594
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're a baseball fan learn a little a</font>

597
00:24:57,389 --> 00:25:03,560
because it's completely incomprehensible

598
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:05,810
but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will not attempt to</font>

599
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand you until you attempt to</font>

600
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:12,610
understand that which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where personas</font>

601
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:16,190
come in now in agile development

602
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:17,629
personas are used intrinsically as part

603
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,510
of the development process in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

604
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:24,380
cases and this is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifying</font>

605
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:26,720
a person to help define applications and

systems how to design systems how

607
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,790
they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be work worked with and</font>

608
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:34,610
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> assign names and a generalities</font>

609
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,680
help but specifics help more now word of

610
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:39,290
note you have to be careful when<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

611
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:42,110
stereotypes this way because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very</font>

612
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:44,600
lossy compression they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

613
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:48,409
metaphors that allow for fast framing

614
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:51,500
and they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to trap real people</font>

615
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:53,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">in boxes that don't match them the</font>

616
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,610
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through this exercise is to</font>

617
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,010
speed up communication and make it more

618
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,629
accurate so if you are trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fit</font>

619
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody to stereotype that doesn't fit</font>

620
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:06,290
the stereotype has to change because the

621
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:07,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">person will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not now the three we're</font>

the US you may need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adapt this</font>

625
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,970
accordingly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> three examples here and</font>

George security is learning will

and security is helping others you know

her than for other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the final</font>

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:17,570

him because he's good at solving

707
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,990
problems so how do you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to somebody</font>

00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,070
like this

security is learning works because he's

00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:41,289
technology analogies so Linux securities

715
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,799
microsoft security will work document

716
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:46,929
security as data security will work

717
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:49,600
security as care works if somebody has

719
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,280
as protection and then security as

720

improvement works because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

this kind of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I don't see any</font>

727
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:21,690
cell phones going up so there's my

00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:21,689
contact information any questions yes

729
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,799
they're called tag clouds and there are

730
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,539
various systems online that you

731
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically upload the image that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

732
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:37,870
blank and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> a word list and it maps</font>

733
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,580
it in most of them have<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone pay since i</font>

734
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,889
made this presentation and i don't know

735
00:30:39,580 --> 00:31:01,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">of any free open-source ones so there's</font>

736
00:30:41,890 --> 00:31:03,700
a project for you anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else yes so</font>

737
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can read that there's a book called</font>

738
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:10,150
images of organization by gareth morgan

739
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:12,549
which it is a massive tome but it's it's

740
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:14,919
an important read and it talks about how

741
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:17,710
metaphors are used in businesses and

742
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:19,780
once you start thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it you</font>

743
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,740
start recognizing them and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a</font>

744
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,389
matter of training your brain to

745
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,610
recognize them than to come up with them

746
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,860
because once you recognize them you're

747
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,750
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of building that list in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your mind</font>

748
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,399
of different things and then when you

749
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:34,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the list you can try them out on</font>

750
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,830
different people social engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

751
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:38,139
art of human hacking by Chris had McGee

752
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,590
goes into some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff as well not</font>

753
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,630
not

754
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,720
directly because social engineering book

755
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:52,720
but those are two good resources to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

756
00:31:43,720 --> 00:32:04,779
you started depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> who you're</font>

757
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:07,390
talking to well I know what you're

758
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:09,669
trying to say i'm going to guess that in

759
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,679
some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're talking</font>

760
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:13,149
technically like most people at this

761
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,799
conference you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tech</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

762
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:16,928
don't need to delve<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much into</font>

763
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,929
metaphors because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all have a shared</font>

764
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:21,309
technical background where metaphors

765
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:23,260
really come into<font color="#CCCCCC"> handies when you're</font>

766
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:25,928
talking to people outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your field</font>

767
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,908
and in that case you're more trying to

768
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:30,039
understand what's going on and you're

769
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:32,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">not as likely to get caught up in the</font>

770
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:34,960
this metaphor is tiring metaphors get

771
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,419
old and tired when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're mapping to</font>

772
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,809
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you already have mapped and</font>

773
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:42,909
you don't need to convey new data right

774
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:45,428
metaphors are useful for new data and

775
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:48,700
varying people into in conversation in a

776
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:50,890
new way they're old and boring if you

777
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,570
already know the information so I mean

778
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,830
that that's more paying attention to you

779
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:58,779
don't tell people<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff they already</font>

780
00:32:53,830 --> 00:33:01,710
know than anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> so any any other</font>

781
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:01,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions yes</font>

782
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:27,460
well so extending the metaphor is a

783
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,140
problem but targeting a metaphor is a

784
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,480
problem as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well because if you target</font>

785
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,100
target it too narrowly and the person

786
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> background you know</font>

787
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,649
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to have the expansion</font>

788
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,850
algorithm in their brain and it's just

789
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:42,160
not going to work at all so try to make

790
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,050
them broad enough to cover whatever

791
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,940
space you know is in their brain but the

792
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:49,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">more you can learn about them the more</font>

793
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:51,220
tightly you could target so it's less

794
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,770
about always<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and more about</font>

795
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,810
really know your audience do your

796
00:33:53,770 --> 00:34:02,040
reconnaissance to figure things out

797
00:33:55,810 --> 00:34:06,389
before you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them anything else</font>

798
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,389
all right sit
