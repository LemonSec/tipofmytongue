00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,760
all right I'm Andrew Freeborn I want to

2
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Rebecca me today if they're</font>

3
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,230
organizers and sponsors and for you guys

00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:51,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being here as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so today I'm</font>

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,980
major Freeborn over for a large<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank in</font>

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,050
omaha nebraska and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

7
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,959
about intro to web app testing with

8
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,459
mattila<font color="#CCCCCC"> day so I picked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk</font>

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,320
because I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be pretty</font>

10
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,989
interesting to show a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasps</font>

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,180
projects and kind of right here from

12
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,740
peers place back in Omaha as far as how

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,440
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get into what map testing how do i</font>

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,740
test<font color="#CCCCCC"> websites is it some kind of Magic's</font>

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,750
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do similarly magics but you</font>

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,550
know not knowing how to get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,710
kind of kind of hard to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it so</font>

18
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,850
today we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover what is this</font>

19
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,009
mattila day tools for the job some

20
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,890
techniques that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned from it and</font>

21
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:36,960
not refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to for learning and growing</font>

22
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:43,170
learning with mattila day demo and some

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,878
links in QA so Matilda is an o las

24
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,759
project a las week you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not familiar</font>

25
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,950
with them they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open source based</font>

26
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,590
organization they promote standards

27
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,390
applications projects and they really

28
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,039
help to prote knowledge within the

29
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,649
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and help us all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> browser</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

30
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,929
community and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> these projects is</font>

31
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">mattila day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I truly maintained by</font>

32
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:06,810
a German ruin his twitter handle is

33
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:09,509
weaponized and it's very active<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font>

34
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,949
always adding new features that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see</font>

35
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,319
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the field as far as a new</font>

36
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:15,179
vulnerabilities and so it's constantly

37
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,069
maintained with new techniques and

38
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,569
vulnerabilities as an intentionally a

39
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:23,399
horrible website so when the problems of

40
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:25,109
learning and trying to test and kind of

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,599
get access to these kind of applications

42
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,970
as know how do I you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do i</font>

43
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,129
how do i test what do i need to go so

44
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,920
Matilda is a burnable as a intentionally

45
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:36,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerable application website that you</font>

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,399
run that has all kinds of

47
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,530
vulnerabilities and so with that it's

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,900
very pentest friendly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know that I</font>

49
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,269
can drill down to certain probabilities

50
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,230
and focus on those were nobility is not

51
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:51,200
be to focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> and learn and grow say with</font>

52
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,660
a sequel injection or

53
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brooklyn authentication and so being a</font>

54
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:00,379
no-loss project there's emphasis on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

55
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">OS top 10 2013 even back to 2010 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

56
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:04,429
2007 but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh wah so it's</font>

57
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,870
you know websites aren't just know

58
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,150
what's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little ass but they have</font>

59
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,040
focuses on web services<font color="#CCCCCC"> in JSON</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks</font>

60
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,000
and XML and these are things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see</font>

61
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,160
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time for different applications</font>

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,980
to measure of vertical or where you're

63
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:22,879
at and with that it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit</font>

64
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:24,920
up and highly accessible so the tools

65
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,750
for the job it doesn't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> much to run</font>

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,910
this application<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's if you have a</font>

67
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,400
relatively newish computer you're able

68
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,440
to you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to install VMware</font>

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,870
Player or virtual box or hyper-v or even

70
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,750
run your host OS it's an Apache web site

71
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,370
so it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to drop in and go if</font>

72
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,470
you want to install<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know 30 gigs</font>

73
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,880
is more than enough space or I'm running

74
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,420
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now on 12 gigs of space and</font>

75
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,069
four gigs of<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM on your laptop or your</font>

76
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,849
boxer you may have for the whole less

77
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:55,130
but giving a gig<font color="#CCCCCC"> is well enough for the</font>

78
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:57,230
publication<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course mattila day I</font>

79
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,359
since it's a lost open source it's

80
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,010
currently on<font color="#CCCCCC"> sourceforge and github so</font>

81
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:02,600
we free to pull down<font color="#E5E5E5"> look it apart you</font>

82
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,090
know take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it apart add things for your</font>

83
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,380
organization or even email back Jeremy

84
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,209
and say hey I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen this vulnerability</font>

85
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,040
who talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe adding this in or</font>

86
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,019
I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this bug and I found bugs and</font>

87
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,850
talking with Jeremy and getting things

88
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,030
fixed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you push back out to the</font>

89
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:19,700
community so everybody's benefiting from

90
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:21,649
those kind experiences and so one

91
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,530
popular ways that I found using motility

92
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:27,679
is using with the same rate samurai WTF

93
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:30,080
linux distro it's a live CD or you can

94
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,630
install it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the WTF is for web</font>

95
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,810
testing framework and so samurai has not

96
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,700
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matilda but DB WA and other tools</font>

97
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,680
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like a cali a bit more for</font>

98
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,469
web testing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> counties more offensive</font>

99
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,910
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> summarize more for like having in a</font>

100
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,950
closed system with tools and

101
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,360
applications you can test and have an

102
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,060
enclosed space you don't worry about

103
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,289
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tag or to</font>

104
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:57,680
internal to your organization and with a

105
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:59,930
samurai there's the OS zap project

106
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,550
similar burp suite but<font color="#E5E5E5"> coursers burp</font>

107
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,920
suite free on there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other open</font>

108
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,050
source tools that they have on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

109
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,560
free tools as well so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

110
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:11,820
it on samurai you can also put on your

111
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,530
distribution or your Bureau OSS needed

112
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,050
some techniques for web testing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

113
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,530
twisper fun to point<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a tools and</font>

114
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,960
good you found tickle injection well you

115
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,130
know as a time place for automated tools

116
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,099
but it's also a time and place for

117
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,770
manual testing as well so if you know

118
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,600
both tools are very helpful automated

119
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,969
tools will give you a stupid land help

120
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,580
you to identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok based on these i made</font>

121
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,750
scans I've seen that there's a sequel

122
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,210
injection from abilities there's

123
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,520
Brooklyn authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we just</font>

124
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,500
leave it at automated testing what do we

125
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,900
really learn from that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call my boss</font>

126
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,640
and say hey boss I felt an 84 seal

127
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,320
injection entry points she's going to

128
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,500
say great we're gonna be so awesome

129
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,440
those developers well it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

130
00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:00,870
you tested her right you validated that

131
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,870
they're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> single Junction points</font>

132
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:07,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">no so how can come how can actually test</font>

133
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,040
that why how would I know do I use

134
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,640
simple map do i do use manual testing do

135
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,050
i use all these other tools so there's a

136
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,729
time place for automated testing there's

137
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,140
also time place for a manual testing and

138
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,420
validation of these actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> burn</font>

139
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,669
abilities that we find but how do i test

140
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,560
that how<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just go to google comments</font>

141
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,720
are doing super map or these other

142
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,600
injection in tents well mattila tea

143
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,550
helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer that question and so also</font>

144
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,530
with these processes we need to make

you would test that this is how you also

test this popular ways to do cross-site

these techniques that's not really a

182
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,700
that but definitely adding these things

183
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,619
from all these different kinds of

184
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,330
standards to help make a more holistic

185
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,790
approach to your testing procedures so

you're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> more coverage insurance or</font>

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">we actually learn with utility you know</font>

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,310
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned earlier and so there are</font>

no Billy's broken out so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

say i came to rough hand I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

201
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,920
Jimmy just put out a new vulnerability I

00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,260
cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember that ability but I want</font>

206
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,820
kind of hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this more ability is</font>

207
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,819
there and exploitable so with that I

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,230
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to refine my craft against XSS or</font>

the website is very good at helping you

217
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,540
has different hints and walk through

218
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,849
self you already know quite what you're

219
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,560
doing you can you know try testing you

220
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,570
know it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable to sss or a</font>

221
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,819
sequel injection or multitude of

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,520
different vulnerabilities but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

223
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,920
very top as we'll see in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the demo</font>

224
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,199
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hints you can do walkthroughs</font>

225
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,630
videos and so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really helps break down</font>

226
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,580
for like the person who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not familiar</font>

227
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,410
with all these kind of things what it

228
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,330
was it take need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> google do i need to</font>

229
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,370
go this don't even buy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

230
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's things that helpful as</font>

231
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,260
far as books and<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos and walkthroughs</font>

232
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,800
but this helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be an all one solution</font>

233
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,930
not all institutions but helps to help

234
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,459
the user as much as possible understand

235
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,319
these vulnerabilities and how to exploit

236
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,750
them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> its with them safely in the</font>

237
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:29,760
environment where they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test</font>

238
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:34,470
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that alright</font>

239
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,470
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some demos</font>

240
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:54,110
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have my machines this being</font>

241
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:59,600
or fusion prob with em but I i just have

242
00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:03,709
the stock simmer I<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2.1 in distribution</font>

243
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,990
installed on my machine and so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a by</font>

244
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:07,969
default an older version agility is

245
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,000
installed on there but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

246
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:14,360
version right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to can't be before</font>

247
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,970
six not 19 and so it's a cotillion vulva

248
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,079
ng environment you definitely to benefit

249
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,490
most from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this let's get the latest</font>

250
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">version and basically just drop into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

WRP or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bangle where you're hosting</font>

252
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,949
your ass hat but there's all kinds of

253
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:34,399
documentation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> youtube videos online</font>

254
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:37,189
showing how you're able to update

255
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,190
mattila day things won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through so</font>

256
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:47,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mentioned let's go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through some i'm</font>

257
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:47,350
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm in chrome so let's</font>

258
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:59,890
alright so<font color="#E5E5E5"> on look inside you can see</font>

259
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:05,229
here we have a top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 for the lost 2013</font>

260
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:09,140

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:11,210
html5 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML and other kind of based of</font>

262
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,400
our abilities not really specifically

263
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,750
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all top 10 but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if my things we see</font>

00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,050
the wild that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to learn and grow</font>

265
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,540
from documentation and he's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

266
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:23,420
ginger kind of things real quickly I

267
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:29,480
want to see if you put in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here what he</font>

268
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:31,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">added yep so the recent probability that</font>

269
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,010
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was released and kind of I</font>

270
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say widely know but still out</font>

271
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,510
there is the path relative<font color="#CCCCCC"> stylesheet</font>

272
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,070
injection and so these kind of things

273
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:45,439
that if we don't know about we can't

274
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:47,210
test so having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very well supported</font>

275
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,130
community and having this kind of

276
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,620
applications we can test this and no

277
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:54,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this is how I test this I think</font>

278
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:58,220
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my developers and say hey guys</font>

279
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:00,380
I'm Dallas you guys guys really need to

280
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:05,660
stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> being an appliance because you guys</font>

281
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:06,890
ready to fix it so well browse through

282
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,449
here we see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the different kind</font>

283
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:12,710
of attacks we've had on the test with

284
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:15,110
and we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on down to a size 15</font>

285
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:18,610
we'll go to reflect<font color="#E5E5E5"> it first order and</font>

286
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,610
we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a DNS lookup</font>

287
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,099
Oh

288
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:59,020
set piece that would be a day of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

289
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">this morning</font>

290
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:13,380
you need

291
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:19,189
what's that I might be crunching he an

292
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:19,189
esper now it shouldn't shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

293
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,019
let me try to just sit back

294
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:56,249
this is we're really slow<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right all</font>

295
00:14:52,930 --> 00:15:02,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so here we go cross-site scripting</font>

296
00:14:56,249 --> 00:15:04,470
go don't quite know what to do so up

297
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,879
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of see if your says</font>

298
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,430
home loginregister as you would for

299
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:15,610
let's say a bank or any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> medicaid</font>

00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:23,979
reset the<font color="#E5E5E5"> database and show a lot so</font>

304
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:29,019
simple to pop and various ways your you

305
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:31,749
don't want to have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level</font>

306
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:33,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">five you know strong government security</font>

307
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:35,259
clearance protect its website for trying

to learn definitely want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have the</font>

309
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:38,709
easy approach to learn different

310
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,170
vulnerabilities and not be discouraged

311
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:42,849
or like say all is it too hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't</font>

312
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure this out you definitely want to</font>

313
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,029
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to do these kind of</font>

314
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:48,699
things and build<font color="#CCCCCC"> upon what you learned</font>

315
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:51,670
incrementally<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the more complex and</font>

316
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:53,979
more intensive attacks and so with that

317
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:57,309
we'll go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few attacks here and</font>

318
00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:02,250
we'll go ahead and show<font color="#E5E5E5"> their hands</font>

319
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:02,250
toggle hints elegance

320
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,510
we'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it pops up</font>

321
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:19,589
so our way for that let's do some

322
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:19,589
lookups co-host look up dns

323
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:28,200
so with that it shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be too hard to</font>

324
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,610
do different attacks you know

325
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately I can't really show it's</font>

326
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">because i would like to the different</font>

327
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,340
born abilities but as soon as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hit</font>

328
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:43,750
the the show walkthroughs you'll see all

329
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:46,330
the kinds of this is all the hints that

330
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:48,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">i mentioned earlier with the things you</font>

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> perform with that i'ma do those kind</font>

332
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:54,130
of things and why you would want to do

333
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:57,730
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in certain situations for</font>

334
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:59,050
example for housewife scripting there's

335
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,880
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of built-in mitigations for</font>

336
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,979
different web browsers so if you're

337

testing the website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your proxy with</font>

blocking it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this will be learned</font>

bull pen testing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox is still</font>

341
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:17,020
vulnerable but firefox says Oh whistle

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,550
should i<font color="#CCCCCC"> alert pop-up box and so you</font>

need to keep in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well that it's</font>

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">not enough to just test a chrome and</font>

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:25,690
call it good enough I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> ie a really</font>

346

sad tool is still a vowel tool to help

349
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:36,639
firefox but even other browsers like a

mantra through<font color="#CCCCCC"> olas help to show that</font>

351
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,690
you know if the website isn't touching

00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,120
that your client side tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in</font>

00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">pitching and protecting you it's still</font>

354
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,600
horrible if the user is on some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

355
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:51,270
a browser or intentionally trying to

356
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,270
exploit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the application so it's still</font>

357
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:59,020
it's still avail to show and do testing

358
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,780
through different kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of website web</font>

359
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,270
browsers and show how the attention

360
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,860
exploited so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm new to the business</font>

361
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,000
on let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have heard a lot about</font>

362
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:11,740
this xss thing sounds pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sweet so</font>

363
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,050
i'll let go to the web pages we right

364
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">now and will click on contacts with</font>

365
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,950
being hands so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot more</font>

366
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,740
permission than when I started my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

367
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,250
time here instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a text box a button</font>

368
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,190
I had no ideal to do you have to do aid

369
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,840
in Google

370
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,940
right but I didn't know what I would

371
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,470
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing next and so as part of</font>

372
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,580
the problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for learning how to do</font>

373
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,190
about testing because you don't know

374
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,139
where you need to go with this and so as

375
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,360
in here we have all the supplementation

376
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,760
the built-ins website<font color="#CCCCCC"> subs not pulling</font>

377
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,679
off through google my adapter is down so

378
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm gonna wait wait for or Google the</font>

379
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,660
full web page or Wikipedia article at

380
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,550
all information here<font color="#E5E5E5"> built in so the</font>

381
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,220
user a self-paced<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can learn from</font>

382
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:55,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">these kind of things I learned oh ok so</font>

383
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:58,040
that's how I do the the attack I pull

384
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:01,100
some jobs do some JavaScript and I

385
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:05,210
pop-up alert box with XSS that's how I

386
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">get that to work and if it's going to</font>

387
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,410
work for me will do see those Devils

388
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,030
here but as you can see it goes very

389
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,790
well into depth and many other pages

390
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:16,190
have these kind of documentation and

391
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,470
built-in help in line so you don't have

392
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,750
to worry about Oh visit come back and

393
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:23,720
chase down rabbit holes that's all right

394
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,430
there with you and so everybody learns

395
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,960
differently I learned from<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading I've</font>

396
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,180
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for videos I people learn</font>

397
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">from doing your hands on keyboards and</font>

398
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,550
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it really does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help us</font>

399
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,290
as possible integrate all those

400
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,690
different learning methods into one

401
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,399
cohesive area and so with that there's

402
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">also youtube</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> links i don't have also</font>

403
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,910
said never counted right now but i would

404
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,820
click that link i would get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lynch so I</font>

405
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:50,540
mean how i would do I HP only cookies

406
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:52,370
attempt ostrich 15 so with that Jeremy

407
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,889
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> lautner narration for these videos</font>

408
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,320
he goes through and explains to the user

409
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,540
you know natalie like in a condescending

410
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,879
manner but like he also was way

411
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,110
passionate about this project and want

412
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,030
everybody learned from this and for

413
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,310
motility and what it can offer to the

414
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,830
community and help us as a whole

415
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:12,889
developers testers as well to really

416
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:16,399
just it will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn from kind</font>

417
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:18,110
of look from each other from these kind

418
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,740
of attacks and how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can better</font>

419
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:27,020
ourselves in our applications and so

420
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:28,600
command objection so let's try to let's

421
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:33,610
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see if we can good</font>

422
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:38,080
some good magics here all right that's

423
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">right thing a lot will host okay luck we</font>

424
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:49,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">should see below that we should see baby</font>

425
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:49,889
woke up for our<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

426
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,929
as important

427
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,470
to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the this is a</font>

428
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,179
user-generated field so the user has

429
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,920
full control with the influence<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

430
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:04,570
filled up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developer not</font>

431
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,730
necessarily the web browser to protect

432
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,678
against the sanitized input of what the

433
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:12,300
user is putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that field so host</font>

434
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:15,250
it could be google com an IP address and

435
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:18,760
from here we would see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would get</font>

436
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:21,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">a return field of the all right that's</font>

437
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,100
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we see that's been timed out</font>

438
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,510
no service can be reached great so

439
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,040
that's fine that's what we want to see

440
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,070
right we want to see these are entering

441
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,260
of data we look up dns and get some the

442
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:35,620
server returning back some message so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

443
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:38,140
know that somewhere aunt application

444
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,239
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put this information in its going</font>

445
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,370
out doing some kind of s look up or some

446
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,860
kind of command so it's talking to the

447
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,620
host OS do information wearing it back

448
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:51,100
and who knows what kind of sanitation is

449
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:53,590
performed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that users input to form</font>

450
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:57,669
this look up so we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect to see</font>

451
00:21:53,590 --> 00:22:00,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know the website author is like</font>

452
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:03,130
opposite is entering google com or in

453
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:06,610
the sent over an IP address no one would

454
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,530
ever do attacks that would help remise

455
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:12,309
website I mean why would have I do that

456
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:18,190
that's not what along so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see also</font>

457
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:21,000
as well on firefox that we have returned

458
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,000
that same field back

459
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:27,480
so now I've better did a basic cost at

460
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:30,749
ripping attack and so we wait patiently

461
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:38,090
so patiently for what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it did come back</font>

462
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to us so chrome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alla box up to date</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

463
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:44,730
determine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unreal</font>

464
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,200
happened so with that the attack went

465
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,879
through we didn't get kind of errors

466
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,399
when you get the kind of feedback they

467
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:52,590
tap went through however comma chrome

468
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:56,309
being an s it is google does<font color="#E5E5E5"> louisville</font>

469
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:58,949
kind of sometimes they also<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect the</font>

470
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:01,769
user from these basic attacks so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

471
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:04,529
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we try to our JavaScript we try</font>

472
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:09,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to generate an alert</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pop-up box up in</font>

473
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:14,159
arms firefox a little different so we

474
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,740
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox return one we were able</font>

475
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,360
to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sanitize input we put</font>

476
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,850
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript and we can see one</font>

477
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,979
popped up could be a prop know like all

478
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:26,459
great I see a one that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a that's</font>

479
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:29,070
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deal right no but just go back</font>

480
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:32,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of passing various browsers</font>

481
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:34,860
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I were to do my tests or chrome looks</font>

482
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:37,049
good no<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop-ups right but for paradox</font>

483
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,029
obviously that website still is horrible

484
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:41,158
I mean depending on our tools you still

485
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:43,169
have hot pad depending on what was ran

486
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,029
or what happened but still it's

487
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:47,460
important to note that it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you</font>

488
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:49,169
do one tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> line go through and even on</font>

489
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,149
their tools have their manual testing

490
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:52,980
methods as well so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good to</font>

491
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:55,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a multiple set of eyes on the same</font>

492

493
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:58,429
procedures and method so you've been

494
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,490
consistent it makes

495
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:05,149
great coverage to show that you're

496
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,860
actually testing and not just you know

497
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:12,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">running and gunning with what you need</font>

go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll go this is google</font>

500
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:20,090
again so we'll show a log will go

501
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:25,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">through a second ordered reflective</font>

502
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:27,559
attacks and so mattila day so helpful

503
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:30,350
has a log of everything how the user

504
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:33,139
puts into the application so as you can

505
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,908
imagine we'll probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> see our 127 00</font>

506
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:36,979

510
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:51,740
how the website handles<font color="#E5E5E5"> users input so</font>

511
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:53,840
while we let that spit up at this that's

512
00:24:51,740 --> 00:25:01,450
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right we'll do the same</font>

513
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:01,449
in firefox browser OV

514
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:13,730
second dress apart I know Phoenix go

515
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:19,300
through an aside<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so slowly and</font>

516
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:19,300
browsing through no dinosaurs here

517
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:26,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so a lot of it that's low</font>

518
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:29,229
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different projects that</font>

519
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:31,450
we have available<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us so as I</font>

520
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:34,839
mentioned you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know big deal we had a one</font>

521
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:36,369
pop up who cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so there's a lot</font>

522
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:37,839
of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> vectors of attack that we</font>

523
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:41,168
have been through cross-site scripting

524
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:44,440
now if I were a bad guy I mom gesture as

525
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:47,229
you know what do I would try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say okay</font>

526
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,009
I can get that one to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen what if I</font>

527
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:54,339
were to pass through that attack you

528
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:58,509
know modified not up alert box one but

529
00:25:54,339 --> 00:26:01,839
if I try to do a hook what is there's a

530
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:04,839
project called beef beef is a great

531
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,999
project open source as well and so with

532
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:08,950
that if you have it in that with a

533
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:13,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">cross-match</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scripting you might have a</font>

534
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:15,279
ninja look that user so trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

535
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:18,539
quickly to surmise that with beef it

536
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,829
allows you to inject payloads into

537
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:23,408
various different scenarios one of them

538
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:26,559
is a cross-match scripting and so rather

539
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:28,779
than pushing through alert one<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put in</font>

540
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,019
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript that pops and lows so</font>

541
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:35,349
lets user browse this website i injected

542
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:37,719
through through<font color="#CCCCCC"> breaks Mathis i bought a</font>

543
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:40,089
pop in through this hooking<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript</font>

544
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:42,039
so these are does really<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what</font>

545
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:44,139
happens might be a pop-up nothing

546
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,479
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> me pay at all but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now on the</font>

547
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:49,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">back end as the attacker i now have</font>

548
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:51,070
control of that users pc I've exploited

549
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:53,259
website that these are browse and now I

550
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:55,119
can exploit through that different ways

551
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:58,179
and brief<font color="#E5E5E5"> American retrieve credentials</font>

552
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:01,749
tokens any number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things that through</font>

a simple alert<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I compromise that to</font>

compromise<font color="#CCCCCC"> an user and potentially</font>

555
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:07,690
website itself there's a number of ways

556
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:10,329
to be compromised and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so while may seem</font>

557
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:14,139
trivial one popped up it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

558
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:17,799
trivial at all so I just solved with

559
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:20,708
that Dana's<font color="#CCCCCC"> lookup entered in our output</font>

560
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:23,109
entered it in our input received out

561
00:27:20,709 --> 00:27:25,239
nothing but we browse through this log

562
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:27,549
and this log shows all the users input

563
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:31,029
that was entered through various<font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

564
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:33,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so chrome to help us this time and</font>

00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:34,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">again through here we just browse the</font>
