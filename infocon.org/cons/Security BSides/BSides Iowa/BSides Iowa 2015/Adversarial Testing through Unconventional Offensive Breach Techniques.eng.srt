1
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's one of our sponsors this year</font>

2
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:00,670
Aziz night so thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for coming and</font>

3
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:06,880
sponsoring and also presented this talk

4
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:08,800
so sorry all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah good afternoon</font>

5
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,410
guys thanks for showing up to our talk

6
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:16,810
and everyone hear me yeah thumbs up

7
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:19,770
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is a adversarial</font>

8
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,610
simulation testing its unconventional

9
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,750
offensive breach techniques so

10
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,160
essentially we're not going to be

11
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,550
dropping<font color="#CCCCCC"> oday or anything like that</font>

12
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,289
we're basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk through</font>

13
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:33,190
more offensive techniques that we run

14
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:36,729
into so just to really go into the

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,410
agenda we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start with</font>

16
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,210
introductions everyone has the

17
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,160
obligatory of introductions then we're

18
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,690
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into a coffee break we're</font>

19
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,860
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an overview we're gonna</font>

20
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,970
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> another coffee break I need you</font>

21
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys had barbecue so that's why I'm</font>

22
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,920
saying this breach simulation why what

23
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,699
it is how does it compare it to

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,380
traditional testing case studies and

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,090
again another coffee break another

26
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,360
coffee break and that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

27
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,910
deal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you know ask you know what</font>

28
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,090
all the questions have fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the talk</font>

29
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:08,978
we want to really hear experiences and

30
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,209
things like that as well so when we get

31
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,490
towards the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're doing the QA</font>

32
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:14,560
hopefully we have tons of time for Q&A

33
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,810
we definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of have an</font>

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,810
interactive conversation so without

35
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">further ado my name is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chris patten i'm</font>

36
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,220
actually a director for the advanced

37
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,400
services group at fishnet we primarily

38
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:32,560
focus on adversarial testing so you guys

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,610
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have heard it as red teaming might</font>

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,640
get into that here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there but</font>

41
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,530
essentially essentially do a blended

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,940
assessments so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage things like</font>

43
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:45,069
social engineering physical security

44
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,960
basically logical<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentesting those sorts</font>

45
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:49,869
of things and blend all of these and we

46
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,820
an organization right we don't attack

47
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:57,800
individual things assets systems we

48
00:02:52,820 --> 00:03:00,980
attack an organization my background I

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,010
was in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> military so I was I was Air</font>

50
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,420
Force I move to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you telecommunications</font>

51
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,850
been in the industry in various

52
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,640
capacities for 20-plus years been with

53
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,290
fishnet for four and a half years and I

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,630
primarily just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing the</font>

55
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,090
penetration testing etc and now we have

56
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">this group and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> damned I have been kind</font>

57
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">of traveling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around all over the place</font>

58
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,269
public for the last last two years

59
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:26,239
performing these offensive engagements

60
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,310
like this thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah my name is Dan</font>

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,550
Cobin I'm a principal consultant with

62
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,200
fishnet I<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> team that that</font>

63
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,320
Chris here leads up i've been with

64
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,690
fishnet for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> four years been</font>

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,609
consulting for about eight primarily

66
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,930
focused on pet testing but you know

67
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,760
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got more into these kind of</font>

68
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,200
blended assessments we're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

69
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,600
demand for it especially with some of

70
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the high-profile breaches</font>

71
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,010
that that we're seeing more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently</font>

72
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,770
so that's kind of why we've we've

73
00:03:52,010 --> 00:04:00,070
developed a talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think today to kind</font>

74
00:03:54,770 --> 00:04:03,800
of focus on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that so okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

75
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,720
really objectives let's define an

76
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:10,070
adversarial simulation and ate a breach

77
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:13,430
assessment or breach simulation and that

78
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:16,010
is kind of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of distill all of</font>

79
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,209
this out here momentarily but that's

80
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,029
that's kind of what we want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

81
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:22,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to we want to understand what the</font>

82
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,530
departure is from existing offensive

83
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,210
testing and transition that over to

84
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,549
these these more involved breach

85
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,690
assessments contrast traditional

86
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,420
penetration testing and breach

87
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,400
simulation I will talk about the pros

88
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,120
and the cons essentially why you want to

89
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,320
do it why you wouldn't want to do it

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,870
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about organizational</font>

91
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,460
maturity you probably heard about the

92
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,760
capability maturity model I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

93
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go much into that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it really does</font>

94
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,570
it does feed into kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the overall</font>

95
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,909
reasons why we would want to perform a

96
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,960
breach assessment expected outcomes

97
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:57,370
these are the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

98
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,320
organization can actually learn from so

99
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,389
we definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> want we want to understand</font>

100
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,310
some of the items that<font color="#CCCCCC"> come out of a</font>

101
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:05,139
breach assessment that are a little bit

102
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of the norm that we would typically</font>

103
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,190
receive from s feedback from from

104
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,610
sacristan attrition test or something to

105
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,860
that effect and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then really the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rules in</font>

106
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,100
a security problem are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

107
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:20,050
of program why we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce this</font>

108
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:26,290
sort of testing overall into an

109
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:27,360
organization security program so let's

110
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,360
talk about penetration test

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,710
organizations go through they have a

112
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,940
requirement<font color="#CCCCCC"> to perform a penetration</font>

113
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,359
test they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a requirement for a</font>

114
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,949
system a host a network they have a new

115
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,940
product that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to bet they want</font>

116
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:44,470
to depend test so to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a vendor</font>

117
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,419
the problem with the penetration test is

118
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,039
that you hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like it should be</font>

119
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:49,780
comprehensive and should target all of

120
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,919
all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know all the surfaces</font>

121
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,630
all about all the operating systems

122
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,340
applications that exist on it that sort

123
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,669
of thing it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> only leverage one</font>

124
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,440
attack vector so maybe you get in and

125
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:04,180
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing you concentrate</font>

126
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,400
what can you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you make that</font>

127
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,010
initial initial breach once you make

128
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,690
that initial compromise it should

129
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,190
leverage one or all of the attack

130
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,110
vectors maybe they're more concerned

131
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,760
about identifying all of the services

132
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then seeing if there's motor</font>

133
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,180
abilities associated with both those

134
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,500
services and then attacking those to see

135
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,639
if there's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know see where they can</font>

136
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,580
get rights more of a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

137
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,889
comprehensive approach the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing</font>

138
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,880
that we we did quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit is leaving</font>

139
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:34,419
the shields up or down so is IPS hids

140
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,440
hits that sort of thing depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

141
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:40,409
compliance functions so say for instance

142
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,539
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a PCI assessment right</font>

143
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:45,729
one of the big things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know to</font>

144
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:48,190
perform a PCI engagement they want to

145
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring the shields down and assess the</font>

146
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,400
underlying vulnerability so they get a

147
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:56,800
true understanding of the underlying

148
00:06:51,400 --> 00:07:00,400
risk risk exposure or if they leave them

149
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,650
up then at that point you're essentially

150
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,929
testing the effectiveness of an IPS or a

151
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,969
prevention like a blocking system but

152
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't necessarily know what the</font>

153
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,620
vulnerability

154
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,810
sure is or the risk exposure is in case

155
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,860
those follower in case those those first

156
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:18,470
line defenses fall over somewhat nothing

157
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,060
more than domain admin right get in

158
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">there get domain admin show me impact</font>

159
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,180
that's it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're that's</font>

160
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,400
what they're concentrated on the

161
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers concentrated on and then</font>

162
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,120
others will say we want it all don't

163
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">leave until you have to get right we</font>

164
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,000
want to we want to own everything right

165
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,469
and so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it comes down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to is</font>

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,450
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on who you ask they have a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">different definition of what entrances</font>

168
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:43,610
yeah you know some some people think

169
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,750
strongly about leaving you know the

170
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,520
shields up you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

171
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,200
penetration test unless you're truly

172
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,630
simulating what an attacker would have

173
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,840
to you know how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to approach a</font>

174
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:56,570
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this all leads to you a</font>

175
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,140
common problem we have an identity

176
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:06,200
crisis right and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy knows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

177
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:08,860
to be a hobby kind of awkward so all

178
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:16,180
right with that we have to ask ourselves

179
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:19,400
have we evolved so as as<font color="#CCCCCC"> organisations</font>

180
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:24,320
delivering the service and as customers

181
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:27,380
receiving that service we feel that we

182
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,420
feel essentially by with the services

183
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the services that</font>

184
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,320
you know whether this is penetration

185
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,320
testing whether these are wireless

186
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:40,750
engagements basically adversarial

187
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:42,590
services there is this perception that

188
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,510
we're providing something with the

189
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,150
client once and at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same time the</font>

190
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,939
client is purchasing something that they

191
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:52,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">think they need right but we still have</font>

192
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:55,160
these problems where we're kind of

193
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,320
breeding assumption right as a vendor

194
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,410
we're breeding assumption as a client

195
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,480
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> our as a customer they have</font>

196
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,100
these assumptions as well we market the

197
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,770
material they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that material vice</font>

198
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,820
versa but no one's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening to</font>

199
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's going on in</font>

200
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:15,320
right things that are driving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

201
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:17,570
industry would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> breeches so we have to</font>

202
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,370
we have to evolve we never give up right

203
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,380
so we need to create something<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are</font>

00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">we going to create a breach simulation</font>

205
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,760
this is what we want to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we</font>

206
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,950
want to address we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to address all</font>

207
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,350
of those use cases out there all those

208
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,090
scenarios where we've got various

209
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,830
breaches going on in the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:39,890
know advanced persistent threat to use

00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:43,969
that cliche that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> buzzword</font>

213
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:47,720
buzzword bingo solid and gently<font color="#CCCCCC"> closed</font>

214
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,250
with bingo so let's let's define brief

215
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,230
simulation real quick and that'll kind

216
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,570
of set the stage on what we're talking

217
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,370
about so a brief simulation focuses on

218
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,980
items or items that are designated<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

219
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:00,380
critical soft hard targets a concept of

chain composite attacks is used

221
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,650
throughout the assessment the CCA or the

change<font color="#E5E5E5"> in violent attack provides a</font>

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:08,329
chronology of attack progression from

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,130
initial unauthorized entry to final

225

compromise the events<font color="#E5E5E5"> are demonstrating</font>

226
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,430
at CCA so the critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> points of</font>

227
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,589
compromise are identified while they

228
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,719
provide relevance about how each lead to

229
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:20,840
subsequent<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's simply</font>

230
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,460
just a fancy way of saying and we use

231
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,950
this internally the chain composite

232
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,810
attack what we want to do in a breach

233
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,370
assessment our bridge simulation as we

234
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,589
won identify that first initial point of

235
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,660
entry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we identify that first</font>

236
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,030
initial point of entry we want to build

237
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,740
those associative relationships so if

238
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">that first vulnerability leads to</font>

239
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,040
something else we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to build that</font>

240
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,480
associative relationship all the way

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,860
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire attack chain and</font>

242
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,020
that's what we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to demonstrate</font>

243
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,810
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end right we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font>

244
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:50,840
care about the breath approach where

245
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,880
we're identifying all of the points of

246
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,420
entry we're only focused on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

247
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,680
critical aspects of the organization

248
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,180
getting to the things that actually make

249
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,439
the organization money intellectual

250
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:05,689
property whatever wherever it might be

251
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,120
and we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build out that chain</font>

252
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,750
composited attack and in the idea the

253
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,890
chain composite attack is

254
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,830
thing too because when you do a

255
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,120
traditional chem test<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those of you</font>

256
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,160
who are in consulting or have to write

257
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,420
up reports you know you have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> context</font>

258
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,860
when you're when you're writing up the

259
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,689
report itself so you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

260
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,310
information disclosure flaw and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

261
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,080
write it up based on what you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

262
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,599
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth however when we perform</font>

263
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,010
breach assessment and we're able to kind

264
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,360
of chain together all these all this

265
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,010
information but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we may find a piece of</font>

266
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,560
information very early on in an

267
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,030
assessment whereas you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know normally</font>

268
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,219
would be a low severity type of thing

269
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,930
and it turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be critical that</font>

270
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,700
it's exposed because we're able to take

271
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that information coupled with something</font>

272
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">else that we found marry the two</font>

273
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,189
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it suddenly becomes a</font>

274
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,650
critical finding on our network right so

275
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,300
it's essentially based in context so if

276
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,439
you have a standalone system that's not

277
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,120
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might be highly vulnerable</font>

278
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,770
but if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not connected to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of</font>

279
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network where it's not doesn't</font>

280
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,730
expose a lot of risk then we're not

281
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to rate that it's not necessarily</font>

282
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,800
a high severity however if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

283
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,069
you know we have another system that

284
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,280
might have a lower severity item but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

285
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:14,070
leads and to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a unexposed</font>

286
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,510
highly confidential or highly secured

287
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,740
environment that at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

288
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:22,980
severity could increase right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

289
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:26,610
a slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said slide by HT more each</font>

290
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:34,500
Moore's law this essentially says it

291
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:37,100
demonstrates<font color="#CCCCCC"> really kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of where where</font>

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,680

293
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:44,130
really how different different

294
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,540
organizations are<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage their I guess</font>

295
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,660
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> they leverage their focus right</font>

296
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,969
where they leverage their focus on so

297
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,180
we're saying skills first verse threat

298
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,280
actors right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and this this is when</font>

299
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,170
you have say for instance on to the far

300
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,920
left you have your auditor Assessor

301
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:04,050
right that's a low skill and it's no

302
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,790
offense to any auditors or Assessors but

303
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,709
you know that's that's kind of where we

304
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:11,219
live in like a compliance compliance

305
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:13,200
world as we move towards the right we

306
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,550
start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into penetration testing</font>

307
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll kind of start to see this this</font>

308
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:20,640
yellow line come down and and that's

309
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine because we're kind of siloed in</font>

310
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,160
area we're siloed in say for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance a</font>

311
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:27,960
system a host a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and</font>

312
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,730
at that point we're performing

313
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:34,340
penetration<font color="#E5E5E5"> tests say against those</font>

314
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:36,960
items so at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we have</font>

315
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,510
we're kind of restricted kind of

316
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,310
constraint however we move towards the

317
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,530
right then at that point that's kind of

318
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,829
where we live in a breach assessment we

319
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:50,280
take more of the organized<font color="#CCCCCC"> crime</font>

320
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:53,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">syndicates more of espionage so far</font>

321
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,750
right there where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn a lot</font>

322
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,040
of this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to leverage</font>

323
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,900
a lot of the information that we learn

324
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,750
we have to assess a lot of the targets

325
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,329
but we still want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to maintain Cobert</font>

326
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:06,540
covert operative throughout the entire

327
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:10,890
the entire engagement to kind of help

328
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:14,790
that out and to visualize this if we

329
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:17,010
have if we have an individual like a

330
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,689
traditional assessment say for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance</font>

331
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,330
up in the upper<font color="#CCCCCC"> left-hand corner we'll</font>

332
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">call that a logical assessment right</font>

333
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,180
that could be again that can be a

334
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,470
wireless assessment that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

335
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,170
vulnerability assessment that could be a

336
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:30,300
penetration test within that that's kind

337
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,870
of a siloed context right you're going

338
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,670
to perform<font color="#E5E5E5"> an assessment and you're</font>

339
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,610
going to exploit those vulnerabilities

340
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:42,030
in a breath breath approach and you're

341
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:45,000
going to not really have much concern

342
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,650
for all of the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those those areas</font>

343
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,080
those circles those physical assessments

344
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,090
those Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent recon the social the</font>

345
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,340
social assessment etc right these are

346
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,670
all kind of performed in their own

347
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:58,320
perspective their own isolated silo now

348
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,900
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to the breach assessment</font>

349
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,900
the breach assessment takes in pretty

350
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,510
much all facets of those different

351
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">disciplines so we have we have bleed</font>

352
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,510
over from a logical assessment from a

353
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">visible assessment from the social</font>

354
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,870
assessment and from ascend Rica and I've

355
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,970
broken them out like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because it's</font>

356
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,070
typically what we run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into for logical</font>

357
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,140
we run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into things like penetration</font>

358
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,700
testing you know we have system

359
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,230
vulnerabilities we have network

360
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,140
vulnerabilities we have wireless

361
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,790
vulnerabilities etc physical assessments

362
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,830
we have vulnerabilities that are

363
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,290
associated with dwellings maybe security

364
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,940
security folks aren't man 24 hours maybe

365
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:38,599
they have ineffective entry points

366
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:40,770
egress points maybe they have you know

367
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,780
ineffective match provisioning systems

368
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,730
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely leverage a lot of that</font>

369
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then social assessments</font>

370
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,550
it's essentially the social engineering

371
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,970
aspect maybe we need to make a telephone

372
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:53,069
telephone pretexting calls in order to

373
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:56,400
gain access maybe we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send in a</font>

374
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:58,290
spear fish you know something to that

375
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,850
effect in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain that initial</font>

376
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,069
entry point it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just necessarily</font>

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,260
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> entry the initial entry point but</font>

378
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:06,360
that could happen throughout you know

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:10,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the entire network chain throughout the</font>

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,810
entire composite chained attack now with

folks talking about really you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means so bow set reconnaissance</font>

00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">information gathering essentially we're</font>

385
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,900
going out to public domain we're looking

386
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">for all the things that we can leverage</font>

387
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,430
to target an organization whether that's

388
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,610
technologies that have been exposed job

389
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,930
resumes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are out there anything</font>

390
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,760
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> media we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

391
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,489
entire profiles based on a single person

392
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,960
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> did an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engagement where I called</font>

393
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,390
into a financial organization I built

394
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,740
the entire profile based on just this

395
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one guy's social media presence</font>

396
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,580
right and when I called in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

397
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,720
place to phone pretext call and I was

398
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,750
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise the account three</font>

399
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,980
different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's it's like those</font>

400
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,900
sorts of things that you're able to

401
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">build leverage that's good information</font>

402
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,520
but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only that sliver in the</font>

403
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,170
middle that's useful and that's your

404
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">Intel that's your intelligence that's</font>

405
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,800
actionable information right that's the

406
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff that we want to look that we want</font>

407
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">to leverage the stuff that we actually</font>

408
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,579
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use in the bridge simulation</font>

409
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:12,740
that's what we're going to end up

410
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,740
leveraging to actually gain gain access

411
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:19,149
okay so this this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just puts a</font>

412
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:22,300
side-by-side the traditional pen test

413
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,500
and the bridge simulation we want to

414
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,688
<font color="#CCCCCC">still have to run through all of these</font>

415
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,780
but it just kind of highlights the

416
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:30,700
differences in<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach or the</font>

417
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,590
differences between the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as Chris</font>

418
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,690
mentioned the approach on a traditional

419
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,070
chem test is a breadth-first approach

420
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,600
right we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be comprehensive in</font>

421
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:41,320
nature we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pretty much touch</font>

422
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,820
all all you know in scope systems all

423
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,770
reports you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to test all</font>

424
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">the things basically whereas you know</font>

425
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,580
breach assessment is more targeted will

426
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,899
really care we care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a depth</font>

427
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,850
first approach we want to see how deep

428
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,770
we can get we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care about testing</font>

429
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,760
every single host on the network we care

430
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,950
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that's going to get us</font>

431
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,870
access right and then beyond that we

432
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,520
care about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> step that's</font>

433
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get us further access you know</font>

434
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,870
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about testing everything</font>

435
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,780
attack vectors as Chris mentioned in

436
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,610
that last slide you know a traditional

437
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,940
test is really logical only whereas a

438
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:16,360
breach assessment is it kind of Mary's

439
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:18,010
all of those together let's see well the

440
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,500
ones are<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably worth measuring our</font>

441
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,230
worth mentioning so very measurable yeah

442
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,059
the severity measurement the traditional

443
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,160
will use something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdss right</font>

444
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:29,710
industry standard whereas a breach

445
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,120
actually uses demonstrated risk so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

446
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,010
mentioned before you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

447
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">information disclosure flaw you know</font>

448
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:38,230
without context it may be low severity

449
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:41,190
maybe a<font color="#E5E5E5"> three point O cdss core but when</font>

450
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:44,380
we couple it with maybe I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know a</font>

451
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:47,050
physical security flaw maybe the two of

452
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:51,940
those combine to create a high severity

453
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:54,600
finding also worth mentioning the tool

454
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,990
sets we use are quite different

455
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:01,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">contest is really just a laptop and</font>

456
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:02,789
breach we have a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools beyond</font>

457
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,799
just that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most</font>

458
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:06,390
important pieces as we've kind of talked

459
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,730
about already up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this point is the</font>

460
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,289
context traditional contest has no

461
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,970
context really I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're just</font>

462
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,410
testing you you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

463
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,910
what's most importantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font>

464
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,940
care because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing comprehensive</font>

465
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:20,490
type test<font color="#CCCCCC"> whereas a breach assessment</font>

466
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,840
the context does matter where you find

467
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,809
that vulnerability does matter

468
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially if you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to pivot</font>

469
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:29,309
internally or couple it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know</font>

470
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,870
another finding so the tool set is that

471
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:33,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I was like yeah we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

472
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,939

00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,980
aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is evasive pneus so with</font>

474
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,020
traditionals so traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

475
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,400
traditional techniques you might run

476
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,549
into those occasional smash-and-grab

477
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,330
type situations but from the most part

478
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:49,740
the traditionals are over in nature

479
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,809
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're more you're more</font>

480
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerned about the overall vulnerable</font>

481
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:56,210
state of those those subjects are those

482
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:59,250
those items that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> subject to review</font>

483
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:02,250
whereas in breach assessments we want to

484
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,870
maintain complete you know what

485
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,980
agreement anonymous we want to maintain

486
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:09,570
covert and then the other really really

487
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,309
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> part when we are executing</font>

488
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,020
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's for anyone who's</font>

489
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,149
doing red team's or think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about doing</font>

490
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,400
red team's compartmentalizing the folks

491
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,400
that know in the organization so you

492
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,690
have to have executive sponsorship

493
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,799
that's critical otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project is</font>

494
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,970
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go sideways and when it goes</font>

495
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,090
sideways it's going to be a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nasty</font>

496
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,559
thing but so you definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have</font>

497
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">the executive sponsorship but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

498
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,010
want all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your executives to know you</font>

499
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:33,720
probably need critical people like me to

500
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,770
your physical building your physical

501
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,820
maintenance if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a campus</font>

502
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,590
environment you definitely want those

503
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,559
folks to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know at least one person who</font>

504
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">now points the best escalation you need</font>

505
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,928
indemnification clauses so essentially

506
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,879
your get out of jail free letters right

507
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:49,620
so it tells you what's in violence

508
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,000
what's out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bounds your backup</font>

509
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,059
contacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's going to be performing</font>

510
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">the performing the engagement etc these</font>

511
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,418
are all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cover your ass sorts of</font>

512
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:02,908
sorts of things but it's definitely

513
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:04,049
lessons learned so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> would we do the</font>

514
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide really why would we do a</font>

515
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:10,470
breach assessment because in 2014

516
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,909
documented 131 breaches some of them

517
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we didn't necessarily hear about</font>

518
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:16,110
and then some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them are big obviously</font>

519
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">big targets right we've got we've got</font>

520
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:23,639
home depot<font color="#E5E5E5"> jpmorgan ebay michaels stores</font>

521
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:25,679
and then you know through throughout all

522
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,289
of those definitely lots of intellectual

523
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:33,000
property lots of credit cards disclosed

524
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:34,950
things that can things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can impact</font>

525
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,870
brand defamation they you know maybe

526
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,580
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a monetary association</font>

527
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,870
around that but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you if you</font>

528
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,699
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quantify that that's going to be</font>

529
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,020
you know brand detonation stuff like a

530
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,789
bleep into that so you've got both cual

531
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,990
you can qualify<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things you find</font>

532
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:48,440
those things it just depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

533
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:52,740
truly<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it one of the biggest ones</font>

534
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,260
was obviously target right so there's a

535
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,500
this quite a cannula lessons learned

536
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,970
with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right enough of</font>

537
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,710
my ranking we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

538
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">some case studies so this is kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

539
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:07,669
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the meat of it is this is</font>

540
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:11,100
really kind of we've we've gone through

541
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:14,240
three separate scenarios the first

542
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:17,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">scenario is more associated with</font>

543
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,150
financial organization the second

544
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:22,199
scenarios associated with medical

545
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,730
organization and the third is with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

546
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,549
large insurance so these are all big

547
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:30,539
fortune you know fortune 100 500

548
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:32,129
whatever companies yeah and we put

549
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:35,429
together case studies we think they're

550
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:38,880
kind of maybe the best basis for kind of

551
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:41,970
studying the advantages of a breach

552
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,650
assessment because we can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

553
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,179
highlight a number of findings and

554
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,770
you'll see some repeats between the

555
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,880
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> different scenarios we lay up but</font>

556
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,860
we can highlight<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the findings</font>

557
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,870
that you know your traditional<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test</font>

558
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,309
is definitely not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find and we</font>

559
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,020
can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of highlight some of the</font>

560
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:58,139
points where you know if you're not

561
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:00,539
chaining together vulnerabilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> or if</font>

562
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,200
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that processes you have</font>

563
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:03,029
in place

564
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,610
important well you know we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you</font>

565
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:06,779
otherwise you know these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the types</font>

566
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,539
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that a breach assessment can</font>

567
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:10,860
highlight it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a cute but they</font>

568
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,799
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good stories you'll see</font>

569
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:17,850
so the stores are very interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

570
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:19,620
so before we actually get started to set

571
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,199
the context we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of go</font>

572
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,760
through some tools of the trade so these

573
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,590
aren't necessarily standardized tools

574
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,879
that you would typically see on normal

575
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:32,730
pen tester or normal normal engagements

576
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,460
so with these we kind of yeah so it got

577
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:39,960
locksmith locksmith<font color="#E5E5E5"> inna tools so we</font>

578
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:42,659
have like bump keys we yeah bump keys so

579
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,289
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially we have you know lock</font>

580
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:48,299
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bump keys those sorts of things</font>

581
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:50,879
those are basically just leverage to get

582
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:52,918
past you know physical access right we

583
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,950
run into situations where we need to

584
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,480
bypass the door this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font>

585
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,159
external perimeter door it might be an

586
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,570
internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> for might be an internal door</font>

587
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,059
so we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like gain</font>

588
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,740
gain an initial access in order to get a

589
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:07,710
logical foothold in the organization we

590
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,720
want to place say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prince with malicious</font>

591
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:12,179
device right so in that particular

592
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,279
instance we use things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

593
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,380
a poem flood right and it's running a

594
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:19,230
full version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a full version of Linux</font>

595
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,570
with metasploit on it you've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

596
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:24,539
the Pony Express right right up nigga

597
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,668
cost 14 bucks other advice on my dad box

598
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:29,190
you can build your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> this costs 150</font>

599
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:31,320
bucks I mean yeah so shoot before dad's

600
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:33,539
cheapo plug but yeah it's sweet<font color="#CCCCCC"> st. just</font>

601
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,840
plug it into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network you know looks</font>

602
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:38,970
like a power device waiver plug it into

603
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,860
power plug it into a network jack and it

604
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,690
establishes a backdoor connection so let

605
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,260
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up to establish a VPN</font>

606
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:50,030
connection

607
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:52,379
to our labs yep cold beat software so

608
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,149
kon boot is one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a</font>

609
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,650
that you know once we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do gain</font>

610
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,350
access and these are this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is physical</font>

611
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,130
access to the system right and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

612
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:01,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">really what we want to do is establish</font>

613
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,190
that initial Foothill persistence get

614
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,240
out of the building if you stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

615
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,890
building too long you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

616
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">caught right so we just want to get in</font>

617
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:10,470
get out so with cold boot software

618
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,510
essentially we can accommodate it's a

619
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:16,950
perfect example we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually boot</font>

620
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:18,600
into the bios boot<font color="#CCCCCC"> palm boot kombi will</font>

621
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,550
actually rewrite or patch up the

622
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication process and then at that</font>

623
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,000
point we can just log in local admin

624
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,179
without password right and that allows

625
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,610
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drop drop shell drop whatever we</font>

626
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:32,340
need to do to establish a establish a

627
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:35,040
persistent connection the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

628
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:39,330
that we typically do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we we have RFID</font>

629
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:41,940
badge planners emulators yeah so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

630
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:44,580
just a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cool DIY Kickstarter</font>

631
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:47,910
project our fiddler and that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

632
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,699
to actually basically clone a vast

633
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:53,610
majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of proximity carts so if we</font>

634
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,900
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> refined badges on employees well if</font>

635
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,399
we find badges that our land around

636
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,170
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that effect then we can</font>

637
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,670
clone those badges recreate them and

638
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,980
then come back at a later time to

639
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:05,750
actually be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gain access to the</font>

640
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:09,030
building we talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Road devices</font>

641
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:11,160
the other thing that we kind of

642
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:13,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">downsized right we try to carry as much</font>

643
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,510
power as we possibly can without having

644
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,669
a big form factor so we just use like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

645
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:20,340
little Nexus sentence that are running

646
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,720
colleague<font color="#CCCCCC"> Manhunter allows us pretty</font>

647
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">much a full-blown version of Linux we</font>

648
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,510
can drop in a shell we can pretty much

649
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,919
do anything that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do we have</font>

650
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,020
you know micro USB connectors that

651
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,010
allowance that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can access that sort</font>

652
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,590
of thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not looking around</font>

653
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:36,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mac</font>

654
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:37,899
around a bunch of extra dinner and then

655
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:40,809
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we end up doing phone</font>

656
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:43,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">scooping we were in ass first pbx is so</font>

657
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:45,820
we can actually expand impersonate help

658
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,830
desk maybe we can impersonate vendors

659
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:50,408
etc that might have a relationship with

660
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:52,570
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization that we're attacking so</font>

661
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,279
this is this might lead to initial

662
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,700
football or it might lead to an

663
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,809
additional foothold win<font color="#E5E5E5"> where once we're</font>

664
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,010
actually with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know within the</font>

665
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:01,960
organization which we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

666
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,940
of persistence and then finally I think

667
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is most important one most</font>

668
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,929
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts is just having having</font>

669
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,330
you know skills in general but<font color="#E5E5E5"> software</font>

670
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:12,070
development skills if<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you hire vendor</font>

671
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,178
and they come in and they're like okay

672
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,070
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit on</font>

673
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:17,559
you or something about in fact to try to

674
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,120
get an out bombshell and you expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

675
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:20,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">to work in here you're you know you're</font>

676
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,729
pacified with that answer that's fine

677
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,830
but in you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our experience if</font>

678
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:30,130
you're able to code and able to develop

679
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:32,350
your own see two connections you know

680
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:35,289
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to command and control servers then</font>

681
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:38,590
you have a much better you have much

682
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:41,649
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> probability of extracting and</font>

683
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,939
actually exfiltrating data and all you

684
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:46,149
call you know in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

685
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:48,940
establishing persistent connectivity and

686
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:51,820
one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't include</font>

687
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:54,460
and the tools of the trade is that we've

688
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:58,139
leveraged a lot of cloud-based VPS

689
00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:00,100
services so we for our<font color="#E5E5E5"> C to server</font>

690
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,320
implementation a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times when we're</font>

691
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,908
trying to send shells or send

692
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,529
connections once we've compromised to an

693
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:09,159
organization will send the shelves out

694
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:14,320
to these cloud based organizations that

695
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:16,120
way we can one stand up multiple see two

696
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,980
servers in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> event that</font>

697
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,949
actually one does get compromised we can

698
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:23,679
move into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different region so I think</font>

699
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,990
the pic on<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital ocean a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great so</font>

700
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,360
but digital Asian block r.i.p you know

701
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,950
yeah customers can block our IPS left

702
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,990
and right and just switch instance yeah

703
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:34,179
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's a cat-and-mouse game</font>

704
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,460
yeah yeah so like that way like it you

705
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:37,500
know if we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got if we have an eye</font>

706
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">addressing VPS that's in San</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco</font>

707
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,309
no like okay what would block to you so

708
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,309
we just bounce over to say for instance

709
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:45,899
you know Amsterdam or over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to over to</font>

710
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:48,090
Germany they just turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a new</font>

711
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:49,709
hosting facility in Germany so now like

712
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:52,799
we can bounce all over the place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

713
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,659
nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that we can clone we can</font>

714
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,100
clone our<font color="#CCCCCC"> bps image and just move it</font>

715
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,169
over we just basically just transition

716
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,649
it and bring it right back up we're back

717
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:02,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">in business we just shovel our</font>

718
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:04,770
connection over to the new IP address

719
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:07,020
and we're good to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a nice API</font>

720
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,549
to so eventually we're working on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

721
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,860
eventually we should be able to do that

722
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:12,779
probably from a nap or something on our

723
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">smartphone so if we're physically on</font>

724
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:16,860
site and we have trouble getting back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

725
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">our current</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instance we can spin up</font>

726
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,449
another one you know based on just

727
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,639
client-side calls that you know we have

728
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,010
developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you forgot to mention also</font>

729
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,659
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile of the trade that has only</font>

730
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,460
been used once on an engagement<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

731
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:32,100
grappling hook but it's actually

732
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,110
beautiful only<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it once $25 of an</font>

733
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,178
army surplus store that's $25 I've ever

734
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,129
spent I got that call that was a great

735
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,600
call yeah it's okay we need a good no

736
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,830
joke<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was like what the hell do you</font>

737
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,529
need a graph way it was a legitimate

738
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:45,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">attack vendor and it worked ahem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sell</font>

739
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:47,399
yeah ok so the scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> will go in the</font>

740
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,020
scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> but for the grappling hook was</font>

741
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:52,678
that they didn't actually like secure

742
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:55,230
the the the first floor doors were

743
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:57,149
locked but the second floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> they left</font>

744
00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:00,000
the doors unlocked right and there was

745
00:29:57,149 --> 00:30:03,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of like this balcony area grappling</font>

746
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,039
hook right well in the weird thing about

747
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,360
it so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second floor yeah I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

748
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,029
have a picnic tables and stuff there was

749
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,039
no way no way up there from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outside</font>

750
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:13,049
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the building but you could see the</font>

751
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,850
doors from you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ground</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level</font>

752
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:16,590
basically and they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have like a</font>

753
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,959
deadbolt lock but it was on the outside

754
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was visible on the outside like you</font>

755
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,690
know why can you unlock

756
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,639
outside there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> card reader or</font>

757
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,620
anything so we could have just gotten a

758
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,380
ladder we could have rented a ladder but

759
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,770
the guy I was working with wanted to get

760
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:37,049
a VW Bug for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rental car so I don't</font>

761
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:40,260
think it I calm ladder around hopefully

762
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:41,970
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> things with the crossbow no I've</font>

763
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,470
never to the one I was scared as hell I

764
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,360
was scared<font color="#E5E5E5"> as hell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thrown nothing up</font>

765
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,520
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tell you what the first</font>

766
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,770
throw it was perfect it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

767
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:54,480
I couldn't do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> again so this is</font>

768
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">honoring honorable mention because I</font>

769
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,770
didn't feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like dealing with TSA they</font>

770
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:01,260
wouldn't know what that is and I'm just

771
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:05,789
like eh whatever so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know there</font>

772
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:10,590
is the use the company that originally

773
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:13,440
did this he<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed their name yeah</font>

774
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:15,750
Bishop box there we go so they

775
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,049
originally built this so it's basically

776
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:20,940
it's a hid hit bad reader right it's one

777
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:23,879
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big ones so the ones that are</font>

778
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:26,570
like out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> parking lots or whatever so</font>

779
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:30,120
Bishop Fox originally built this thing

780
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:31,889
it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> it allows people to come by</font>

781
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,918
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like unsuspecting victims to</font>

782
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:36,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">come by swipe their proximity badge and</font>

783
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,220
then it reads the information off the

784
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:40,260
proximity badge so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can clone it at a</font>

785
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,510
later date right so you can either take

786
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:49,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">the tape information rebuild it replay</font>

787
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:52,408
it on to you another car yeah so you can

788
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:56,309
replay it<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

789
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:58,740
teapot 5x7 format which is a universal

790
00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:01,440
format the other format is<font color="#E5E5E5"> q5 key fobs</font>

791
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,470
primarily found in the UK but they're

792
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,149
kind of moving away from that so this is

793
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much primary primarily the format</font>

794
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:12,570
so this this hid reader you can

795
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,580
basically just place it up against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

796
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,830
wall maybe use rare earth magnets or

797
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,529
something like that to place on a pole

798
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:20,870
put it out there and as cars are coming

799
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:23,630
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> their swiping their badges</font>

800
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:26,510
just go and grab<font color="#CCCCCC"> it later and and then</font>

801
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:28,070
you have the information to dump it you

802
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,740
know dump it elsewhere and actually

803
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,929
recreate the cards so we built we built

804
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:36,559
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these but we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went a step further</font>

805
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:39,800
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we added more power so it's got a</font>

806
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,139
range of on a little over two maybe two

807
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,000
and a half feet something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

808
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,110
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick those up so you can</font>

809
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,340
actually plan it against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wall and</font>

810
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,459
its people walking through on a hallway

811
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,320
you can pick pick up badge you know

812
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,720
badges that sort of thing it has

813
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:57,470
bluetooth so you can accelerate the

814
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,910
match data out via bluetooth so it's

815
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,490
just got some it's just got some ideas

816
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,740
there to kind of help us not necessarily

817
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,450
again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole idea is not be around</font>

818
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,270
while the attacks are actually happened

819
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:10,490
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever try to remain completely</font>

820
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:13,760
covert and if these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of out of band</font>

821
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:15,559
measures are will facilitate that then

822
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:21,800
by all means that's what we want to bake

823
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:23,030
into these tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> bitch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> final yeah this</font>

824
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,040
one's walkthrough let's walk through

825
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:29,059
some of the cases that Chris was talking

826
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:32,240
about so this first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a financial</font>

827
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:34,190
institution they have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of existing</font>

828
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,340
security practices in place all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font>

829
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:39,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> listed up there it's all pretty</font>

830
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,389
standard I mean really<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the breach</font>

831
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:44,450
assessments when we go about kind of

832
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:46,670
selling these that customers we a lot

833
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,110
most customers who think they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a</font>

834
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:50,150
breach assessment aren't ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

835
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,559
they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have mature security</font>

836
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,570
practices in place they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be doing</font>

837
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:57,080
regular pen tests you know things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

838
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,730
that so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find that all the</font>

839
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,649
cases that we have listed here they all

840
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,929
have pretty good existing security

841
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,780
processes you know things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like de is</font>

842
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:07,180
they have decent GPO

843
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,279
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> tiered callous endpoint security</font>

844
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:15,010
which is pretty pretty standard and

845
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:16,900
pretty useless anyway but yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

846
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,040
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then didn't we on this</font>

847
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,810
particular when we saw randomly

848
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,659
generated domain admin passwords right

849
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:25,989
yeah so that was for that was for the

850
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:27,429
tiered on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry this is an old this</font>

851
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:29,109
isn't for the financial institution some

852
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:30,880
of these listed here this is alden

853
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,500
ignore the HIPAA thing this was for a

854
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:42,970
different example that we have up here

855
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:46,600
but so yeah so the initial composite

856
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:51,730
chained attack vector so<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially</font>

857
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:54,790
this organization we gained access into

858
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization through through the</font>

859
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,940
building through the actual dwelling

860
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,360
through an egress door made our way

861
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:03,040
through into kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this protected huge</font>

862
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,600
kind of skype skyscraper type of

863
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,830
building made our way into the

864
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:10,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization and once we were in there</font>

865
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:12,660
they had pretty much all of the

866
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:17,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">defense's that you'd expect turnstiles</font>

867
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:18,670
badge access to doors etc but again that

868
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,870
all fails when you actually social

869
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,430
engineer your way into the organization

870
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,290
once you actually social engineer your

871
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,629
way into organization you're in there

872
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,160
right you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of kind</font>

873
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:32,400
of ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do do the thing that you're</font>

874
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:34,859
you intended to sew along along those

875
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,230
along those lines while we were in

876
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,760
performing kind of just going going

877
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:41,860
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of evaluating like all</font>

878
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,740
of the the different security controls

879
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,850
basically the entire environment one of

880
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,189
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ended up doing was doing</font>

881
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:50,410
an inventory so we walked we walked

882
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:52,690
through multiple buildings with social

883
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:55,120
engineering buildings multiple floors so

884
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:57,850
social engineered our<font color="#E5E5E5"> way onto those</font>

885
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,650
floors and we went through with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

886
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:01,540
inventory checklist and essentially what

887
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were doing is trying to figure out</font>

888
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we were going to one get some kind</font>

889
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,580
of assistant access because while we're

890
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,390
going through

891
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:11,799
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the logical perimeter</font>

892
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:14,230
review if we weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a whole lot</font>

893
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:18,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">of we weren't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a whole lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

894
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:20,440
leverage by doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so as we're going</font>

895
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,110
walking through and performance

896
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,390
inventory<font color="#E5E5E5"> impersonating employees of the</font>

897
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:27,370
organization we identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a woman</font>

898
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,440
had loved a badge unprotected and this

899
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:31,180
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see right so she</font>

900
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,000
left her badge unprotected on the desk

901
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,410
and in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular instance we just</font>

902
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,570
took that match right she was away from

903
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:39,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ray from her desk she had what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

904
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,930
protected on a person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there was a</font>

905
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were trying to</font>

906
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:44,919
evaluate their first was we definitely

907
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:47,440
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a useful badge that we</font>

908
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,180
would come in after hours maybe in the

909
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,650
morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> early morning hours like you</font>

910
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,089
know 2 a.m. or whatever something like

911
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:57,370
that the other thing that we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

912
00:36:54,090 --> 00:37:00,760
understand is would they decommission a

913
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:03,190
badge if it was reported and or would

914
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,140
they be<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for any kind of event</font>

915
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:07,270
monitoring alerting that would be

916
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:12,069
associated with a badge<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was that</font>

917
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:14,020
was important missing right so later on

918
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:17,560
that evening<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a fast track we left</font>

919
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:21,250
because we had this we came back and at

920
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,230
that point you know blink<font color="#CCCCCC"> dan was kind</font>

921
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,770
of kind of watching from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great</font>

922
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:28,060
distance where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went up to the door</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

923
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:30,009
we've swiped the badge to see if we read

924
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,110
gain entry to see if it would call any

925
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:34,660
of the you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know invoke any Security</font>

926
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:36,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Response incident response appropriate</font>

927
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,200
protocol would be yes we decommission

928
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,569
the badge but we're checking for those

929
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,669
badges and security personnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

930
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:45,310
show up security<font color="#E5E5E5"> personnel didn't show</font>

931
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:47,290
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> so at that point we knew we have it</font>

932
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:50,860
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an entry right so at that point</font>

933
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:54,040
we gained access onto into the

934
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:56,430
organization went through all of the

935
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,410
offices we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> access everywhere</font>

936
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:02,529
primarily went to one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the floors that</font>

937
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:05,430
we originally obtained the badge from as

938
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:09,640
we're reviewing another common<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistake</font>

939
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:12,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">surfaced so they had this particular</font>

940
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,660
organization had locked down<font color="#E5E5E5"> vdi systems</font>

941
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,920
right they had locked down basically

942
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">Citrix virtue</font>

943
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">by Stefan that's desktop system so it</font>

944
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:23,140
was very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to potentially</font>

945
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,339
break out of those but they were it's

946
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,808
not difficult to break out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the citrix</font>

947
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:29,349
don't don't the realm<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's that's very</font>

948
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:31,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy but they had written down a</font>

949
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:34,000
username<font color="#E5E5E5"> and password so at that point</font>

950
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,799
we had a working username password we

951
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,390
checked<font color="#E5E5E5"> that water on there but because</font>

952
00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:40,030
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were using vgi if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shelled that</font>

953
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:41,618
box out as soon as we logged out logged

954
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,150
off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box then we lost that shelf we</font>

955
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:48,250
didn't have privileged accesses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

956
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:50,260
privileged account so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind we kind of</font>

957
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:52,059
rolled in this blended<font color="#E5E5E5"> blended attack</font>

958
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,619
scenario so this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chan composite tag</font>

959
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:55,839
thing we have the actual domain

960
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:57,700
credentials now that you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell how</font>

961
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,140
we got that<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain credentials so we</font>

962
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,089
were in<font color="#CCCCCC"> after hours right and we</font>

963
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually found the credentials written</font>

964
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:04,480
on a sticky note that someone's office

965
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:08,410
yeah did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that yeah yeah so yeah</font>

966
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,900
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we fun so yeah so at that</font>

967
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,450
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I had to I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to</font>

968
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,040
catch a plane or something like that

969
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,210
yeah it was grinding is like Friday up

970
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,270
and yeah so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to the airport</font>

971
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:22,119
dan fires up since uses those

972
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:25,299
credentials pops onto their outlook web

973
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:27,220
access with that puts a malicious

974
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:29,020
payload sends it off to the help<font color="#CCCCCC"> desk</font>

975
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,399
and immediately calls them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and says</font>

976
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey I'm have it difficult to open it up</font>

977
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,210
the you know opening up this document

978
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:40,058
apparently convinces the the helpdesk

979
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">employ to you open the document it's got</font>

980
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:44,650
a malicious VBS script on in the back

981
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,849
that's that's a that's loaded that's

982
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:48,730
going to execute and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fire</font>

983
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:51,460
back doors into server<font color="#E5E5E5"> after some</font>

984
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:54,520
convincing he gets them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to execute it we</font>

985
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:56,670
have access outbound<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the help desk</font>

986
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,740
employee like many<font color="#CCCCCC"> helpdesk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> employees it</font>

987
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,359
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not he's not necessarily run</font>

988
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:04,359
the VDI system he's running a standalone

989
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:08,470
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> standalone workstation and it's also</font>

990
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:10,029
running what was it we have it no he had

991
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:12,640
they had tiered accounts 14

992
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:13,600
non-privileged like everyday use and

993
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,150
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 more</font>

994
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,100
privileged access so like the domain

995
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,050
admins out like a regular you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad</font>

996
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,299
account plus one just for like<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

997
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:25,180
privileged activities problem that we

998
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,680
see more often than not is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

999
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:30,549
pretty convenient to just reuse the same

1000
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:33,339
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> for both cats and that's what</font>

1001
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,900
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so now we have we have shell</font>

1002
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,640
on the administration box so that's our

1003
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,680
first chain right that's that's kind of

1004
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,850
our additional chain vector so now we're

1005
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:44,259
going to chant we're changing the chain

1006
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:46,360
composite attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so now we</font>

1007
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,510
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to because we have access to that</font>

1008
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">box now we have some level of well</font>

1009
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:54,240
because we have some level of access we

1010
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,960
need to establish persistence so we

1011
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,279
turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

1012
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">what are you yeah so after we got domain</font>

1013
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:06,580
admin access so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we just accessed</font>

1014
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,590
a domain controller and interestingly

1015
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,750
their domain controllers and servers

1016
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:12,400
were allowed to talk outbound which you

1017
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:13,870
know there's really no reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your</font>

1018
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,770
server should need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk out over the</font>

1019
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:19,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet so what we do is we established</font>

1020
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:23,410
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scheduled tasks</font>

1021
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:26,500
and just set up like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a basically an</font>

1022
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:28,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">interpreter reverse shell to run was it</font>

1023
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,800
like eight times a day across three

1024
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,960
different domain controller

1025
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,270
so we just got<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me shells and you</font>

1026
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,730
know which is an awful thing to do don't

1027
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:38,670
do it but at that same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time it does like</font>

1028
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,750
tests to see if they're looking for

1029
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:43,210
anything that's actually aggressive

1030
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:46,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">leaving leading the network typically on</font>

1031
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,400
servers you would schedule tasks much

1032
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,650
much less you know you might scheduled

1033
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,510
task every every few days something that

1034
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,370
effect if it's a workstation much more

1035
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,440
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you know</font>

1036
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,850
workstation traffic is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1037
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,100
frequent<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially making outbound</font>

1038
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:02,830
outbound connections you know else work

1039
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:05,319
so they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily looking at</font>

1040
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:06,850
work state workstation outbound egress

1041
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,900
traffic as much as they would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

1042
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:12,910
server so yeah at that point we have

1043
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,380
persistence and that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

1044
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:18,399
patience is a virtue because we're just

1045
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to sit on these the next the next</font>

1046
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,150
slide is basically chaining the chain of

1047
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,790
the chain composite<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks so this is</font>

1048
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:26,770
basically taking our initial point to

1049
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:29,650
establishing our persistence outbound

1050
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:33,310
through a critical system and now we're

1051
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:36,940
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take it to take it to kind of</font>

1052
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:39,160
the final stage where we need to

1053
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,070
identify individuals that are critical

1054
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,830
we need to understand folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are may</font>

1055
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:47,440
be associated with physical building

1056
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:50,620
physical security we need to understand

1057
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,120
folks that have access to you know in

1058
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">this particular instance it's it's a</font>

1059
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,330
financial organization right we need to

1060
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,580
understand how do they move how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1061
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:58,930
do a CH transactions etc out of the

1062
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,610
organization so we need to figure out

1063
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,990
those critical those critical

1064
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,640
individuals we don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font>

1065
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,979
about all of the the ancillary risk

1066
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,569
associated with other things they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1067
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,670
the environment we only care about those

1068
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:11,980
specific items so we patch up the

1069
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:15,370
network share login script and that way

1070
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:17,890
when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> login they're using a amounted</font>

1071
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:21,370
login script so when they log in it it

1072
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:22,750
drops a flat file and it's in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives</font>

1073
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,670
the actual physical machine we have

1074
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:26,170
access to the network share so we can

1075
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:27,940
pick up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual physical machine we</font>

1076
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:30,100
know there we know they're using in

1077
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,240
their accounting now we can redirect<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1078
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,368
of our activity are

1079
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,109
tension towards those those critical

1080
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:36,910
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> right those systems that you</font>

1081
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,740
know if we need further building access

1082
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:40,180
say for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance it's an entire campus</font>

1083
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,149
environment but we only have access to

1084
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,710
one building now we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> target those</font>

1085
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:48,790
those particular folks that do bats

1086
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:51,460
procurement that sort of thing so we do

1087
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:54,070
that we locate building facilities we

1088
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,230
locate these are systems of great

1089
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:58,240
importance pretty much and now at this

1090
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:01,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">point if we've identified all of those</font>

1091
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,279
we've obtained really people that know

1092
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:05,680
about ACH transfers we know people that

1093
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,720
have this tribal knowledge within the

1094
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,339
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know we only have</font>

1095
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,520
a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a few weeks maybe a</font>

1096
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:14,530
month etc to understand so we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1097
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,570
of fall at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point we stay quiet we</font>

1098
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:18,040
go dormant and we research absolutely

1099
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:20,650
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can and that's that's</font>

1100
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,880
kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical it takes the longest</font>

1101
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,960
part of the engage yeah that's

1102
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,850
nationally just trying to find the

1103
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,710
needle<font color="#CCCCCC"> days yeah that's not sexy but I</font>

1104
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:29,049
mean that is like fundamentally what I

1105
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:30,850
think overall assessing is it's

1106
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,610
basically just research and reviewing

1107
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:35,259
and understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of kind of your</font>

1108
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:36,730
target<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand what you're going</font>

1109
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">after right and in this particular</font>

1110
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,720
instance what we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> after is an</font>

1111
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:42,580
infrastructure we want to know how those

1112
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,859
systems interact we want to know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1113
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:48,279
can export rate money out of the

1114
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:53,250
organization so with that we identify

1115
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:56,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mainframes that the mainframes that</font>

1116
00:44:53,250 --> 00:45:00,820
basically all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FDIC transactions go</font>

1117
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:03,210
through etc we identify the software

1118
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:08,980
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> interacts with those mainframes and</font>

1119
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:11,020
in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to really truly exfiltrate</font>

1120
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:13,540
that data that's that's the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

1121
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:15,970
we pause we stop and we get a hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1122
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,220
the project sponsor and we say hey we're

1123
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:21,459
on your mainframe we have access to your

1124
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:23,080
to your stuff right set up a shell

1125
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,359
account for us so that's what they do

1126
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,540
they set up a shell account they fund to

1127
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:29,460
that shell account and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it</font>

1128
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,680
at that point that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can move money</font>

1129
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:35,210
outside of their organization and that's

1130
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,890
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to show impact</font>

1131
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:41,190
yeah so that's that's kind of at that

1132
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:42,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's where that entire how</font>

1133
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:44,070
long would these last about two months

1134
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,040
yeah something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that so it's about</font>

1135
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:48,510
two months worth of work to perform this

1136
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,840
this sort of attack but it demonstrates

1137
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:54,210
that your typical penetration test or

1138
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,820
typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> traditional test isn't going to</font>

1139
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:59,550
necessarily identify that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequence of</font>

1140
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:01,290
events that's going to lead up to such a

1141
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,000
great impact right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff</font>

1142
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:05,310
that's actually going to kill business

1143
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,530
you know that you disclose your<font color="#E5E5E5"> account</font>

1144
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:09,930
your financial data you you believe

1145
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:12,360
money out of your organization don't

1146
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:14,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">detect that that's that's you know</font>

1147
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:18,570
that's detrimental to to an organization

1148
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:22,110
so at that point i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you know</font>

1149
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:25,020
we we kind of talked to talk to the

1150
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:27,510
project sponsor and you know overall the

1151
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:28,800
outcome is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we want to protect want</font>

1152
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:30,590
to help organization protect those

1153
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,320
critical assets those critical processes

1154
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:35,730
and prevent that from happening all the

1155
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,230
rest of the ancillary vulnerabilities

1156
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:40,350
than the other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't</font>

1157
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:41,820
necessarily we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily concern</font>

1158
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:44,400
ourselves during a breach assessment or

1159
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:46,410
each simulation that maybe occurred

1160
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">variant penetration test those are kind</font>

1161
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:50,970

1168
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:12,149
incident response was inadequate they

1169
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:15,480
did detect our presence on the network

1170
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:17,730
at one point we<font color="#CCCCCC"> as when we're physically</font>

1171
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,050
on site we plug the laptop into their

1172
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,850
network this was after we stole the

1173
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:24,120
badge went<font color="#E5E5E5"> back on site at like 2am</font>

1174
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:25,529
plugged a laptop in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reineke port scans</font>

1175
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,810
to seal it you know what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1176
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,530
whatever they detected the laptop you

1177
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,090
know it was an

1181
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:39,720
team who lived 45 minutes away so you

1182
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:41,459
know why why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> they dispatch someone</font>

1183
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,770
who lives 45 minutes away why would they

1184
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,390
dispatch an infosec person when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1185
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:47,820
probably should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be someone trained to</font>

deal with a hostile you know individual

00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:52,970
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending on who it is so</font>

1188
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:56,520
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test</font>

1189
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:58,230
that's a process thing yep in effective

1190
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">v breast controls why are your critical</font>

1191
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:01,800

controllers you got databases why are

00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,150
they allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk on there's no</font>

1194
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:09,390
reason for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so yeah that was that</font>

1195
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:11,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">was interesting password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were used</font>

1196
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:13,410

00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:16,669
identity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> access management there was</font>

1198
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:19,589
no you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there really wasn't no</font>

1199
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:22,500
protection prevention from from someone

1200
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:25,050
establishing a lower lower privileged

outlook web access and on applications

1205
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:42,240
again these you know would complain the

1206
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:45,450
first things that we do is we try to

1207
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,459
compromise the actual email systems

1208
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">right because email systems are critical</font>

1209
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,300
intelligence<font color="#E5E5E5"> is critical surveillance on</font>

1210
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,710
what we're going through you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1211
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,970
we're kind of moving throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1212
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:56,430
entire attack sequence we want to

1213
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:58,109
understand what they've detected we want

1214
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:00,180
to understand if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've dispatched</font>

1215
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:02,550
something to like mitigate our attack

1216
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:05,580
whatsoever to maybe block us to notify

1217
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:07,620
whatever we don't care will hack the

1218
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:10,110
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the instant messaging</font>

1219
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:12,060
systems will hack the email if you

1220
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect it with a simple user name and</font>

1221
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,509
password we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the password</font>

1222
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,130
work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we're going to basically just</font>

1223
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:18,390
squat on<font color="#E5E5E5"> those systems and intercept</font>

1224
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,990
traffic we're going to identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1225
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:23,609
again that's the real reason why we

1226
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:25,319
target building physical security

1227
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:26,970
because we want to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

1228
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,290
the reason why we target infosec folks

1229
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:29,580
because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what</font>

1230
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:31,860
they're doing is the reason why we

1231
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,279
target information technology groups

1232
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,750
because

1233
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,480
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well as all the rest</font>

1234
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:40,260
of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks that have the again</font>

1235
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,720
that intrinsic knowledge guard stations

1236
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical badge on security so these guys</font>

1237
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,140
leave at a certain time of<font color="#E5E5E5"> night and</font>

1238
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:48,480
they just leave it all you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of</font>

1239
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,770
cleaned US policy some of these guys

1240
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,210
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe in that so they just leave</font>

1241
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:52,620
everything just kind of kind of laying

1242
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:54,600
out or they'll take all the badges and

1243
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:56,160
they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> throw them in a drawer and then</font>

1244
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,080
well they<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> walk right they'll just</font>

1245
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,950
leave them or they'll just to put them

1246
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:04,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">in some kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of minimal security</font>

1247
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:05,730
enclosure right that we can get to quite

1248
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,080
easily right and it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of out</font>

1249
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:10,890
there and open yeah what he didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

1250
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:12,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">is we also stole let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 vendor badges</font>

1251
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:17,370
straight out of the security guard desk

1252
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:18,480
get one tonight yeah so and then you

1253
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we have that adequate social</font>

1254
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,680
engineering challenge and we have weak

1255
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,299
password policies so these are the

1256
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,980
adequate social engineering challenge

1257
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,440
thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hard protect</font>

1258
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,790
against right there's a heart it's it's

1259
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to meditate that but the weak</font>

1260
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:34,170
password policy if you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> weak</font>

1261
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,480
passwords that's that's kind of first

1262
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:38,460
defense right you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to employ</font>

1263
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,460
something that's complex and preferably

1264
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:42,390
some kind of multi-factor authentication

1265
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:46,710
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out of time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to endless</font>

1266
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:50,460
bass track go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 here it comes time</font>

1267
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:51,930
again yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just do three but if</font>

1268
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,660
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open up oh yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's good</font>

1269
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:56,759
okay so yeah so we'll jump into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1270
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,350
case so similar along the same lines was

1271
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,840
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of run through the whole attack</font>

1272
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:04,589
scenario so this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a large insurance</font>

1273
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:07,020
company again they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had very good</font>

1274
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:08,880
existing security policies including you

1275
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:12,089
know authenticated outbound proxy

1276
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,710
network segmentation

1277
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:15,940
most of this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty standard but they</font>

1278
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:17,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have really good egress</font>

1279
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,210
controls were like none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their servers</font>

1280
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:21,309
were allowed to talk outbound so they

1281
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:25,049
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually doing that right and they</font>

1282
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:27,789
also had a very good physical security

1283
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:30,849
we'll get into some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but they</font>

1284
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:34,210
have turnstiles pretty much every point

1285
00:51:30,849 --> 00:51:37,390
of egress point in the building<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

1286
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:39,910
getting up in and out of elevators I

1287
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:42,069
mean every floor had turnstile so if you

1288
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:44,319
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a badge then you probably</font>

1289
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:49,329
weren't going to be able to tailgate in

1290
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:50,259
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything like that let's see so we</font>

1291
00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:53,799
kind of knew about their physical

1292
00:51:50,259 --> 00:51:55,509
security before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we set foot on site so</font>

1293
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:57,160
while we were doing some of the the

1294
00:51:55,509 --> 00:51:58,509
remote testing you know the question

1295
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,970
kind of loomed<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we were kind of</font>

1296
00:51:58,509 --> 00:52:02,259
planning our<font color="#E5E5E5"> on-site portion of it you</font>

1297
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:05,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how are we actually going to get in</font>

1298
00:52:02,259 --> 00:52:07,390
physically you know when we do these

1299
00:52:05,049 --> 00:52:09,729
engagements there's almost always an

1300
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:12,009
on-site and remote component right and

1301
00:52:09,729 --> 00:52:13,180
so to fully test an organization we feel

1302
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:15,309
like we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have like a legitimate</font>

1303
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:16,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">attack vector in both so you know that</font>

1304
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:17,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">was kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the question when we go on</font>

1305
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:21,968
<font color="#E5E5E5">site are we even going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do</font>

1306
00:52:17,739 --> 00:52:23,410
anything so we weren't sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font>

1307
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:26,829
actually attempted three different

1308
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:31,538
spearfishing campaigns initially so it

1309
00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:34,900
netted us two sets of domain creds but

1310
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:37,539
they detected us fairly quickly with the

1311
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:39,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">domain creds we got access to Citrix</font>

1312
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:42,130
environment externally<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was using</font>

1313
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:43,629
factor off but they detected it quickly

1314
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:45,220
they killed our sessions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font>

1315
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:47,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">force the people to change the passwords</font>

1316
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:50,589
but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually told us is it</font>

1317
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">disclosed their password policy it was</font>

1318
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:54,970
weak it was like you know six characters

1319
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:59,259
something like that so what we were able

1320
00:52:54,970 --> 00:53:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is kind of take that idea and to a</font>

1321
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:03,700
password guessing attack against one of

1322
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:05,410
their authentication portals based on

1323
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,660
like a you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six character password</font>

1324
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:10,990
policy and so what this did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1325
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:13,720
this was we use you know common you know

1326
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:15,609
common pattern is to use like you know

1327
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,549
the month followed by a year so if this

1328
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:20,140
in this case it was like jam 2015 I

1329
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:23,230
think we chose and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ran it across</font>

1330
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:24,970
a number of different users it also

1331
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:26,440
disclosed their their user account

1332
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:28,509
aiming system so they didn't use like

1333
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:33,040
first initial last name they use like a

1334
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:35,230
predictable type semi predictable you

1335
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,730
know alphanumeric template yeah it was

1336
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:38,560
kind of alphanumeric it was incremental

1337
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:40,869
you know so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could kind of iterate</font>

1338
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:43,029
through them and try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess so you</font>

1339
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:45,550
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ran a password guessing</font>

1340
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:49,330
campaign using that password in it got

1341
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:51,970
us I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 10 different hits so</font>

1342
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:53,350
we were back in in this time since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1343
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:55,600
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a spear fish attack</font>

1344
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:59,799
they didn't detect us so we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

1345
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:03,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">to citrix we broke out citrix and you</font>

1346
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:07,210
know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there we we noted that one of</font>

1347
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:08,800
the credentials that we had pulled one

1348
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:11,050
of the groups that have belonged to in

1349
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,030
Active Directory it was listed as like

1350
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:14,800
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine name underscore admin was</font>

1351
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:18,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> group's or like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an admin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that</font>

1352
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,109
box so we authenticate as that user to

1353
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:22,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> box and sure enough he was local</font>

1354
00:54:20,109 --> 00:54:24,910
admin so you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get system we</font>

1355
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:27,490
dumped the hashes he's using<font color="#CCCCCC"> mini cats</font>

1356
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:30,310
if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> used that so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dumped the</font>

1357
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:35,290
creds and on there was domain admin so

1358
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:41,049
just like that we have a domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> app yeah</font>

1359
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:45,430
so next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but like I said they</font>

1360
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:47,260
had a really good egress controls so we

1361
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:47,690
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pretty much tell all our traffic</font>

1362
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:52,369
through

1363
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:54,170
Citrix box expanding the network

1364
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:55,490
presence was a little bit challenging

1365
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:56,990
for that reason so we couldn't really

1366
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:59,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">bounce around like we normally could</font>

1367
00:54:56,990 --> 00:55:01,819
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't establish</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remote the</font>

1368
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:03,890
you know reverse connections but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

1369
00:55:01,819 --> 00:55:07,880
were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you know through that</font>

1370
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:10,310
access we were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually browse</font>

1371
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,050
network shares as domain admin we

1372
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,400
bounced around and expanded our

1373
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:15,260
presidents pulled other domain and

1374
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,060
domain admin passwords and things like

1375
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,730
that just so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you know a better</font>

1376
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:21,380
foothold on the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we did</font>

1377
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:22,550
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shares and this</font>

1378
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:25,220
is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> common you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we just looked</font>

1379
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:27,140
at an HR<font color="#E5E5E5"> Payroll network share and we</font>

1380
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:29,779
pulled files that had all their

1381
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,970
employees you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know pay information</font>

1382
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:36,619
social security numbers since like

1383
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:38,689
pulled customer details so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1384
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:40,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">really know most of it meant quite</font>

1385
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:44,900
honestly because it was insurance and

1386
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:48,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's insurance but you know it looked</font>

1387
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:51,319
like it was in the sensitive nature and

1388
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:53,510
so most importantly we spent a good deal

1389
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:56,470
of our time actually focusing on recon

1390
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:59,960
so we started targeting the actual

1391
00:55:56,470 --> 00:56:02,750
facilities folks from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network shares</font>

1392
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:05,569
we identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name of their badge</font>

1393
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:08,359
provisioning software as well as their

1394
00:56:05,569 --> 00:56:10,250
security camera software we got access

1395
00:56:08,359 --> 00:56:12,440
to their security cameras remotely so

1396
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:14,420
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we knew about their physical</font>

1397
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,280
security presence before we set foot on

1398
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:17,750
site so we're looking at cameras<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1399
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,819
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> lobby more knowing all the turn</font>

1400
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:22,250
styles everywhere we noted that they had

1401
00:56:19,819 --> 00:56:23,599
a 24-hour guard presence right so we

1402
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:25,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">were going to get in after hours and</font>

1403
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,510
walk right past the guard desk there was

1404
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:28,790
nobody there but the guard

1405
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:30,260
like we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see by it so that's</font>

1406
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:31,430
that's how we kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wondered so we</font>

1407
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:34,640
spent a good deal of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1408
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:36,919
focusing specifically on weaknesses or

1409
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">gourd you know how we could we could</font>

1410
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,360
actually provision<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own badge so one</font>

1411
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:43,160
of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we ended up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

1412
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:45,260
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about gaining</font>

1413
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,330
access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> webmail right once we</font>

1414
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:50,060
identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there was a physical</font>

1415
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:53,960
security person and we understood which

1416
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:56,360
system that that he lived on also gained

1417
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:58,130
access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web mail and then spent a</font>

1418
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:00,470
good amount of time rifling through and

1419
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:04,520
just reading absolutely everything doing

1420
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:06,319
targeted searches so we knew that we

1421
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,490
knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did bad provisioning but</font>

1422
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,650
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to understand specifically</font>

1423
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,870
what that meant so we've got the reader

1424
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:14,930
types we got the badge types we got the

1425
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:17,240
provisioning details for the badge we

1426
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:19,940
knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had a certain facility ID</font>

1427
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:22,970
code associated with the badge we knew

1428
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:26,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they paid extra money to hit to to</font>

1429
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:29,839
get Christian keys we had a wealth of

1430
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:31,820
knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can leverage kind of</font>

1431
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:33,530
going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this and we didn't</font>

1432
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:35,810
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the equipment to create</font>

1433
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:37,460
our own badge for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the specific type they</font>

1434
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:39,320
were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're kind of screwed in</font>

1435
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:41,510
that nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're kind of you know</font>

1436
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:44,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dan you can't create our own so you know</font>

1437
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:46,760
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative so we actually we</font>

1438
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:48,710
gained access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the badging software</font>

1439
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:52,070
remotely before we set foot on site as

1440
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:54,290
as like their facilities manager the

1441
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:56,690
problem is once we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually got on sites</font>

1442
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:58,070
our plan was you know we have access to

1443
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,600
this badging software what we'll do is

1444
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:01,460
we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> an existing card that we have</font>

1445
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,040
that was kind of the same type we'll go

1446
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:05,600
scan it or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just capture it</font>

1447
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,060
in the system we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go look at the logs</font>

1448
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,710
in the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then basically add</font>

1449
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:13,009
it as an authorized cart<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was kind</font>

1450
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:14,570
of kind of our level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thinking there</font>

1451
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,950
were some limitations to that where we

1452
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:17,900
wouldn't be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1453
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:19,189
the floors that we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to because you</font>

1454
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,710
know you could only add a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

1455
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:22,900
of card types for floor so we didn't

1456
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:26,589
know if that was the route

1457
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:27,970
to go so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> access we went on site</font>

1458
00:58:26,589 --> 00:58:29,980
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> leg art well at least we have</font>

1459
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:32,020
kind of a foothold we have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of</font>

1460
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:33,520
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can do the problem is</font>

1461
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:36,520
when we got on site we no longer had

1462
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,440
access to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this user's account this</font>

1463
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,150
the facilities manager he changed his

1464
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,039
password there were a couple of

1465
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:43,599
incidental things that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could no</font>

1466
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:47,349
longer get his password through the same

1467
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:50,230
means that that we had so we went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1468
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:53,410
domain controller and we performed a

1469
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:56,529
shadow copy of the NTDs did file tried

1470
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:58,029
to extract it problem is extracting it

1471
00:58:56,529 --> 00:59:01,599
while tunneling everything through the

1472
00:58:58,029 --> 00:59:03,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Citrix server was incredibly slow it</font>

1473
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,849
failed multiple times so I mean we were

1474
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:09,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know out of luck doing that</font>

1475
00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:11,049
remotely now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a different</font>

1476
00:59:09,069 --> 00:59:13,200
weakness that normally you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

1477
00:59:11,049 --> 00:59:16,359
think is necessarily a big deal but

1478
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,279
their wireless signal bleed was

1479
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:20,170
incredible<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I'm we're talking like</font>

1480
00:59:18,279 --> 00:59:22,210
two blocks away from the facility you

1481
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:24,369
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> full wireless strength to their</font>

1482
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:26,950
their corporate network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we went sat</font>

1483
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:29,410
at a starbucks one night and downloaded

1484
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:31,299
the file in 10 minutes time you know

1485
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:33,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">like as Starbucks was closed and we</font>

1486
00:59:31,299 --> 00:59:35,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">downloaded the file then you know we</font>

1487
00:59:33,309 --> 00:59:37,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">used the entity is that hit file crack</font>

1488
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:39,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">the passwords got the guys pass we're</font>

1489
00:59:37,299 --> 00:59:41,859
back got access back to the badging

1490
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:43,450
software so again you know we we

1491
00:59:41,859 --> 00:59:44,740
exploited like the wireless signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> eat</font>

1492
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:48,240
something you wouldn't normally consider

1493
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:52,299
as a big deal to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain access</font>

1494
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:53,740
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were doing info while we</font>

1495
00:59:52,299 --> 00:59:56,259
were digging around<font color="#E5E5E5"> their network shares</font>

1496
00:59:53,740 --> 01:00:00,308
and and their<font color="#E5E5E5"> email we actually found</font>

1497
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:03,730
documents about their processes for

1498
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:06,549
issuing badges to employees who had like

1499
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:08,589
left of my own and the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

1500
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:10,538
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so they required like three</font>

1501
01:00:08,589 --> 01:00:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">pieces of information so you know</font>

1502
01:00:10,539 --> 01:00:14,440
employee shows up two words i love<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1503
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:18,069
badge<font color="#CCCCCC"> anam nice Union temporary badge so</font>

1504
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:22,210
they required the employees name their

1505
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:25,810
network ID and also

1506
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:28,869
there they validated a picture in the

1507
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:30,759
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we had access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to they</font>

1508
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:32,859
validated that picture against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1509
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">person standing in front of them and so</font>

1510
01:00:32,859 --> 01:00:36,640
yeah you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go with this so</font>

1511
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,530
what we did two<font color="#E5E5E5"> o'clock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the morning</font>

1512
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:44,440
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> him is fantastic he looks like</font>

1513
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:46,089
help like a wish cosmic yeah and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1514
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">out drinking before that so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1515
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:49,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">two more than that was a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to</font>

1516
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:51,460
take this picture oh yeah you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1517

1518
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:55,570
of work there yeah so we take this

1519
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,970
picture and we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out</font>

1520
01:00:55,570 --> 01:01:00,609
where they store all all the employee

1521
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:01,959
photos and we just randomly picked out

1522
01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:04,540
an employee and like our you're going to

1523
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:06,849
be this guy for the day we put his photo

1524
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:09,040
in there validated that it was his

1525
01:01:06,849 --> 01:01:11,109
picture when he pulled<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and we're like</font>

1526
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,480
okay yeah so you're just gonna walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1527
01:01:11,109 --> 01:01:14,619
tell the guard your this guy and you

1528
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,720
know see if they'll issue you a

1529
01:01:14,619 --> 01:01:18,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">temporary badge once he gets a temporary</font>

1530
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,140
working badge I mean it's game over we

1531
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,520
have access to the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can</font>

1532
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:25,180
grant it<font color="#CCCCCC"> God rights to the entire</font>

1533
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:27,040
building and stuff right so just you

1534
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:29,348
know to make it more fun i sat<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

1535
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:31,330
starbucks next door because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1536
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:32,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless signal bleep oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so part</font>

1537
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:33,940
of the process that's been the issue

1538
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,740
well let's talk about like the reason

1539
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,750
why we had to give a bad real quick so

1540
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,700
the badge the facility code on the magic

1541
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:41,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">of its proprietary we couldn't recreate</font>

1542
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:44,200
the actual I class badges that they were

1543
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:45,940
using and the actual readers that they

1544
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,560
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> using would only allow and because</font>

1545
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:50,230
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a multi-tenant building they</font>

1546
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:52,779
could provision up to eight separate our

1547
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:54,520
individual facility ID codes and then

1548
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:56,020
after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can provision anything</font>

1549
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,609
else so you actually had to have like

1550
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:59,890
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their ballot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matches or Chloe</font>

1551
01:01:57,609 --> 01:02:02,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">ballot badge with about a facility code</font>

1552
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:03,970
now because they were all maxed out if

1553
01:02:02,349 --> 01:02:05,500
we drop one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the facility codes</font>

1554
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,848
associated with an individual reader

1555
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,619
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're performing the</font>

1556
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:09,870
denial service essentially on the tenant

1557
01:02:08,619 --> 01:02:11,610
no one's going to be able to get into

1558
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:14,100
into the building via that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1559
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:15,600
definitely going to set off a lot yeah

1560
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:17,970
so that's the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we needed an</font>

1561
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:21,390
actual badge we needed an actual I class

1562
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:23,129
batch with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> facility code and also we</font>

1563
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:25,140
noted from the documents that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1564
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:27,150
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at for provisioning that part of</font>

1565
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,980
the processes when when an employee's

1566
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:31,110
issued a temporary that they disabled

1567
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:33,990
the employees previous batch right and

1568
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:35,760
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> his badge won't work until he returns</font>

1569
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:37,259
the temporary badge then they ran able

1570
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,940
to write it's just so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he only has</font>

1571
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,950
one working that at any<font color="#CCCCCC"> given time and</font>

1572
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">they also had a note in there saying</font>

1573
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:44,250
that this employee was issued this

1574
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:47,520
temporary badge well<font color="#E5E5E5"> although so anyway</font>

1575
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:49,560
he walks him into up to the garden and

1576
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,880
tells him that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> he left his</font>

1577
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,140
badge at home and would make sure that

1578
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,000
we did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing in the morning</font>

1579
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,670
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the employee got got in you know</font>

1580
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,110
we didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to raise any alarms or</font>

1581
01:02:56,670 --> 01:03:00,360
whatever this employees in the building

1582
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:01,470
trying to swipe and he just can't get

1583
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,170
anywhere you know because it's

1584
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:05,879
temporarily disabled so first thing in

1585
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:08,430
the morning 730 or whatever he walks in

1586
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,500
goes and explains to the guard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he</font>

1587
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:12,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">left his badge at home sure enough you</font>

1588
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:17,310
know he gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> he gives a fake name and</font>

1589
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:19,560
the the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LAN ID account that we knew</font>

1590
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:21,900
and then they validate the picture again

1591
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:25,740
picture that he looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hell in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

1592
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:27,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if I yeah so before so this is kind</font>

1593
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:29,729
of a social engineering aspect of it

1594
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:31,230
right so when I when we took the picture

1595
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:34,020
i look like hell<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've got a full beard</font>

1596
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:36,150
right I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 2am bags under your</font>

1597

1598
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:42,040
days<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so so then when I walk in I'm</font>

1599
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,690
you know dressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1600

1601
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:47,080
clean shaven it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gives the</font>

1602
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:49,570
impression that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time has</font>

1603
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:51,220
elapsed right so that was back when you

1604
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:53,290
know fact when I first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started rears</font>

back when i was at<font color="#CCCCCC"> boeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i got my first</font>

1606
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:59,140

company so it was it was very<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

1610
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:08,229
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good believable so he gets issued a</font>

1611
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:10,420
temporary<font color="#E5E5E5"> badge just it worked out</font>

1612
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:12,790
flawless like right so he's in there for

1613

1615
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:18,640
building he comes over to starbucks

<font color="#E5E5E5">the bad jury enabled and then he's like</font>

1623
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:34,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">our long ago test it out so well Irene</font>

1624
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:37,330
able the other guys badge you know

1625
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:39,430
remove all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> history the note that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

1626
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:42,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">added in there so there's really no</font>

1627
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:43,600
record that the second batch was

1628
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:45,430
actually issued to this guy you know he

1629
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,470
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> walks into the building and you</font>

1630
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:49,450
know authenticates to the turnstile hops

1631
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:52,209
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> elevator goes up with 20 context</font>

1632
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:54,520
you know floor and walks around<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

1633
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:56,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">know at that point it was a weakness in</font>

1634
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:59,230
their process<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like how do you</font>

1635
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,640
validate an employer left his wallet at

1636
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:02,620
home you know you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you</font>

1637
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,180
government ID because he left his wallet

1638
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:07,720
well they need to think of a different

1639
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:10,060
you know validation means you know

1640
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:12,240
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to look at you come down</font>

1641
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:16,990
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> escort you or something like that so</font>

1642
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:19,560
and the more the story is it's that as

1643
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:19,560
it's just that

1644
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:29,890
oh yeah so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is yeah just kind of the</font>

1645
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:31,960
review you know some of the findings

1646
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:33,730
that we have we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out of time</font>

1647
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:35,710
so we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> go over these but you know we</font>

1648
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:37,390
talked about these and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1649
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:39,640
repeats from the other scenario we

1650
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:42,040
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you'll see common</font>

1651
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,810
threads are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> factor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off we</font>

1652
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,910
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's one of the most standing</font>

1653
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:47,950
issue so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of leads to the next</font>

1654
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:49,330
slide I think yeah we can't compile the

1655
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:52,480
list of you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

1656
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:54,910
most serious flaws that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1657
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,170
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can fix one thing in</font>

1658
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:59,440
your organization if you could dedicate

1659
01:05:56,170 --> 01:06:01,750
you know money to like one thing well we

1660
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,910
would probably i would probably push for

1661
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:08,020
two factor authentication like

1662
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:10,350
everywhere nothing realistically I

1663
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:12,850
happen but you know what I'm saying

1664
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:15,190
improper egress controls on servers

1665
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:16,900
outbound those two things alone I think

1666
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:21,370
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> make our jobs a hell a lot harder</font>

1667
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:22,900
and you know in spending money<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1668
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:24,700
times for organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you don't</font>

1669
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:26,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unlimited amounts of money right so</font>

1670
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:28,210
you just try to spend enough money<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1671
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:30,790
you can delay an attack or long enough

1672
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:32,350
that you can detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you right that's</font>

1673
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:41,590
kind of the goal that's the work that

1674
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:42,640
that should be a realistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal so yeah</font>

1675
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:43,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">so reasons for a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

1676
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,890
vulnerabilities will just shoot through

1677
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:46,540
these real quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> mergers and</font>

1678
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:50,020
acquisitions people people lose track of

1679
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:52,890
their with a trap what the question what

1680
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:55,120
they truly have in their environment so

1681
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:57,100
through through merger and acquisition

1682
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,330
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> obtain a whole lot of different</font>

1683
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:00,339
assets different resources and they

1684
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:03,009
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good inventory right so it</font>

1685
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:04,270
introduces vulnerabilities in effect of

1686
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:05,680
asset management they just don't know

1687
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:08,140
what they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't</font>

1688
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,970
perform asset management or asset

1689
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:12,490
inventory throughout the entire

1690
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:14,350
organization they have they have

1691
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:15,729
outliers they you know don't know that

1692
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:17,380
they have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers that are</font>

1693
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:18,700
controlling<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sprinkler system elsewhere</font>

1694
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:20,500
that's actually still connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1695
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:24,569
network ok it's just introduced a

1696
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:26,340
vulnerability employee turnover that can

1697
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:29,220
what happened you don't maintain that

1698
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:31,110
continuity when you have a dedicated

1699
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,609
employee and that employee leaves and

1700
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:35,040
you have turnover we kind of lose that

1701
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:39,390
tribal knowledge that then but once once

1702
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:42,300
had right disparate change management

1703
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:44,100
processes so you might have good change

1704
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,810
management<font color="#CCCCCC"> new window systems but you</font>

1705
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to change management on your</font>

1706
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:50,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're Nick's environment you don't have</font>

1707
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,700
a good change management on your network

1708
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:55,440
elements your switches your router's

1709
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:57,000
your DLP devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1710
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have all of these</font>

1711

these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of answer devices out there</font>

1712
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:06,090
what Dan was just talking about

1713
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:09,360
inadequate budget so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

1714
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:11,130
the budget you might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the sea</font>

1715
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,630
level support you might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

1716
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:15,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">support from board of directors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1717
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:20,069
allocate funds associated with upgrading

1718
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:21,570
security that's a that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another thing</font>

1719
01:08:20,069 --> 01:08:23,429
is just no<font color="#E5E5E5"> executive support you can't</font>

1720
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:25,830

mitigate risk and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have the</font>

1724
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:37,320
necessary means you're kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1725
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:40,380
look so lack of trained skilled<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec</font>

1726
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:43,620
pros we know that is definitely a

1727
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:47,400
problem in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry can't get enough</font>

skill skilled resources that not only

1729
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:51,750
are skilled can talk technical but can

1734
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:03,689
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem so I just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hope the lawyer lawyer up and get lots</font>

of errors and omissions insurance

1737
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:07,199
because that

1738
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:09,960
that's going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later on</font>

1739
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:15,358
down the road and I think one of the big

1740
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:17,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that can point to evangelize</font>

1741
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:20,130
really kind of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security vendor</font>

more funds leverage your security vendor

<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can get the necessary a lot of</font>

1751
01:09:41,009 --> 01:09:45,089
times we actually get requests I mean

1752
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,710
the issues that maybe we wouldn't call

1753
01:09:45,089 --> 01:09:49,109
out specifically or make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that big of a</font>

1754
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:50,609
deal the customers will ask us so can

01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:52,109
you highlight that we've been pushing

1756

for funding for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you highlight</font>

1757
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:58,860
it yeah yeah you know we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no problem</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing yeah it helps most bang for the</font>

01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:06,929
buck yep I didn't and this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1760
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,449
just reiterating that but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1761
01:10:06,929 --> 01:10:10,650
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the most critical things</font>

1762
01:10:09,449 --> 01:10:12,389
that you could probably put in your

1763
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:14,190
environment that I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1764
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:16,080
our job multi-factor<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication and</font>

01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:18,330
authentic and outbound proxies egress

01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,190
controls this is identifying your

1767
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:22,610
critical servers that shouldn't be

talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> bounce securing your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BIOS</font>

1769
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:27,599
not prevent devices from connecting to a

1770
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:30,060
lantern Wi-Fi that would prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> us from</font>

1771
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,650
actually gaining passwords and you know

1772
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,670
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to starbucks and authenticate you</font>

1773
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:35,159
and being able to compromise your

network monitoring alerting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and auditing</font>

1775
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:38,489
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> batch provisioning that's another big</font>

1776
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:40,919
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously because then at that</font>

1777
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:42,809
point when we deactivate an employee's

1778
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:45,150
badge re reactivate

1779
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:46,620
reprovision we change privilege levels

1780
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:48,269
associated with a badge all of those

1781
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:50,220
sorts of things should trigger events

1782
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:52,680
and there should be investigated and

1783
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:55,410
then critical file integrity checking or

1784
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:57,630
really some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your most important your</font>

most<font color="#E5E5E5"> important resources on zipper</font>

1786
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:01,230
instance servers and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1787
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:04,890
if you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got transaction</font>

1788
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:06,570
software that may be moved money into

1789
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:07,920
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe another batch process or</font>

1790
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:10,170
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you definitely want</font>

1791
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,430
to implement integrity monitoring

1792
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:13,170
because if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes in there to</font>

1793
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:15,090
change it changes the hatch the the

01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:16,440
overall signature of that file you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>
