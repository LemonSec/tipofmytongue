11
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,530

14
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,810

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,210
that it's a zero-day right I know thanks

16
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:22,149
so today we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> identify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font>

17
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,259
artifacts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> father's your catalog</font>

18
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:26,390
and how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use up for forensic</font>

19
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,280
analysis to actually see what files

20
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,869
we're on our system without doing a deep

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,929
dive onto the UFT file tables so file

22
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:38,420
history<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is it it is a backup</font>

23
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:41,119
solution that is integrated into windows

24
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,920
8 8.1 windows 10 and what i Lipo

25
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,159
anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> will this with its out in</font>

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,060
future it is off by default but it's

27
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">able per user by user it does automatic</font>

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,910
backups and it's very configurable you

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,099
can decide how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long you're going to</font>

30
00:01:52,910 --> 00:02:00,979
retain<font color="#CCCCCC"> the backups your along backed up</font>

31
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:03,020
for frequency that it backs up where it

32
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:05,569
backs up so when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

33
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,098
configure file history if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

34
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:09,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it initially this is what it looks</font>

35
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,239
like a promise ring off in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,180
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be back up to my removable disk</font>

37
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:21,680
drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> II that's the size i got to backup</font>

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:24,580
in windows 10 it's a little bit cleaner

39
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,250
and this is on again<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm back it up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

40
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,959

41
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,660
for difference between Windows 8 Windows

42
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,790
10 actually now in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows 10 i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can cook</font>

43
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,520
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and instead of having a set</font>

44
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,410
one so it allows me to if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i make sharing</font>

45
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,540
these tonight let's have it it backs up

46
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,079
every six hours if i need to do it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

47
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,079
can do that

when you look at the backup folder as

144
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,780
you see each<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of our directories has</font>

145
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,430
their own directors in there this is

146
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,710
while our files look like each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is</font>

147
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:38,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">appended with the UTC time a widow is</font>

148
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:40,510
backed up so our catalog which is very

149
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,550
important it contains every transaction

150
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,890
that it's done on its back up when it's

151
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,810
backed it up the strings the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file has</font>

152
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,490
this allows you to actually figure out

153
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,650
what was on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box let's now no longer</font>

154
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,320
on the box the<font color="#E5E5E5"> duration it was on the</font>

155
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,700
box or at least in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> location and I</font>

156
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:59,409
said this can be found in our catalog

157
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:02,860
one day two ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use either one where</font>

158
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:05,170
or an airsoft online the one where it

159
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,720
throws some errors using Windows 8

160
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,250
Windows 10 unless I do it from a thunder

161
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,310
and to do it from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thumb drive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

162
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:16,150
fine but I can export all my table

163
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,890
screen at once the nearest off never had

164
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,440
an issue with about any OS I've ran it

165
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,919
on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to export my tables</font>

166
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,920
individually

167
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,680
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

168
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:54,089
it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in my and the one where I</font>

169
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:58,500
can actually browse to my different

170
00:08:54,089 --> 00:09:00,600
tables and get my information at this

171
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,040
point it's very confusing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have two</font>

172
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:09,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">about back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forth they was to</font>

173
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:15,719
understand where youre looking at this

174
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:21,800
is what your Softsoap like yourself is

175
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:26,339
almost as convoluted and confusing but

176
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,628
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> told you it was backed up doing</font>

177
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,220
this research and looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you're</font>

178
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:31,949
bouncing back and forth between the

179
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,199
tables making notes it's fine if you

180
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:36,628
only have half a dozen entries but

181
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,959
consider it backs up everything in those

182
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:43,100
directories including the desktop I&I

183
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,099
very quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess unmanageable</font>

184
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:56,239
so our tables are the mice as objects

185
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:59,600
the backup set file global library

186
00:09:56,239 --> 00:10:01,550
namespace and strings strings is pretty

187
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,369
much the only one that is what it sounds

188
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,248
like it's the strings that the pop has

189
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:09,290
file names the my sis object is

190
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:11,389
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> our data schema there's very</font>

191
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:15,439
good information in there from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

193
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:20,748
allows you to back up a session number

194
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:22,670
time stamping so you get understand when

195
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:27,019
the time and when the back across that

196

where you're backing up to

<font color="#E5E5E5">Global tables quite a bit of information</font>

217
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:32,269
but it's there's one like four or five

218
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:34,889
feels that you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,949
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a new one it will be entered</font>

into here based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a string and</font>

223
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:46,769
everything else the child ID eid for the

00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:51,089
table when it was created is it still

225
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:54,509
visible if there's any number in there

226
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:57,179
besides the value of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and 47 that</font>

227
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:58,920
value is when was last seen in that path

228
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:01,079
so if they move it it'll change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new</font>

229
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,128
path which then for update to a new

230
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:06,359
entry so the namespace table it tracks

231
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:09,360
your information with age of the file

232
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,509
elaborate location I don't quit

235
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:19,529
this is important if you're doing some

00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:24,809
file analysis on a one was<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on my</font>

on your host machine when it was created

245
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:50,730
when it was modified the parent ID the

246
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:53,610
status of it when it was first there the

247
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:57,660
user journal entry that it was created

<font color="#E5E5E5">in or updated in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> string table was</font>

249
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:04,290
again it's the thought path directory

251
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,549
my analysis on this I look at the backup

252
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:15,059
set the namespace the strings in the

253
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:19,829
file so the old way before I started

254
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:22,429
doing some access or Excel yes was to

255
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:22,429
come in here

256
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:47,260
so right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our namespace the child</font>

257
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:52,990
ID of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 22 38 for the attribute so warm up</font>

258
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:54,250
or shot I da20 parent idea of 21 I would

259
00:13:52,990 --> 00:14:00,280
have to then come back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my name's</font>

260
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:02,440
liquor my strengths we'd have to come

261
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:06,839
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so file 20 was my desktop and</font>

262
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">I and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was in</font>

263
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:19,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">milex you p is user profile Peavy is a</font>

264
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,290
public profile so if you see those you

265
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,900
give you an idea where they're stored at

266
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,670
this it's very time consuming when we

267
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,860
are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> our research it so i said if</font>

268
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:32,040
you've got multiple ones you're tracking

269
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:38,460
notes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i went on ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and create a</font>

270
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:43,890
spreadsheet that will do all the

271
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:48,510
analysis force this is what it looks

272
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:50,970
like you start having to upload or

273
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:54,950
import the values<font color="#CCCCCC"> of each of the tables</font>

274
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,950
that you want to record

275
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:11,470
and then once they're all input you go

276
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:13,649
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the initial tap let's hope this</font>

277
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,649
works

278
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:37,819
so now we have our values we have my

279
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:41,390
file here which is found in this

280
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:44,780
location it was a user journal entry

288

00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,670
location so now we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quickly</font>

290
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,120
run through and see what follows we

291
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,990
still have<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the box where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was that</font>

292
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,660
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not it's still present</font>

293
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,620
without having to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font>

294
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:23,060
cross-references strings to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup</font>

295
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:26,410
sets to the namespace so it's much

296
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,410
quicker it's much easier

297
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:37,449
and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're done we actually have a</font>

298
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,399
lamp and it goes through into each

299
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:42,149
everything so you can save it off and

300
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,149
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the next one</font>

301
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:58,729
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

302
00:16:52,579 --> 00:17:00,799
so any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this aspect yes so</font>

303
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,540
the application this really here is a

304
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,220
boost someone's flash drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they've</font>

305
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:08,648
been back you up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you could go to this</font>

306
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:11,449
we easily pull out you could do that

307
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:13,369
you're law enforcement you grab a box

308
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:16,429
the guy says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

309
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:18,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">kiddie porn on here I've deleted it oh</font>

310
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:19,850
look at these thumb drives a look in

311
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,069
this kind of database I can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

312
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:24,559
your kiddie porn directories and these

313
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:26,928
are when you had it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on here or if you</font>

314
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,760
find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> collection of other thumb drives</font>

315
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:31,190
and you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a single laptop</font>

316
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,230
and you come across three different Bob

317
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,820
histories each for pointing back to a

318
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,440
different machine now you've got more

319
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,908
systems you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually look at it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

320
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,669
now you know where else he's had access

321
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:44,720
to what else he's backing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to you with</font>

322
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:47,179
this pulling back the window or the one

323
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,409
drive from Microsoft anything that has

324
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:51,980
on the cloud that he also has think

325
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:53,120
locally you not have a copy of so it

326
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,000
gives you a better idea what's they're

327
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,500
usually if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to know if they file</font>

328
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,179
has been on a system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's deleted you</font>

329
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:04,130
either drop it into in case ftk<font color="#CCCCCC"> ex ways</font>

330
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:07,429
and look to see if it's in deleted files

331
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,960
or you carve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft the user drill if</font>

332
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:14,389
it's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a location that's being backed</font>

333
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:16,970
up it will show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here if it was in the</font>

334
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:19,370
back up cycle so that way you don't have

335
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:25,750
to carve the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LMT you don't have to pull</font>

336
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:25,750
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> out this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is one Puckett ball yes sir</font>

337
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,879
um so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is can i lock this</font>

338
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,830
down using group policy unfortunately

339
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:40,480
it's either honor it's off by group

340
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:43,129
policy nope it's either honors off

341
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft is there's been talk that they</font>

342
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,180
may change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but their idea is they</font>

343
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,090
want to use their be able to quickly

344
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:52,490
back it up there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of risk right</font>

345
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:55,370
now with in the enterprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> at on the</font>

346
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:58,630
users to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enable it just because people</font>

347
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:01,820
are not backing up to secure locations

348
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:04,850
yes sir yes let's get another subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

349
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,320
security and you know I school features

350
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,030
next Microsoft<font color="#E5E5E5"> for offering it but do</font>

351
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,700
they offer any sort of encryption option

352
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,290
for it on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> level two if you are</font>

353
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,840
backing up to an encrypted drive it's

354
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,790
encrypted it's your responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

355
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,889
encryption so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was does</font>

356
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,629
Microsoft offer any encryption into it

357
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,220
it's like almost any other backup

358
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:29,680
software if anyone encryption you have

359
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:29,680
to add it yes sir

360
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:41,190
depends on where it's backed up and how

361
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:43,260
bad that question was if my<font color="#E5E5E5"> father or my</font>

362
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,680
machine is compromised by ransomware can

363
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:48,420
I use<font color="#CCCCCC"> this to back it up so because it</font>

364
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't worried it's being backed up to if</font>

365
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,130
the ransomware has already infected that

366
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:57,240
backup location<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're there's nothing</font>

367
00:19:53,130 --> 00:20:00,420
we can do if you back it up nightly to a

368
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,860
thumb drive and you just hit move that

369
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,800
thumb drive there's a chance you can

370
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,300
pull back windows they<font color="#E5E5E5"> does anybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

371
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,649
Windows 8 Windows 10 in the enterprise

372
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:14,070
or any familiar with it so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows</font>

373
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:17,280
8 they released three total three

374
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:20,100
different recovery options you have your

375
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:24,149
old standby of the restore point that we

376
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:29,370
all know and hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> um then they also</font>

377
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:31,140
offered a refresh in a reset so they

378
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,479
refresh there's two options with that

379
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,470
either the default system refresh or a

380
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:40,230
custom refresh the default<font color="#CCCCCC"> is everything</font>

381
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">that has been installed on the box</font>

382
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,520
that's from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft when you go to</font>

383
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,200
refresh it reports everything back or

384
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,320
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you bought from the microsoft</font>

385
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:53,190
store so your<font color="#CCCCCC"> office appliances are</font>

386
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:56,250
there but your custom so like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

387
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,080
redo my printed box my in case has to be

388
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,600
reinstalled all my malware tools have to

389
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,189
be reinstalled if I use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> option or I</font>

390
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,469
can do a custom option and that's where

391
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,240
I install my system get exactly how I

392
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,600
want it then I create a goal built

393
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,430
that's a my back my refresh so now if i

394
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,639
ever get hit with a virus<font color="#CCCCCC"> or my yearly</font>

395
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:21,270
clean up my stuff I just refresh<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

396
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,040
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some luck in ransom we're doing</font>

397
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:25,170
that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough to feel safe with</font>

398
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,850
for me if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bright somewhere</font>

399
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:30,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font>

400
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:31,668
why it's I'm not I'm not concerned about

401
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:35,270
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I keep my dad in like five</font>

402
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:40,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">different areas so it's paranoia they</font>

403
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:43,400
also offer a refresh recent the reset is

404
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:46,220
there re wipe and reinstall in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LS it</font>

405
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,620
either does the mark<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that's</font>

406
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,140
deleted and install a brand new OS or

407
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,809
it's doing a random wipe across the hard

408
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,160
drive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dennis all the OS so</font>

409
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:57,440
Microsoft's got some options<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

410
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,640
recovery but if you're using file

411
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,169
history you're backing up to a remote

412
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">location and then let's say you do a</font>

413
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:05,419
reset or a restore the restore you'll

414
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:09,530
actually keep your user created files so

415
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:12,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it only reset I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then link back</font>

416
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,789
to my power my file directory or file

417
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,219
history directory and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> restore</font>

418
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:18,860
everything from there so there's options

419
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,169
but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's now or how safe do you</font>

420
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,299
honestly feel I mean you've already got

421
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:26,360
in there once are you sure you've gotten

422
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:30,289
rid of it my my belief is if I've got

423
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:34,389
infected I'm pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> it away so any</font>

424
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:34,390
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions yes ma'am</font>

425
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:47,350
file history in Windows 8 is the new

426
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:49,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">version of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> free previous version they've</font>

427
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:58,360
kind of rolled it away it still runs on

428
00:22:49,750 --> 00:23:02,160
the same concept yeah but it's it is at

429
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,159
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time it's the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

430
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:11,519
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of my backup locations</font>

431
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:21,530
and as you can see we've got it will

432
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">upend it with the most recent time</font>

433
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:26,360
stamps I can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have multiple</font>

434
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:28,810
versions in there and this is stored

435
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,810
offline

436
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:38,110
and there is a way to sosa Microsoft

437
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,430
decided that if you have one drive you

438
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,530
can't back up to onedrive accusing the

439
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:45,280
polyester because they don't trust one

440
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:47,379
drive you also can't back up to a hard

441
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,730
drive on the local machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> again if your</font>

442
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,710
machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets compromised you want to be</font>

443
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,410
able to save it but actually if you map

444
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:54,340
those back as like a network share

445
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:55,990
Microsoft doesn't understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

446
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,360
you can back up to one derived and then

447
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:05,880
back it up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another we should know</font>

448
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:05,879
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> my money box any other questions</font>

449
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:12,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so let's do the dangerous and this</font>

450
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what i love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about five story so there</font>

451
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:18,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a configuration point of file history</font>

452
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,490
that once you know what you're looking

453
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:29,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">for it becomes very dangerous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

454
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:32,260
fun from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a red team aspect so in our</font>

455
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:38,229
configuration file the line that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like</font>

456
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:42,180
is this string right here that's when i

457
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:50,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the best hits on so we go to Google</font>

458
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:55,140
we type in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that string and actually got</font>

459
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:55,139
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda better but this used to be</font>

460
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:01,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I'd see on hollow so we have our</font>

461
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,640
unsecured<font color="#E5E5E5"> nass that they're backing up</font>

462
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:06,600
windows a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two or Windows 10 we're</font>

463
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,600
backing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up all the files too</font>

464
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:19,310
um there's our configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop so that</font>

465
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:21,430
I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see configuration actually see</font>

466
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,429
it

467
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,450
so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop</font>

468
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,470
and i feel i have the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick on Dan</font>

469
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,470
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked to Danny before</font>

470
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,549
there you go

471
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,639
there's dad's account

472
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,600
once they go get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

473
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:06,439
we're documents now

474
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:12,450
so it's kind of fun from user standpoint

475
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:16,770
but last year I presented this at is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

476
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:19,220
an ASIS in Atlanta and that's a big

477
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:21,930
physical and digital security conference

478
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,660
and I was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through my deck and I</font>

479
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:27,660
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at some my use cases my</font>

480
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,610
demos of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> my that cubby name looks</font>

481
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:32,880
familiar they were one of the vendors

482
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,590
downstairs one of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEOs who left</font>

483
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,950
like four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> previously at all of</font>

484
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,600
this data that have all of their data I

485
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,690
knew their financials for the last 15

486
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">years I knew all their HR I knew</font>

487
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:50,430
everything about this company because

488
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:52,860
they vowed again this goes back it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

489
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:55,470
a file history issue in itself it's an

490
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,840
end user issue it's a security rather

491
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,100
data once he left the network one set up

492
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,500
the company<font color="#CCCCCC"> she'd never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had the access</font>

493
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,139
to any way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was being backed up on</font>

494
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,840
his own home server on his home<font color="#E5E5E5"> boxes to</font>

495
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,170
a task based on time stamping everything

496
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,970
else recon he had it touched it in years

497
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:13,560
but that doesn't mean I didn't access it

498
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,170
doesn't mean somebody else didn't access

499
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,550
it so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and actually talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to at</font>

500
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:22,200
first it didn't believe me so they sent

501
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:24,389
somebody after my talk and I blacked out

502
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,740
all their data but the guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

503
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,690
name does look familiar so when he came

504
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">fi have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show the mark was after the</font>

505
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,580
talk so it's a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is this is a</font>

506
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,659
great tool but in an enterprise level if

507
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,820
you're not securing it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

508
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,140
locking it down you allow your users to

509
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,050
back up to a location you're not

510
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,930
controlling it's a very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance that</font>

511
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">this data is out when I first start</font>

512
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:49,080
doing this research about 18 months ago

513
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten pages on Google of this data</font>

514
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,629
and it was the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten pages it's gone</font>

515
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:58,620
down now I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see nearly as many I'm</font>

516
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:00,390
disappointed there's an ftp site that

517
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,010
actually will grab all this because they

518
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:06,090
see these as<font color="#CCCCCC"> ftps and you can search on</font>

519
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:11,400
this in I've seen fortune 10 data out

520
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:13,889
there because were put your date out to

521
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,720
our users we're not understanding what

522
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:19,590
we're given her permission to and we're

523
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,720
afraid to lock things down so from an

524
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,209
attacker standpoint now since I now know

525
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,560
how to deconstruct<font color="#CCCCCC"> the catalog I can get</font>

526
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,360
any data set up there I can know what

527
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,970
else he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to I can know if</font>

528
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,830
he's actually worth printing fish trying

529
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,630
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more information from and what</font>

530
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:38,280
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe on a computer that I may have</font>

531
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:39,750
interest in so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all fun it's all</font>

532
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,620
games though it's also very dangerous

533
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:45,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do so any questions on that</font>

534
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,949
aspect

535
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,830
all right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

536
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,379
I'm still click on this talk
