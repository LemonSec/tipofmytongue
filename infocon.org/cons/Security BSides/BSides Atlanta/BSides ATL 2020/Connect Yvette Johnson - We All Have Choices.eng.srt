quickly shift and do this all virtual

6

has been taxing and we've had some

7
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:25,119
choice words with each other but in the

8
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:28,630

Partner of passport security so we all

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:47,410
have choices what are our choices every

15
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:50,680
day we have choices when we want to wake

16
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:54,940
up what we're gonna eat who detects who

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:57,550
to call what email to answer very simple

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,608
choices every day and then we have life

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,980
of choices life choices are the biggest

20
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:05,680
and didn't excuse me most difficult to

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,280
make and they likely change our lives

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,930
forever

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,939
and sometimes choices are made that

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,180
choices are made for you and they impact

25
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:20,139
your life and change your life forever

26
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:23,740
the phrase we all have choices was said

27
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:28,030
to me very early in my Information

28
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:32,048
Security career by a director that I

29
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:34,869
worked with when I was at the airline so

30
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:38,650
I will actually excuse me so sorry I

31
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:41,650
will actually get to all of that next so

32
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,930
it was I'm sure everybody is familiar

33
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,990
with what we call hacker summer camp

34
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:51,430
right it's blackhat and b-sides Las

35
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:53,649
Vegas and Def Con all back to back in

36
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,270
the summertime and we affectionately

37
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:58,930
started calling it hacker summer camp

38
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:03,399
and so this last summer I was at hacker

39
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:06,479
summer camp and I had already attended

40
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:12,520
the first day of besides Las Vegas and

41
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:16,150
it was day two and I got a text from my

42
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,540
boss that morning that said can you hop

43
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,989
on

44
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:23,950
quick call at 8:30 year time and it was

45
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:26,579
pretty early it was you know 6:30 Vegas

46
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,738
time if memory serves but I was up and

47
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:33,010
you know getting ready and wanted to get

48
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:35,680
to be size on time

49
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,429
and so I texted him back and said yes

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,659
either's fine

51
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,489
and then I went checked my calendar to

52
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:45,040
see if he was going to add a meeting to

53
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:51,879
my calendar and I wasn't seeing it pop

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:54,129
on him to my calendar and then 703 he

55
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:58,328
said can I call you now and I said yes

56
00:02:54,129 --> 00:03:02,168
and a few minutes later my phone rang

57
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:05,230
from a number that was not his and from

58
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:09,189
what I recognized was a one of our

59
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:12,849
conference room numbers so I answered

60
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:18,250
the phone and it was my boss telling me

61
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:19,959
that I was being laid off and you know

62
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,299
there was a lot of things going on that

63
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,780
were out of you know our control

64
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:30,269
financially and whatnot and I was being

65
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:35,199
let go the blow was that I was in Vegas

66
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:37,239
at a conference you know on behalf of

67
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:41,409
the company I was working for at the

68
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,449
time and you know it's difficult to be

69
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:45,578
told that you're being laid off you take

70
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:46,930
it very personally which I did at the

71
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:50,979
time

72
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:53,829
and it was just hard to hear so you know

73
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:55,629
I kind of tried to catch myself and

74
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,370
figure out what I needed to do next and

75
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:59,620
my first thought was you know go to

76
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,120
b-sides you know immediately start

77
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,370
talking to all of her careers they're

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,340
connecting with them you know you got

79
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,620
this I just wasn't feeling it at the

80
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,310
time and I just didn't feel like I could

81
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:14,049
have a a thoughtful conversation about

82
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,269
what had just happened to me a couple of

83
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:18,280
hours earlier and and then you know

84
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:21,639
shift and try to go quickly find another

85
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:24,849
job so I ended up decided to fly home

86
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:27,219
early and leave hacker summer camp I

87
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:28,349
just didn't feel like I could spend any

88
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:31,219
more time there I'm

89
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:34,950
Vegas is hard as it is so I ended up

90
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:40,500
jumping on a plane came home but before

91
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:42,300
I'd left I sent how to tweet and my

92
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,140
Twitter is that jet-setting bet and I

93
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,930
set that up very long ago when I was

94
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,700
traveling all the time for business and

95
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,000
it just I have no idea how I come up

96
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:56,849
with anyways and so I sent out a tweet

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,620
and my tweet said here's a blow go to

98
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,840

99
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,580
laid off while you're out there yes it

100
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:09,960
happened to me and four of my colleagues

101
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:15,060
within minutes I had new followers I had

102
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:18,710
retweets I had DMS my DMS were so full

103
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:21,330
that I couldn't answer fast enough

104
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,489
people were retweeting people were

105
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,820

help you

112
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:45,120
it was an incredible change and what had

113
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,630
just happened and people I didn't really

114
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,440
know in person were offering to help

115
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,610
we're saying send me your resume and

116
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,890

who can I connect you with can you meet

118
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:01,440
it was just an incredible response and

119
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,150
that was a huge relief to me because you

120
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,480
know his hearing that you just got laid

121
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:10,229
off and then having this response from

122
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:12,750
you know this community was an amazing

123
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:17,910
thing for me and kind of set things in

124
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:22,230
motion from that point forward so where

125
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:25,260
did this all start I didn't go to

126
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,900
college to get a CS degree or an

127
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,240
electrical engineering degree my degrees

128
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,450
in psychology which actually fits me

129
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,680
perfectly but when I got out of college

130
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:40,449
I wanted to join the FBI and at the time

131
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,870
they were not hiring

132
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:49,210
so I moved to Washington DC or I knew

133
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:51,939
one person and started working some temp

134
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:55,359
jobs and kind of stumbled into a

135
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:57,639
government contractor where I had the

136
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,629
opportunity to I was doing database

137
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:04,360
entry and the director of IT came to me

138
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:07,449
and said you see McMartin what you're

139
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,099
doing in this database entry stuff if I

140
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,580
got you some training would you be

141
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:17,438
interested in joining my team so I said

142
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,758
yes and he threw me into Novell 3x

143
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,990
training I don't know if anyone

144
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:26,469
remembers that Lotus Notes Windows I

145
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:29,979
mean this is early Windows so tells you

146
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:32,050
that I'm old but yeah I started working

147
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:35,318
and learning all about networks and

148
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,990
networking and email which was very new

149
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:41,979
at the time and Windows 95 I remember

150
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:45,580
the first time I saw Windows 95 and it

151
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,960
was really interesting and cool and you

152
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,169
know I was clicking around and thought

153
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:54,909
what am I doing here anyway so I spent

154
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:56,770
four years learning networking I'm

155
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,360
looking at my slide it says cabling and

156
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,870
stockings I worked for a government

157
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,449
contractor and we were required to wear

158
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,789
business dress every day and I remember

159
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:09,789
crawling around on the data center floor

160
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:14,080
and a skirt and stockings and heels

161
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:17,610
pulling cables and connecting servers I

162
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,289
mean it was horrible and I have no idea

163
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,539
why I thought it was a good idea to wear

164
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:24,248
skirts and stockings but it was you know

165
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:27,339
part of how we had to dress when I was

166
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:29,919
at this government contractor but living

167
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:31,870
in DC was cold and expensive and I

168
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,110
decided I needed to live somewhere else

169
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:38,709
so I moved to Atlanta in 97 so post

170
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:42,459
Olympics and started working for what I

171
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:44,339
only call the airline so I'm sure

172
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:47,939
everybody can guess where I was working

173
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:52,360
and I was doing lots of tech support

174
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:53,920
lots of software testing you know

175
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,660
learning everything about the

176
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,439
which was an amazing thing at the time

177
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:02,920
because I learned a ton about working at

178
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:04,209
the airline and I spoke to pilots and

179
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,910
flight attendants and people who worked

180
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,258
at the gates and reservations and you

181
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:12,459
know people who worked in the general

182
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:14,829
office I was really you know invested in

183
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:18,790
in what I was doing at the airline and

184
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:21,099
what I was learning and I got to see

185
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,868
really cool things you know Delta made a

186
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,999
huge shift what they called Airport

187
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:26,619
renewal and they were getting off with

188
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:29,769
at the time what they call green screens

189
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:32,319
and moving to Windows workstations and

190
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:34,629
that was a massive shift for the airline

191
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:38,079
industry at the time and it was actually

192
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:41,859
very cool to be a part of it to see and

193
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,269
I got to go out to the gates and you

194
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:45,999
know they would shed a gate down at

195
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:47,949
night and we would walk up and just

196
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:50,019
immediately yank all the equipment out

197
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:52,679
and start cabling up all of the new

198
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:55,329
workstations which were Windows machines

199
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,980
you know getting that ready we would

200
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,628
call it gate renewal and then the next

201
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,139
day when that gate came up you know it

202
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:05,110
was on all new machines all new software

203
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:09,600
and just a very big shift for the

204
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:16,209
airline and so I did that until about

205
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:20,519
2006 and then I decided well a big event

206
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:22,719
happened in 2006 I had my daughter and

207
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,319
that's her one of her first baby

208
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,079
pictures her name is Regan and I'm sure

209
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:31,929
if anybody has had children you realize

210
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:33,910
very quickly how much your life changes

211
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:39,129
when you have a child and your priority

212
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:41,019
shift and you want to do big things with

213
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:44,499
all you know you have another human that

214
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:47,589
you're responsible for and I decided I

215
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:51,249
was you know I had a lot of security

216
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:53,709
friends and I decided I wanted to shift

217
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:57,939
a little bit more out of IT and jump

218
00:10:53,709 --> 00:11:02,498
into security so I went to my boss at

219
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:04,029
the time and he said you know what do

220
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:06,699
you want to do and I said I think I want

221
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:07,630
to do IT project management I'm a

222
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,949
natural organized

223
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,189
so I thought it would be a great fit for

224
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:15,610
me and he said perfect I've got the

225
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:18,550
airline has to get PCI compliant and so

226
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:22,810
how about you go manage that and at the

227
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:23,890
time I didn't know what pci was and I

228
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,459
didn't really know what that meant for

229
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:30,880
the airline so I jumped into the deep

230
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:34,150
the deep part of the pool and I said

231
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,670
let's do this and in the end it was the

232
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:40,240
smartest and best thing I did with my

233
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:44,229
career because it shifted me away from

234
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:47,380
just being an IT but to security and you

235
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:50,770
know for better for worse you know about

236
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:54,300
PCI you know people hate it and it gets

237
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:56,740
just a checkbox but I learned a ton and

238
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,599
you know we were responsible there's a

239
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,240
ton of credit cards floating through an

240
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,640
airline system and I had a huge

241
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,090
responsibility and I had to you know

242
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,439
quickly learn when I was walked talking

243
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,660
to the networking team what they were

244
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,060
talking about when it came to firewalls

245
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,000
and to the routers and how to you know

246
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,630
what those changes meant and so you know

247
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,400
I spent a lot of time listening and

248
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,590
going back to people and asking for

249
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,730
their you know input and saying you know

250
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:29,230
teach me this how can I learn this and I

251
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,200
don't do well with just reading books

252
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:35,770
I am learned you so I you know ask

253
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,260
people to show me and to kind of guide

254
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:42,370
me and it just all started clicking and

255
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:44,380
making sense and I just decided you know

256
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,940
this is what I'm going to do I am going

257
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,830
to really stick with this and not

258
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,380
necessarily just PCI but I really wanted

259
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:53,830
to broaden in security and it's what I

260
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,300
did and I had a you know a lot of

261
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,960
opportunities from people who really

262
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:02,650
just you know pulled me up and gave me

263
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:04,720
an opportunity so I was you know got the

264
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,449
airline PCI compliant which is huge and

265
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,330
then went into you know steady state and

266
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,850
still continuing what I was doing but

267
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:15,100
when I was there you know we brought in

268
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,230
a lot of consultants to help us with the

269
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,270
project and I got very close with them

270
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,080
because we travel together we had to go

271
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,790
to all the airports and

272
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,959
see how each airport was functioning

273
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,480
differently and how they were managing

274
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:28,880
credit cards and all this stuff so I got

275
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,720
very close with all of the consultants I

276
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,089
was working with to the point where they

277
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,209
asked me if I was ever interested in

278
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:40,519
leaving the airline and the thought of

279
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:43,609
jumping and to consulting had never

280
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:46,640
crossed my mind I didn't think that it

281
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,130
was something I was geared for and being

282
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,079
at the airline was a fairly safe I mean

283
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,269
you know there's lots of ups and downs

284
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:55,969
in the airline obviously there's a lot

285
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:58,040
right now but it was a fairly stable

286
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:02,029
position for me and I was proud of what

287
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,790
I had accomplished and but the

288
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:09,410
opportunity was just too enticing and so

289
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:11,630
in 2010 I left and went to work for one

290
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:15,110
of my mentors who I respect incredibly

291
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:17,660
his name is Brandon Williams and I went

292
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:22,160
and worked at EMC and RSA RSA had just

293
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:25,300
joined forces with EMC at the time and I

294
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,740
was going to be a security consultant

295
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:32,089
and honestly I didn't really know what

296
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:35,360
that meant and I remember going into my

297
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:39,110
first client which was in Minneapolis

298
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,930
and I had read the statement of work and

299
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,060
I knew the RSA tools that were going to

300
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,550
get deployed but I was coming in ahead

301
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,279
of the RSA jewelz they were about to get

302
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:52,729
DLP and I needed to prepare the

303
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,070
organization to get DLP before they just

304
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,649
flipped the switch and I thought what am

305
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:02,120
I doing here what am I talking about

306
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:04,610
what do I need to do I needed a plan I

307
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,339
needed a playlist of what I was going to

308
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:10,010
do and I was there and it just wasn't

309
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:13,279
obvious to me so I called another one of

310
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:15,230
my mentors and I said I have no idea

311
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,750
what I'm doing and I'm gonna get fired

312
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:20,300
and they're gonna think I'm a fraud and

313
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,370
he said no no you know exactly what

314
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,550
you're doing you were fully prepared for

315
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:27,500
this you are going to walk in and you're

316
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:31,329
going to do what you do Yvette he said

317
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,949
you are personable and you're smart and

318
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:34,829
you know what you're doing you just feel

319
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:36,839
like you don't know what

320
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:38,640
doing but you're gonna go in and you're

321
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,650
gonna set some meetings and you're gonna

322
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,230
listen and you're going to figure it out

323
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:46,199
and he said I promise you within 24

324
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:48,210
hours you're gonna feel much more safe

325
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,310
about what you're doing than you did

326
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,400
before and he was absolutely right I

327
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:56,010
followed that instruction and I did and

328
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,319
it was my first engagement and I believe

329
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,930
it was fairly successful but it gave me

330
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,450
the confidence to continue growing in

331
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:06,000
that space and learning and you know

332
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,220
realizing that I can trust what I'm

333
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,780
doing and you know I'm not gonna know

334
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,100
everything right away and that's what

335
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,650
you do when you first go in as a

336
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,210
consultant you are sucking from the

337
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,550
firehose and you're learning everything

338
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,560
about that network and about teams and

339
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,829
about politics in the organization and

340
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:27,119
how they run and I quickly figured that

341
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:30,900
out out so what a consulting you know

342
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,250
technically consultants advice they pull

343
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,050
from their experience industry

344
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,710
understanding problem solving abilities

345
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:39,689
and offer valuable advice what people

346
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,550
have told me in a joking way what

347
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,200
consultants really do is they borrow

348
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,829
your watch and tell you the time and

349
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,680
charge you for it which that's why I

350
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,720
call this adult daycare because it just

351
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,520
seems funny for me to go into

352
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,860
organizations and tell people what to do

353
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,829
and how to do it and sometimes I still

354
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,829
think you know you could learn this you

355
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:07,290
know this why are you bringing me in why

356
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,730
are you paying me to come in and and I

357
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:11,760
feel like tell you what you already know

358
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:14,099
but you know not everybody does know

359
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,079
what I know and or you know they don't

360
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,599
have the same experience that I do and

361
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,839
so you know I've grabbed onto that and

362
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,879
really hung clung to it and you know

363
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,679
reminded myself that the information I

364
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,400
have an experience I have is very

365
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:34,200
valuable I you know was a qsa for a

366
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:36,540
while and I hated every second of it

367
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,150
I didn't I loved the work and I loved

368
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,670
what I was learning I didn't love

369
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:45,000
writing reports and I certainly didn't

370
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:48,650
feel comfortable signing my name to a

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,140
report when I didn't feel comfortable

372
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,870
that you know the next day there

373
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,390
wouldn't be a breach and somebody would

374
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,429
come to me and say hey of it

375
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,380
you said they were compliant and now

376
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,050
this is happening that was very scary

377
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,080
for me but I loved the work and I ended

378
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:08,930
up that was a short stint for my life

379
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,510
and I ended up maintaining the qsa and

380
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:14,210
going to PwC which was an incredible

381
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:17,090
opportunity for me because I respected

382
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,700
PwC a lot and I had worked with their

383
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:22,970
consultants before and it was a huge

384
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,160
opportunity and I decided I was going to

385
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,230
jump in and even though I had a small

386
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:31,640
child at the time I knew it was going to

387
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:33,830
be taxing on my time on my life and that

388
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,470
but I knew I would learn a lot in a very

389
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:40,220
short period of time and I did I learned

390
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,930
a ton and you know I traveled and I got

391
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,180
to go to cool places and then I got to

392
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:47,450
go to not so cool places when it was you

393
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:50,690
know freezing cold outside I had great

394
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,880
clients and I saw very cool things I did

395
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,520
reach response and you know when

396
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,500
people's hair is on fire and they're

397
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,420
just trying to stop the bleeding I got

398
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,070
to participate in in you know

399
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,630
opportunities like that engagements like

400
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,149
that and I got to work with some of the

401
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,280
smartest people I've ever worked for and

402
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,520
that was an incredible opportunity for

403
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:15,139
me and you know very thrilling I also

404
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:17,060
got to join a podcast so if immitating

405
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:21,110
is the southern-fried security podcast

406
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:25,300
which here's our here's our sticker I

407
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:27,379
found these yesterday I joined that and

408
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,260
again that was another thing that I

409
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,900
thought I have no idea what I'm doing

410
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:36,440
and probably the first few podcasts that

411
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,780
I was on I didn't talk very much because

412
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,910
I just didn't know how to podcast or

413
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,280
what to say or where to jump in and it

414
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,980
took me a few podcasts in before I

415
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,480
finally found my footing and to the

416
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,190
point where you know there was times

417
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,350
where not everybody could join the

418
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:56,750
podcast and I was doing it you know by

419
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:58,580
myself or with nobody else joining me

420
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,290
and leading these podcasts but it was

421
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:05,510
actually very cool and I

422
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:09,290
loved it so I joined the executive

423
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:11,390
Weiser II board for an Issa that was

424
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,879
awkward that was given to me as an

425
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,549
opportunity and I I'm sorry it's the

426
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,090
editorial advisory board so we review

427
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:22,970
all the submissions for the journal

428
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:25,220
before the journal comes out and that is

429
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,140
a really cool thing because I get to

430
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,710
read all these different articles and

431
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:33,169
and read about what people are doing and

432
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:39,230
their opinion and facts and very cool

433
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:43,010
thing then I left PwC for very personal

434
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:45,020
reasons it was just time and I had some

435
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:48,350
personal things going on in my life that

436
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:51,200
I needed to change and shift so I left

437
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:54,500
and went to work for a start-up which

438
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,049
was really cool I didn't you know what I

439
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:01,220
knew about the cloud was probably you

440
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:05,090
know this much and when I left you know

441
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,410
I know this much and it you know working

442
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,299
at a start-up everything was very

443
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:13,820
cutting edge and moved really quickly

444
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:16,160
and there was no red tape you just did

445
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,439
things and I didn't have to go through

446
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,500
you know 20 different people to get

447
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,900
approval and things had to go quickly

448
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,150
and I had to learn quickly and so that

449
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,970
was an opportunity for me to learn you

450
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:32,150
know more about the cloud and AWS and

451
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:34,580
how security works in AWS and yes I know

452
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,809
the cloud is still a computer but you

453
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,799
know things are very different in the

454
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:42,770
cloud and I got to learn about you know

455
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:46,730
kubernetes and you know docker and

456
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:49,160
containerization and github and putting

457
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,380
your code in github and I just another

458
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,840
opportunity where I learned a ton in a

459
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:57,049
very short period of time and you know

460
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,879
when I was there I was focusing on you

461
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:01,850
know everything security so I was

462
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,130
responsible for everything GRC so you

463
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,809
know I did all of you know the risks

464
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:09,049
that came through I was working on

465
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:11,299
privacy they decided they wanted to get

466
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:13,650
one of the solutions PCI compliant so I

467
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:16,350
had to figure out how to take a clouds

468
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,270
through pci we worked on a lot of

469
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,820
compliance initiatives I was responsible

470
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:23,070
for security awareness I launched

471
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,409
phishing campaigns

472
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,480
I met with again some of the smartest

473
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,700
people I've ever worked with before and

474
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,000
learned a ton in a very short period of

475
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:36,420
time you know everybody was very helpful

476
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,220
and rolled their sleeves a sleeves up to

477
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,710
get stuff done and we were there and

478
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,520
that was a huge help to me and I

479
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:48,990
actually loved every minute of it and

480
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:52,050
then so it was 2017 and the picture that

481
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:55,440
you see on the right I'm a huge soccer

482
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:58,080
fan specifically Manchester United and

483
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,090
Lady United and I don't love this

484
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,370
picture because it's a picture of me I

485
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,320
love this picture because of the guy in

486
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,610
the background my friend took this

487
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,350
picture of me actually my friends a

488
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:10,860
daughter took this picture of she and I

489
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:12,809
and it kind of captures me perfectly you

490
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,370
know with a smile on my face and you

491

492
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,939
loved being in Atlanta United matches

493
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:20,490
but the guy in the background who's

494
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,309
chugging the beer I just think this

495
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,960
picture is hilarious because we just

496
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:27,480
happened to capture it and he's chugging

497
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,920
that beer and I don't even know that guy

498
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,929
but I just thought it was a funny

499
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:37,350
picture anyway so 2017 a very dear

500
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:40,230
friend at the time a dear person in my

501
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:43,050
life came to me and said you know do you

502
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,400
know any pen testers do you know anyone

503
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,860
who can write an information security

504
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,040
policy do you know anything about you

505
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:54,030
know the the New York the my DFS

506
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:56,250
cybersecurity guidelines and I said yeah

507
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,889
me I can write an information security

508
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,330
policy I do know pen testers these are

509
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,950
all my friends these are the people I

510
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,379
hang out with these are the people I go

511
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:07,559
to B sides with yes I do know pen

512
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:12,150
testers yes I knew I do know about these

513
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:14,700
guidelines and it was been said you know

514
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:18,570
you should start a company and my first

515
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,880
thought was what no I'm I'm not starting

516
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,220
a company what are you talking about and

517
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,200
I thought you know what maybe I'll crank

518
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,929
out some policies and

519
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,330
maybe we'll do a couple pen tests you

520
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:33,480
know this will be great vacation money

521
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:37,379
and so I kind of just stumbled into this

522
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,450
I started a company and you know we came

523
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,149
up with a name and we register it with a

524
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:45,090
state and this was supposed to be part

525
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:46,469
time and and it was for a long time you

526
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:50,070
know I was doing this after hours I

527
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:51,960
focused on my my day job and was doing

528
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:55,470
that and then would come home and do

529
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,789
some work on my own company and um but

530
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,889
my company was building and it was

531
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:00,929
getting traction and I was juggling a

532
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:03,240
lot I was spending you know long nights

533
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:05,880
and part of my weekend and early

534
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,309
mornings and my lunch time you know

535
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,649
jumping on calls with clients and it was

536
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:13,010
becoming a lot and I was beginning to

537
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:15,719
think that there was going to be a time

538
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:19,620
either I needed to make a choice and

539
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,370
either I needed to jump into my company

540
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,399
and do it full-time

541
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:26,850
or I needed to step away and hand it

542
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:31,168
over until I was maybe fully ready to do

543
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:34,980
that and so um you know then as things

544
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:37,559
happen things happen so you know then

545
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:41,190
back to September 19 are September of

546
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:44,460
2019 you know I had lost you know I lost

547
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:46,080
my job in August and my first part my

548
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,460
first thinking was you know one of the

549
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,100
smartest things I ever do is I always

550
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:53,549
have my resume current I was able to

551
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,678
quickly send out my resume and talk with

552
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:59,760
recruiters and have calls and do

553
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:02,100
interviews and I had offers and but in

554
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,289
the back of my mind I thought maybe this

555
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,510
is you know the universe giving me this

556
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:09,389
push that I need and maybe you should

557
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:11,220
just do your company um I had just been

558
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:14,760
in Vegas with my business partners and

559
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,559
you know we'd had a very poignant

560
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,840
conversation to say which one of us is

561
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,779
gonna leave our full-time job first and

562
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,970
it ended up being me and it was a push

563
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:27,419
that was uncomfortable and scary at the

564
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:29,760
time and I took very personally but in

565
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:31,740
the end it was the right thing and I

566
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,960
decided you know I'm gonna do this I'm

567
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,909
gonna make this work I'm going to I'm

568
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,039
gonna do this company I you know I

569
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:38,940
started this let's let's do this let's

570
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:42,420
jump in

571
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,090
and so I did you know I started reaching

572
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,590
out to Mike on clients I started you

573
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,659
know in the past I'd been saying no to

574
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,800
engagements because I couldn't travel I

575
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,170
couldn't you know I didn't have

576
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,940
full-time hours I could only offer you

577
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,350
know very limited hours a week and I

578
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,960
started going back to those clients and

579
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,929
saying I have time I have bandwidth I

580
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,380
have availability let's go and that's

581
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:07,170
what I did so today I am the Managing

657
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:38,700

658
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:46,799
presentations it's very nice

659
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:52,230
with that I think major surprising

660
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:55,320
lessons learned starting a company you

661
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:58,909
know I don't I didn't know you know how

662
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:04,590
do how do you set up billing how do you

663
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:05,549
how do you I I'm I have a tendency to

664
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,789
want to give away my

665
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:11,850
I give away my time and just because I

666
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:13,230
love what I do so much and so you know I

667
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,498
had to learn that my time is valuable

668
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,100
and I'm not gonna you know just give it

669
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,009
away

670
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:22,100
and how to build people for it and how

671
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:26,159
to actually collect money from people

672
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:28,049
that is a difficult thing to do that's

673
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,649
not something I knew how to do and so I

674
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:35,869
learned a lot and just how to you know

675
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:37,979
run a business and and how do you know

676
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:40,590
figure it out along the way and I've

677
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,769
made mistakes but I bounced back and I

678
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:53,459
made it work so those are one of my

679
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:54,720
biggest lessons learned okay I don't see

680
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:58,649
any more questions but I see lots of

681
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,879
great comments and oh tell me how you

682
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:01,590
would get your foot in the door with a

683
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:08,070
security company being fresh out of

684
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:11,519
school that is difficult because in this

685
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:14,700
industry they want you to it's hard to

686
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:19,499
prove yourself and I am very lucky you

687
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:21,029
know I I have a a good resume and so you

688
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:23,970
know like I said I don't have any degree

689
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:27,119
or CS degree but you know keep reaching

690
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:29,669
out to people in in that company and you

691
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,799
know see if there's an opportunity to

692
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:33,239
just meet with anybody who works on the

693
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:36,239
team that you want to work with and just

694
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:38,850
grab a coffee or grab a drink and

695
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:41,129
connect with them you have to be able to

696
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,289
prove that you you know what you know

697
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:44,699
and it's hard to do that without being

698
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:48,179
able to get your foot in the door or get

699
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,519
past a recruiter so you know try to find

700
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,649

701
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,470
b-sides you know you're you never know
