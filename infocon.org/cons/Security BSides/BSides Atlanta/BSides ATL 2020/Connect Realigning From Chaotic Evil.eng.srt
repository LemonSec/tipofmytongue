1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:07,180
good afternoon my name is Joe shopman

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,510
this is the talk realigning from chaotic

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,279
evil just a little bit about me I'm a

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:16,029
senior security analyst for truest

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:17,800
formerly BB&T I'm a geek I was a wizard

6
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:20,109
who was killed by a rat I'll get back to

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,550
that a little bit later I've done a

8
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:22,269
little just at everything at some point

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,339
or other NIT

10
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:26,948
done application security pen testing

11
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:27,668
blue team red team purple team I our

12
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:29,949
DevOps

13
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:32,259
operations I wrote web applications for

14
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:34,300
university and was also sysadmin

15
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,890
so that's given me a kind of wide

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,370
perspective on the number of different

17
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:42,730
things within both computer i.t i.t and

18
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,530
security overall the obligatory

19
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,290
disclaimer I am NOT speaking on behalf

20
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,780
of truest BB&T or any other entity all

21
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,940
opinions expressed are my own all the

22
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,400
images are Bleakley be believed to be

23
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,019
public domain creative commons used with

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,050
permission or created by me for this

25
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,040
presentation

26
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,989
an additional is claimer

27
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,539
I am NOT just talking about my employers

28
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,189
in this talk so if you hear me saying

29
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,020
bad things about companies don't look at

30
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:09,669
my LinkedIn and say well gosh I'll never

31
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,109
work for any of those companies because

32
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,520
these are stories gathered from a lot of

33
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:14,408
my friends and peers within a lot of

34
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,840
different groups a lot of the really big

35
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,670
names of security I'm in Raleigh North

36
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,979
Carolina and there's quite a few

37
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:27,760
companies here that specialize in

38
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:29,710
security and what

39
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,200
other disclaimer I'm not actually a D&D

40
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,369
guru I'm gonna miss you some terms so if

41
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,540
you're really devout geek you're

42
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,580
probably gonna get a little bit upset

43
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,770
with me so I threw in this extra slide

44
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:42,429
to let you know that I'm tensional II

45
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:44,590
miss using things here so why am I

46
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,580
giving this talk there is a growing

47
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,430
force that I wanted to make sure that

48
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:52,509
everyone's aware of in 2020 and that's

49
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,920
works if you look here at this Gandalf

50
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,260
Magic Quadrant you'll see that there's a

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,120
number of things there's the old undead

52
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,280
players that Windows XP and Kobol are

53
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,840
still lurking around there's advanced

54
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,900
persistent dragons coming up the

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,100
gelatinous cube is the visionaries but

56
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,110
they're not quite and fully to

57
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:14,170
operations but in that upper right-hand

58
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:16,180
corner definitely it works so seriously

59
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,530
why am I giving this talk if you're

60
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,480
wondering if you should watch this talk

61
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,700
or bail the things I'm going to talk

62
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,170
about are trying to give some insight on

63
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,670
how to align your security processes

64
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,250
with the incentives that drive other

65
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,859
people they reminder on how others

66
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,030
perceive security groups and suggestions

67
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,390
on how to better work to improve

68
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,390
security

69
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,020
so I could have done this as a really

70
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,520
dry thing you know more proper slide

71
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,690
title might have been rely on the

72
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,000
corporate security objectives to

73
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,829
synergize efficiencies and I think

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,940
that's at least 180 drinkable offenses

75
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,970
for giving talks of its security

76
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,740
conferences but if you don't like the

77
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,570
D&D theme you can also think of this in

78
00:02:52,740 --> 00:03:00,990
part as had a social engineering way to

79
00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:03,120
security success so going back to what I

80
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:04,470
was saying corporations don't often

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,340
align incentives with increasing

82
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:10,290
security the stock doesn't attempt to

83
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,640
get people on board with being aware of

84
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,420
the problems and then trying to help fix

85
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,920
it when I first started an IT I talked

86
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,390
to a lot with a good friend and he was

87
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,220
working at a really big company that

88
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,049
does routers and he was very upset

89
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,530
because he had a co-worker that would

90
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,540
only go after the targets after the

91
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,850
projects that the management was highly

92
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,109
incentivizing so if was something that

93
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,030
he knew he was going to get rewarded for

94
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,810
either financially or with face time

95
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,000
with the bigwigs

96
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,290
he would do it and it was something that

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,209
he figured out that management didn't

98
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,700
care that much about he basically would

99
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,110
put no effort in on it and my friend was

100
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,530
very upset about this and thought it was

101
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:49,590
unjust and unfair and to an extent he's

102
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,560
right taken to an extreme that's a true

103
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,880
that's a valid complaint but at the core

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,530
of the problem if management is

105
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,640
incentivizing the correct things and

106
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,470
desperate were doing the things that

107
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,549
keeps the business functioning that's

108
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,230
actually a management problem

109
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:06,390
not necessarily problems of the

110
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,470
individual in general what I found is

111
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,589
people will do what they're incentivized

112
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,230
to do the big incentives the

113
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,209
corporations and bigger groups or work

114
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,738
type groups is what their bonuses are

115
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,530
based on what the performance reviews

116
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,298
are based on that sort of thing but

117
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,929
there's also other incentives like what

118
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:26,219
they ascend buys themselves to do so

119
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,390
during this talk keep in mind both the

120
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,520
things that they're gonna be written up

121
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,919
for if they don't do or get dinged for

122
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,890
or the things that leak getting larger

123
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,780
but honest because of but also there's

124
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,940
the internal incentives so there's

125
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,280
things like what they get inside a lot

126
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,810
of internal satisfaction from there's

127
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,280
people that will have pet projects that

128
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,690
may or may not make sense to put a lot

129
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,590
of effort into but because they really

130
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,090
love the technology

131
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,880
stack or they've invested a lot of time

132
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,560
into it they may be motivated internally

133
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,560
to keep putting a lot of effort into it

134
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,340
so to go back to the theme of this if

135
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,590
you're completely unaware of what D&D or

136
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,359
a D&D is it's a fantasy role-playing

137
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,000
game that's basically a form of

138
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,250
collaborative storytelling and it's

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,160
mediated by the help of dice so you get

140
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,110
together in a group and you tell a story

141
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,580
together there's a person called the

142
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,110
dungeon master who's leading the plot

143
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,359
who figures out what's going to happen

144
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,460
and then different players react to what

145
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,230
the dungeon master is describing as

146
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,430
things happening you roll dice and that

147
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,590
determines whether you're successful or

148
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,660
not it was inspired by Tolkien's Lord of

149
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,539
the Ring mythos so it lies heavily on

150
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:35,780
elves and wasn't that sort of thing it

151
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:38,460
was also a pipe used heavily in the

152
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,539
stranger things TV series so it's had a

153
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,830
resurgence of popularity because of that

154
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,630
as I mentioned earlier I was a wizard

155
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,150
killed by a rat this was my first

156
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,940
exposure to D&D I think I was third or

157
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,710
fourth grade and it was a party of one

158
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,050
maybe it was just me and the dungeon

159
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,520
master and I wanted to play something

160
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,980
really cool so I picked a wizard and

161
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,289
within about an hour of gameplay a rat

162
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:06,060
bit me once and I died so that was kind

163
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:08,670
of not cool kind of not fun the indie

164
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,190
has this core concept of alignment which

165
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:14,550
is what is the character that you're

166
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,080
playing nature what sort of things do

167
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,780
they indulge in what sort of things

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,210
motivate them to do things this is a fun

169
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:24,119
kick comic I found from a gentleman

170
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,849
tinker tanner as a note if you're easily

171
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,340
offended this is on the not very

172
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,230
offensive scale of his sort of humor so

173
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,260
if you don't enjoy crass humor do not

174
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,550
look up his Instagram but if you do he's

175
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:43,099
got a number of things both the indie

176
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:44,240
and non D&D a themed normally and they

177
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,130
talk where I'm face-to-face I'd be

178
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,270
waiting to be showing the entire comic

179
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,310
with the punchline and waiting to hear

180
00:06:47,270 --> 00:07:00,680
laughs so I'm going to give a moment to

181
00:06:49,310 --> 00:07:02,390
read it and hopefully at least slightly

182
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:09,500
amuse and there's a chocolate chip out

183
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:11,500
there in the audience so there's two

184
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,030
basic sides of alignment within D&D and

185
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,740
in some ways they align with what you

186
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,109
see in corporations there's the good

187
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,290
altruistic side their respect for law

188
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:24,170
dignity and tends to make personal

189
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:27,260
sacrifices to help out evil is more

190
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:30,980
pretty self-explanatory it's harming

191
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:34,430
killing others lack of compassion etc

192
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,650
etc there's also a sort of middle ground

193
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:41,900
called neutral and as you can imagine

194
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:44,000
it's neutral then each one of those has

195
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,489
categories where there can be lawful or

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,710
chaotic sides within each of them so

197
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:52,540
that there is lawful where they do the

198
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,739
good things they follow the rules and

199
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,880
this gets a little bit closer to what we

200
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,800
see in some of the corporate line meant

201
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,740
that when you're a lawful player within

202
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,770
the blue team you may have to rely on

203
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:07,670
tradition there may be a lack of it

204
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:09,799
adaptability and on the other opposite

205
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,780
side there's chaos that's completely

206
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,750
unbridled they don't care about anything

207
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,599
there's no rule following an example I

208
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,850
use here you can be lawful and evil at

209
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,220
the same time so if you're working for a

210
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,160
foreign governments apt or even our

211
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,600
governments apt and you're going at you

212
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,490
may be doing things they're illicit you

213
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,200
may be hacking other company countries

214
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,030
and companies but you're still following

215
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,030
by the rules there's probably some kind

216
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,679
of HR guidebook that you have to follow

217
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:39,199
if you don't if you step outside there

218
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,478
it's rules you may be fired or more

219
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,070
severely disciplined then there's the

220
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,900
complete chaos the script kiddies who

221
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,400
are just out for the lols the people who

222
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,530
want to just boss things have a good

223
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,699
time make a lot of money that's more the

224
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,699
chaotic evil side of things

225
00:08:53,050 --> 00:09:00,579
putting together group for a D&D you

226
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:03,339
want to have similar alignments in this

227
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,300
illustration that I found on Flickr if

228
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:08,920
you have a bunch of good characters and

229
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,229
you have a bunch of evil characters and

230
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,579
you try to put them in the same group

231
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,740
the story that you tell is not going to

232
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:16,239
have good synergy it's going to be at a

233
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,790
conflict between the two sets of players

234
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,769
back and forth rather than between the

235
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,510
what the dungeon master the game master

236
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,329
is trying to set up and the players

237
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,680
working together as a team

238
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:28,779
you get the necromancers together and

239
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,899
the clerics together and they're just

240
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:38,680
going to fight offensive security

241
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:40,209
application security red teaming often

242
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,250
is you're getting to play that you're

243
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:46,630
evil it's the fun part it's a glamorous

244
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:48,850
part of the job when I say red team in

245
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,250
the context of this talk I'm just using

246
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,260
it as offensive security in general true

247
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,769
red teaming is more adversary emulation

248
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,569
but the industry is kind of adopted the

249
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:00,610
term red for offensive and blue for

250
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:03,520
defensive so I'm using that within the

251
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,740
talk you get a lot of the glamour you

252
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,209
get a lot of the good pay you get to go

253
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,820
to the fun conferences and this can lead

254
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:15,489
to some the blue team the defensive side

255
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,370
can feel like you're actually there the

256
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:22,420
adversary rather than just emulating it

257
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,800
you're causing them problems at the end

258
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,689
of the day if you're making their lives

259
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,699
harder there's not that much difference

260
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,089
between in how they perceive you between

261
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:34,589
you and an actual legal person about to

262
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:34,589
get money or disrupted to business

263
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,520
there's some common red team incentives

264
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,790
that I've seen it can be objective based

265
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,610
so it can be hack the box kit she'll get

266
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,079
rootkit domain admin it could be to

267
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,390
generate scare reports that can be

268
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,729
handed off to auditors or off to

269
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,290
management that says we got into the

270
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,199
systems and we got no leads or credit

271
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:59,890
card information x' and red ceos private

272
00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:04,229
emails work simply be quantitative like

273
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:04,230
do n number test within a given quarter

274
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,540
going back to the blue team and I gotta

275
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,859
use blue as a generic term for good a

276
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,569
lot of the time people think of the blue

277
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,480
team is jesting the sake analysts but it

278
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,780
as also has threatened Intel and things

279
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,850
like forensics and malware analysts to

280
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,740
an extent the developers the DevOps the

281
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,270
operations teams also function as the

282
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,980
blue team because they're doing things

283
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:32,130
actually tighten down the security and

284
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,130
do the things that can help detect or

285
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:38,680
detect ongoing risk that the sock is

286
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:43,030
missing the blue team is a lot more

287
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,800
restrained than the red team so the red

288
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,420
team often gets to go out and choose

289
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,709
what they want to attack how they're

290
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,199
gonna do it when they're going to do it

291
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:53,050
that sort of thing the blue team and

292
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,780
especially the sock is often the entry

293
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,490
point into the security group there's

294
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,740
often specifically to the sock long

295
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,780
shifts there's not necessarily well a

296
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,490
lot of training given and again I'm not

297
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,990
just talking about my companies but

298
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,450
across the industry this is one of the

299
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,790
big complaints there's a common refrain

300
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,320
that people management will worry that

301
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,430
if we give the blue team training that

302
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,370
they're going to go find a better job

303
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,530
and the fact is if we don't give them

304
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,970
training and let them advance the good

305
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,569
sake analysts are going to leave and get

306
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,770
better jobs anyway there's problems with

307
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,690
lack of advancement there's not

308
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,240
necessarily a clear way to go from a

309
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,220
junior sock analyst position moving up

310
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,520
into either offensive security or into a

311
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,270
more advanced talk at opportunity

312
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,010
there's not necessarily a lot of

313
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,420
opportunities to learn an experiment you

314
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,250
may be on a really walk down work

315
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,219
station there may be a small number of

316
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:44,200
tools I got into a discussion on a sans

317
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,700
mailing group a couple years ago where

318
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,320
people were advocating letting the sock

319
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,110
analyst have any sort of tool that they

320
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,960
wanted in their specific instance in

321
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:58,120
their specific workstation and have

322
00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:00,730
different ways of working I argued back

323
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,080
hard that you do need to lock sock staff

324
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,060
down to your standard set of tools

325
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,620
because especially at the enterprise

326
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,900
scale they need to be under changeable

327
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,090
if someone is out you need to be able to

328
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,560
have someone else swap in and work and

329
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,350
if you're using different tool sets and

330
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,900
different methods that just doesn't work

331
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,190
and because it's not the glamorous part

332
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,740
of the job there's often not a lot of

333
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,170
funding

334
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,820
both for things like tools for the

335
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:27,260
salaries themselves and for the fun

336
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:29,630
trips to Vegas that sort of thing so the

337
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,250
blue team is differently aligned they

338
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,570
may actually fall under completely

339
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:37,190
different management than the red team

340
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:38,600
so smaller companies may both the blue

341
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,970
team of the red team well there may be

342
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,580
no differentiation between the two teams

343
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,440
or they may both report the same manager

344
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,640
but at the enterprise scale they may

345
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,220
have completely different management

346
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,110
chains recording to the scissor and that

347
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,520
can lead to conflicts because that those

348
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,490
management chains can have different

349
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,810
opinions on what needs to be done they

350
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,000
can have completely different metrics in

351
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,199
the sentence the blue team metrics are

352
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,210
often things like the number of tickets

353
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,610
closed and that can be problematic

354
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,410
because that creates an incentive if you

355
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,850
don't create that many tickets you can

356
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,790
have a really high percentage closed

357
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:13,640
rate that could be the reaction time to

358
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,140
alerts and the most important one

359
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,640
probably for the blue team is not

360
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:23,590
appearing in their newspapers ahead as

361
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:26,470
having been owned so these two sets of

362
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,940
alignments and interests and can lead to

363
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,280
problems the blue team can see the red

364
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,960
team is a force of chaotic evil the red

365
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,970
team can see the blue team is not being

366
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,250
flexible being too tied down to lawful

367
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:43,190
order and not being able or willing to

368
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:44,840
adapt to changes some other groups

369
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,370
within IT have their own incentives

370
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,890
developers aren't generally not

371
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,190
incentivized for security their bonuses

372
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:55,550
generally are dependent on things like

373
00:14:51,190 --> 00:15:00,140
is the system stable or is there new

374
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:02,300
features at a previous company we had an

375
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:06,140
interesting experience where we had the

376
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,359
Operations Group just on call and the

377
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,430
programmers had little responsibility

378
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,960
for dealing with problems so they would

379
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,180
add new feature after new feature after

380
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,400
new feature and the people who were on

381
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,530
night duty would you be paged sometimes

382
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,140
dozens of times in the night it was

383
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,939
really terrible so as an example of

384
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,069
realigning sentence what we did was we

385
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,110
made the developers also be on the knife

386
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,490
pager duty so that they were also

387
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,590
getting woken up every time the system

388
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,270
crashed and would you believe that the

389
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,210
system stability went up dramatically

390
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,470
and that's not just they win for the

391
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,420
people who want to sleep at night on the

392
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,860
operations team it was to win for the

393
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:45,260
customers who needed stable secure

394
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:47,570
stable software at the same time the

395
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,400
Operations Group are often incentivized

396
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:53,150
by uptime or speed a deployment rather

397
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:56,150
than security so there's often conflict

398
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,040
in security when you say that you know

399
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:01,040
we need to get this patch pushed and

400
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,990
it's going to take five six hours for

401
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,530
whatever reason to do that update and

402
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:08,240
the Operations Group they can't afford

403
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,069
that six hours of downtime in their

404
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,600
performance review so they're going to

405
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,610
push it back and say well can we defer

406
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,840
that for a month or q and do two months

407
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,840
worth of patches at the same time

408
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,260
management particularly management

409
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,290
outside of security is often sent advise

410
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,220
not to hear from security at all

411
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:27,680
especially if you're in a regulated

412
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,330
environment there's a regulatory risk if

413
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,079
you know about a security problem and

414
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,730
don't fix it

415
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:35,150
that can actually be worse for you than

416
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,470
not knowing about it at all so sometimes

417
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,870
management just doesn't want to hear

418
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,860
from security or if they hear from it

419
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:46,250
they're going to push back and say

420
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:48,620
what's the minimum that we can do so an

421
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,870
example of a perverse incentive these by

422
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,480
the way are some of the dice for my

423
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,910
misspent days and seven to eighth grades

424
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,190
playing way too many role-playing games

425
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,750
that one on the left is a rare xxx cider

426
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,970
that I had to trade some pretty dear

427
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:06,579
things to get and was the crown jewel of

428
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:09,200
my dice collection as a young teenager

429
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:12,589
so if you're not familiar with it in

430
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:16,760
systems operations 9s refers to the

431
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:18,379
percentage of uptime so two 9s is 99

432
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,849
percent uptime which allows a

433
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,660
substantial amount of downtime over the

434
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:27,949
course of a year three nines is 99.9

435
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:29,780
four nines 90 99.99 etc and one of the

436
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,630
mythical goals in operations is five

437
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:36,220
nines which is something like a few

438
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:38,750
minutes of downtime a month at most a

439
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,190
company was working for decided that

440
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,530
they needed have five nines of uptime

441
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,170
for the storage array so they bought

442
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:48,560
some very very nice very expensive very

443
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:52,100
redundant storage and it was capable of

444
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:55,129
delivering the five nines uptime ability

445
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:57,560
of the system to run however because it

446
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,300
was so expensive the operations group

447
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,040
didn't have enough space to offer the

448
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,129
developers and administrators enough

449
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,170
space to work with so in practice we had

450
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,460
about 95 percent uptime because

451
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,860
periodically someone would fill up the

452
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,180
entire to disk array doing something and

453
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,370
no one would be able to get work done

454
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,800
until we figured out who had created the

455
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,699
disks denial of service tracked them

456
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,870
down and get things deleted however

457
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,190
initially the Operations Group didn't

458
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,350
fix it because the metric they were

459
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:27,610
judged on was based on the NAS uptime

460
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:30,199
rather than the actual availability

461
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,490
changing that so that both they got the

462
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,320
funding to have of the proper amount of

463
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,880
space but also that it was based on

464
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,810
functional up time rather than just

465
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,420
system uptime

466
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:44,149
was an example of realigning things to

467
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:45,650
make things actually work so a lot of

468
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,380
this is way beyond our ability to change

469
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:50,690
the security practitioners if I could

470
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,430
wave a magic wand and say that you know

471
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,650
obviously we need to do things

472
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,210
differently at my corporation there's a

473
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,970
few things I might change here and there

474
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:01,550
but I don't have that power you probably

475
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:04,820
don't have that power I'm offering this

476
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,840
in hopes that you know you can bring

477
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,460
this up and your individual performance

478
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,310
reviews you can talk with your peers

479
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:14,230
about it and that over time we can start

480
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:16,940
to affect change moving away from

481
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:18,920
incentives that look good on paper or

482
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,770
easy to quantify but don't necessarily

483
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,020
increase security that's not a big win

484
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,740
for the organization and that should be

485
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,740
our actual goal

486
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:32,349
one way to do this is to learn to good

487
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:35,119
tell us tell a good story

488
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:36,289
think about what incentivize people

489
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,418
especially if you're working on the

490
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:39,739
offensive side of things if you go to

491
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:41,419
someone say you have to do this change

492
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:42,889
if you have to fix this vulnerability

493
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:44,149
that's taking away from the things

494
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:45,918
they're probably incentivized to do you

495
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:48,709
like that uptime like adding new

496
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,970
features so tell them a compelling story

497
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,159
about why it's important security

498
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,590
consideration make sure that you're not

499
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,849
just dogmatically following well this

500
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,949
vulnerability of scanner says it's

501
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:59,960
important look at it in the context so

502
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,629
you can say this is how a attacker would

503
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,309
realistically exploit things make it

504
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:06,349
understandable to them on how it's going

505
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:08,149
to affect their ability to do other

506
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:09,619
things because they may have to drop

507
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:12,018
everything and write an emergency patch

508
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:14,418
if you get exploited or if assistant

509
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:16,970
does get compromised that system may be

510
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:19,220
off for a week or two in the worst case

511
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,450
if they have to pull it down do a lot of

512
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,700
friends analysis if you get how the

513
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,279
attacker got it rather than simply

514
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:28,639
saying as a security practitioner you

515
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,889
have to do this make it a compelling

516
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:32,809
story with that collaboration back and

517
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:34,519
forth with them at the same time if

518
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,019
you're on the defensive side if someone

519
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,479
comes and says you have to fix things if

520
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:40,999
you have a valid up reason why that you

521
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:43,399
can't fix it right away let them know

522
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:45,529
rather than just saying no if we can

523
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:48,728
increase the dialogue back and forth we

524
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:48,729
can increase security for everyone

525
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,849
so a lot of the commenter's in D&D start

526
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,919
in the tavern one thing I've got a lot

527
00:20:55,849 --> 00:21:00,590
of mileage out of in my career is I'll

528
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,869
have lunches with different groups this

529
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:05,478
doesn't necessarily doesn't work so well

530
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:06,918
with distributed groups but I know

531
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:09,950
people especially in the current days

532
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,960
they're actually doing casual lunch

533
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,389
meetings I resumed and talked about non

534
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,830
work things if you meet with other

535
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:17,899
people who do other aspects of security

536
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:19,609
than what you do you'll start to learn

537
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:21,080
more about the industry you learn what

538
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:24,619
about what motivates them what their

539
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,999
problems are and I'll have you know

540
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,049
reach a few people who do things like

541
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,789
accounting just so I can better

542
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:30,499
understand what are the problems they

543
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:34,009
deal with what do they care about what

544
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:35,330
motivates them and building a

545
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:37,549
professional rapport by doing this sort

546
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,559
of thing also helps when you go and say

547
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:40,629
okay I really need you to stop what

548
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:42,010
you're doing because

549
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,200
some important security thing that you

550
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,850
may not understand the importance of but

551
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,090
if you have that personal experience

552
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,250
working back and forth a casual personal

553
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,449
experience working back and forth

554
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,910
talking about friends family the sort of

555
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,400
things that you care about casually that

556
00:21:54,910 --> 00:22:01,270
can leave them to taking you more

557
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:04,120
seriously professionally you can recruit

558
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,680
new members in D&D so as you find that

559
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,629
you want more players in the game we're

560
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,010
different players drop out you may go

561
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,660
looking for friends to come and join the

562
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:14,170
campaign there are the group that you're

563
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,880
playing with if you work at reach out to

564
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,590
these other people and other aspects of

565
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,350
the company you can get those good

566
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:23,980
working relationships it gives you more

567
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,389
eyes the sock alone can't find every

568
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,920
problem because there may not be there's

569
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,780
contact specific things with um blogs

570
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,180
they may not even realize a security

571
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,920
event there's been times that we've had

572
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,530
people who are developers or an

573
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,560
operational general operations say hey I

574
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,420
notice anomalous thing that doesn't seem

575
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,639
quite right in brought in the security

576
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,860
groups and digging in we're able to

577
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,980
recognize that it was an incident and it

578
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,270
was happening but if we didn't have

579
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,680
those boots on the ground of the people

580
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,960
that weren't supposed to be doing sucked

581
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,150
or analysts psychic work we wouldn't

582
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,940
have ever known about it it also gives

583
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,770
you domain knowledge about risks I work

584
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,300
in big banking so there's a lot of

585
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,860
aspects of things like insurance that I

586
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,399
don't necessarily understand I'm a

587
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:08,199
computer person if I talk with people

588
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,720
that do banking day in and day out and

589
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,640
they can say hey this is how I think a

590
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,080
bad guy could take money out of the bank

591
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,030
they may have ways that I've never

592
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,760
thought about that I can then conduct a

593
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,500
red team experiment and say okay do we

594
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,120
actually have a way to detect this would

595
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,860
this work should we start being

596
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,419
concerned about that building this

597
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,709
interpersonal relationships can give you

598
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:31,160
a lot of information that really helps

599
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:33,800
like that D&D house it counts

600
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,470
multi-class so he might be like I

601
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,149
mentioned I hoes briefly a wizard you

602
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,350
can be a fighter which is just that

603
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,110
generic people with swords that get

604
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,730
around hitting things as we advanced

605
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,350
within the game you can become a little

606
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,690
bit of both so you could be a fighter

607
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,490
wizard and there's a concept that's

608
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,870
pretty popular or increasingly popular

609
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,940
these days called security champions

610
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,290
where you reach out to people within the

611
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,360
different groups they may be developers

612
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,590
they may be operations and you give them

613
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,270
additional training you give them

614
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,360
additional in standardization to focus

615
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:04,520
on security so they are the eyes and

616
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,229
ears within the group both feeding and

617
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,690
information that you need but helping

618
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,760
spread the word about some good security

619
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,470
so in the development group if you give

620
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,750
them the good expensive training on how

621
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,220
to write secure code they can work

622
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,690
during the one-on-one mentoring with

623
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,650
other people on the team but you can't

624
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,780
afford to send everyone to their

625
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,130
training but they can bring that

626
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,350
knowledge back and share it with them so

627
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:26,240
reaching out and greeting these security

628
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:31,070
champions without within the group can

629
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,770
really help a fellow I know through sans

630
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,770
Derek rook had an interesting experience

631
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:37,879
where he started doing lockpick training

632
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,280
that's a way to just kind of reach out

633
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,450
to different people and do something

634
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,330
that was a little bit fun a little bit

635
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,530
security and obviously unrelated to the

636
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,840
day and day security of the company he

637
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,100
was working for at the time but he found

638
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,370
that the people who got really

639
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,020
interested in doing the walk picking

640
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:56,800
also started developing thoughts about

641
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:59,960
how especially with physical security

642
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,340
the company could be reached so he had

643
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,630
good information from people like

644
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,090
administrative assistants who would come

645
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,920
and say hey you know this key badge

646
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,500
system has the following flaws that

647
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,720
someone could exploit it so he bred that

648
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,150
security champions through just kind of

649
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,470
throwing out something fun and

650
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:18,680
non-work-related that helped create the

651
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:23,840
security the boost for security within

652
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:26,270
his company so a buzzword that I used a

653
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,949
lot perhaps too much is purple team as

654
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,930
Curtis has at one point referred to me

655
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,340
as mr. purple and it's the idea of

656
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:35,000
bringing both the red team and the blue

657
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,350
team's together as a single color and to

658
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,050
me this is a big part of the realignment

659
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:42,169
is that there is no separate purple team

660
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:43,610
you know there might be one person in a

661
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,480
large enterprise his job is to do

662
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,459
coordination

663
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,450
but purple teaming is just having the

664
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,270
red and blue teams work together

665
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,550
effectively it's getting together

666
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,560
increasing the effect of the other by

667
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:57,500
working hand in hand rather than working

668
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,060
in opposition to each other and by doing

669
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,490
so you create a feedback loop where you

670
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,530
can more rapidly iterate and find things

671
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,410
and fix them rather than working

672
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:09,440
separately and maybe not having that

673
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:10,790
synergy and the big focus is that rather

674
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,520
than having these goals that might be

675
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:16,070
the one the goals I talked about for red

676
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,850
and blue teams is having goals to

677
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:22,490
increase the security of the

678
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:24,199
organization and I kind of I was worried

679
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,640
about saying people saying to me well

680
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,550
everything you're saying is completely

681
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,160
obvious you know the teams should be

682
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:32,810
working back hand in hand but in

683
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,310
practice and again I'm not just talking

684
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,840
about my employers I'm talking about

685
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,919
gathering information from a lot of

686
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,949
people in a lot of different companies

687
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,600
and a lot of different industries in

688
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,580
practice the two teams don't necessarily

689
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,909
work all of it well together or all that

690
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:51,169
often and why is this important

691
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:55,940
there's a framework that CrowdStrike is

692
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:58,300
pushing the 11060 framework the goal is

693
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,290
that your company or enterprise or

694
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,740
organization should be able to do in one

695
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:04,760
minute detect there's been an intrusion

696
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,620
within ten minutes you should be able to

697
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,930
launch an investigation and within sixty

698
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,310
minutes you should be able to respond

699
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,740
and why do we need this one minute

700
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:17,510
section and wrap it the ability to

701
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:19,100
respond in the 2019 report they did they

702
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,710
analyzed it a number of different apts

703
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,600
and it the worst case with the Russian a

704
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:26,330
PT's they were saying that from the

705
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,490
initial intrusion getting that foothold

706
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,199
there was able to start pivoting around

707
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,630
to other systems on the network within

708
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,310
19 minutes so if you didn't have at

709
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:36,170
least some ability to respond within ten

710
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:39,230
you might have multiple systems

711
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:41,360
compromised with the complexity of large

712
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,860
modern organizations you more or less

713
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,439
have to assume that attackers are going

714
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,479
to get in the phase of imagining that a

715
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,390
firewall is perfect that people aren't

716
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,530
going to click on that malicious file

717
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,380
that people aren't going to reuse

718
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:56,330
passwords you can't count on that the

719
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,470
big important thing is how quickly can

720
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,360
you respond after

721
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,370
initial incident how quickly can you get

722
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,750
it locked down and how can you keep them

723
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:07,250
from hitting once they stare you start

724
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:08,510
moving around interestingly they suggest

725
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,799
that the North Koreans were the second

726
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:14,720
fastest and the Chinese were third

727
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:17,000
fastest that may or may not be true I've

728
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,150
seen some very fast action from Chinese

729
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,880
actors at various points but and

730
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:24,260
CrowdStrike is a service provider that

731
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,419
wants to sell you products and services

732
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,700
so take this with a grain of salt but

733
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:29,900
attackers do start moving around very

734
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:35,120
quickly one stays to get that first

735
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:37,330
foothold a problem that I've seen with

736
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,070
large scale of purple team exercises is

737
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:43,189
if you start just taking a red team

738
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,539
exercise and put the blue team on it and

739
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,250
say okay this is not a purple team

740
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:49,158
exercise it can be really daunting

741
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:52,909
especially when there's a visibly gap

742
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,650
early in the chain if the attackers get

743
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:55,610
in and they're not detected and they

744
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,409
start pivoting around you they're not

745
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,330
detected and they get domain and they're

746
00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:01,700
not detected if you're sitting there's a

747
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,990
blue team it's really easy to say throw

748
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,100
up your hands and say there's too much

749
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,690
to do with them saying that there's

750
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,580
these visibility gaps forever and

751
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,320
nothing gets fixed this whole exercise

752
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,480
is pointless

753
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,178
so to me a key point in trying to fight

754
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,409
this is reducing scope and an excellent

755
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:18,740
way of getting this as they attack

756
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:20,720
matrix it's this is a framework for

757
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,299
analyzing how attackers typically move

758
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,960
to different organizations it's created

759
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:28,460
by my turn it's a ongoing process that's

760
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,549
collaborative between my other number of

761
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,080
different organizations so it's

762
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:35,990
constantly changing constantly updating

763
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,090
that gathers their techniques that

764
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:41,090
attackers use analyzes how they do it in

765
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:43,220
different races and the big attacks it's

766
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:44,959
really nice because it's granular and

767
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,360
then against specific examples of how it

768
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,549
works it's more or less a successor to

769
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,729
the cyber killer chain that Lockheed

770
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:55,480
Martin created it was a good start but

771
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:58,220
didn't give a lot of visibility into

772
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,429
exactly how the tax would be done within

773
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,809
it and also having annoying effective

774
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:04,730
those trademarks so technically if you

775
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:05,960
wanted to the follow of the block that

776
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,350
little trademark symbol every time you

777
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,350
used it

778
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:16,570
so it goes left to right I top to bottom

779
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:19,270
and it examines ways it large or

780
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,310
sophisticated packages typically go

781
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:24,100
through organizations and this that's

782
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:26,770
like not every slowly segments backer

783
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,929
and something is just a script can use

784
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:31,600
guests actually grabbing or having some

785
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:34,090
balls may not do all of these but if you

786
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,280
worried about serious attackers and that

787
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:39,659
kind of thing

788
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:44,530
typically most these done successful

789
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:47,680
intrusion and the first three and the

790
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:50,080
last two are the two key choke points or

791
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,130
choke areas as far as I'm concerned for

792
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,889
making sure that you've got the ability

793
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:56,260
to detect I mean you want to have as

794
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,510
much disability capability and then the

795
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:01,000
technologies but those are the two

796
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:02,740
important things detecting the gotten in

797
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,910
the first place and detecting that

798
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:09,730
they're starting to move your crown

799
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:11,920
jewels on your organization so this is

800
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:14,050
just a small part if I included any kind

801
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,600
of matrix you'd have to squint really

802
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:18,129
really really hard to read all of these

803
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,350
but you can see it it each segment has

804
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:23,190
free some examples so the initial comp

805
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:25,629
eyes might be made right by download

806
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:29,560
after that they might use Apple script

807
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:31,780
to execute additional malware use

808
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:36,610
accessibility features to establish

809
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:37,870
justice mechanism etc etc if this is an

810
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,129
interesting view I definitely recommend

811
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:41,290
going to the website and taking a look

812
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,280
and start to think about what apply is

813
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,830
your organization

814
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,560
many of these examples are specific to

815
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:50,290
Windows if your specific to Mac so you

816
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,429
can go through and say our group doesn't

817
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,440
have to care about this at all because

818
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:57,070
we're in Linux and OS 10 shop

819
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:00,600
exclusively or we only use way to worry

820
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:03,129
about the bash profile type attacks

821
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,540
it'll give you some visibility on how to

822
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,370
start thinking about what attackers are

823
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,290
gonna do and where you checkpoints are

824
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:11,949
where you this little gaps might be and

825
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:13,450
where your mitigation should be so if

826
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,490
you haven't gotten all fired up about

827
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:18,010
attack there's a conference that have

828
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:21,190
done twice now wider hosted it called a

829
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:22,600
cat con it was last fall but they have

830
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:26,110
online archives

831
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,399
both 2019 2018 so if you want to start

832
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,540
exploring how you can start really

833
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:39,490
getting a lot of work with this I

834
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:41,139
recommend checking that out so going

835
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,960
back to the purple team concept what I

836
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,880
recommend is granular tests have the red

837
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,290
and blue teams working together and go

838
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,090
through the attack matrix and figure out

839
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,070
what the likely way that an attacker is

840
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:54,459
going to attack or where a visibility

841
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:56,889
gap might exist and check out just that

842
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:59,110
single place don't spend a lot of time

843
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,460
trying to do an entire simulated attack

844
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:05,199
if you know that you're going to fail

845
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:07,180
pretty early on do the test and then

846
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,890
work together to mitigate that single

847
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:12,190
issue rather than going on and doing an

848
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:13,750
entire campaign make sure that you have

849
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,460
the ability to detect and mitigate on

850
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:19,480
all your network segments especially if

851
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:21,730
your large enterprise and as an extra

852
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,380
extra extra disclaimer I spend most of

853
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:27,370
my time on large enterprises large group

854
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:28,690
so you kind of be enterprising so I'm

855
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:30,310
used to working in an organization has

856
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,750
many subs and affiliates we're actually

857
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,760
going through a giant merger right now

858
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,920
so we're taking two giant networks and

859
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,390
combine them into one so you can't

860
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,340
necessarily assume that just because you

861
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,540
have detention and your core network are

862
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,459
this one part of your network you can

863
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:44,379
detect everywhere so definitely make

864
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,730
sure that all of your key segments

865
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:49,090
network segments has the ability to

866
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,860
detect things and if you don't have the

867
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,740
ability to do that tension work together

868
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,629
and creating that it's that signature if

869
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,360
you're on the defensive side don't just

870
00:33:55,630 --> 00:34:00,790
hand off to the blue team hey you've got

871
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,320
this problem go fix it work with them to

872
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,190
make sure that they can do it so that

873
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,230
they're not spending a lot of time

874
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:13,080
learning the tools that you know but

875
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:16,000
they may not know very well and

876
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,710
PowerPoint has gone wonky please drop in

877
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,790
and let me know if we haven't advanced

878
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,220
to the silence those responsive

879
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,659
reactions and repeatability I'll

880
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:24,509
continue and assume that it's actually

881
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:30,909
working properly for the conference

882
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:35,010
around 50 of 66 just shows the HTTPS

883
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:35,009
mitre org attack on

884
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:50,009
now we're seeing you which is fine okay

885
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:52,000
perfect

886
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:54,910
all right that's actually much better on

887
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,270
the slides so in thinking about the

888
00:34:54,909 --> 00:35:00,240
framework it's about responsive

889
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:03,700
reactions to repeatability

890
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,129
do you like test if it can be detected

891
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,480
is there a playbook for it playbook if

892
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,520
you're not familiar is generally a term

893
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,840
used by the sock that when something

894
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,480
happens when there's a trigger and

895
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:16,230
something's detected exactly what steps

896
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,270
you follow like I was saying earlier you

897
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,710
wet your sock to be highly autumn highly

898
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,570
automated if possible and highly

899
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,580
regimented regimented if you have

900
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:28,930
multiple analysts so that things aren't

901
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:30,430
depending on how one person does it if

902
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,810
there's the playbook work together to

903
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,770
make sure the playbook actually works to

904
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,720
contain the attack

905
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,980
if the playbook was written by someone

906
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,529
who didn't have enough knowledge on how

907
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,700
to stop the attack you may think that

908
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,290
you know how to do it but it doesn't

909
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:44,169
work so make sure that actually does

910
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:47,290
that if it doesn't work work together to

911
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:48,880
revise the playbook and repeat the test

912
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:54,690
or ensure that the controls are solving

913
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:57,340
reputable so a classic example of people

914
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,570
fixing things incorrectly is what I

915
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,880
think of is the one equals one bowler

916
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:03,340
ability where if you're not familiar

917
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,340
sequel injection uses logic errors so

918
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:08,620
you can do things like add 1 equals 1 2

919
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,090
a sequel query and get every piece of

920
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,400
information out of the database rather

921
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:15,280
than the one you're supposed to and

922
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,230
oftentimes you hand a developer hey

923
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,570
here's a kick case where if you use this

924
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:21,820
following string this webform it hands

925
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:24,760
back the entire database and they write

926
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:27,040
a fix that says ok if one equals one is

927
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,150
within the string this thing was

928
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,790
delicious and kill it

929
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:33,460
but if you used two equals 2 or one is

930
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,560
greater than 0 anything that they didn't

931
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:39,930
have that hard-coded fix for it would

932
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,590
still work so as on the offensive side

933
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,569
trust but verify

934
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,220
assume that they did good work but

935
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,570
modify the test enough to make sure that

936
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,700
they didn't make a hard core they test

937
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,430
the hard coded fix that fixes just that

938
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,859
one specific

939
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:57,980
previously to make sure the things the

940
00:36:51,859 --> 00:37:00,259
gap is actually closed so a benefit of

941
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,520
giving this purple team approach there's

942
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,710
a lot of information sharing that will

943
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,829
help both sides have knowledge that can

944
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:08,829
help the other so an example of this is

945
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,849
I've had developers say hey I know that

946
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:20,299
there's a problem with such-and-such

947
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:23,720
library and we've not been able to get

948
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,849
enough points on the agile board this by

949
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,689
the way was not the current company to

950
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:28,430
get it fixed

951
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,960
can you help prove that there's a

952
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:32,470
vulnerability with it so that we can

953
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,790
make sure that it actually gets fixed

954
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:36,319
they cared about the security they cared

955
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:40,099
about the stability stability of the

956
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:40,790
system but they couldn't necessarily get

957
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:42,920
it handled

958
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:45,650
so by coming to me I was able to get it

959
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,000
taken care of had I not been told that

960
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,750
insider information about what library

961
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,339
that they were using

962
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:52,430
I wouldn't necessarily know that that

963
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:53,390
particular type of attack would work it

964
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,308
breaks down the silos

965
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:59,180
it makes the testing were accurate and

966
00:37:55,309 --> 00:38:00,799
gives better control so if someone who

967
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,868
really knows the logs goes through the

968
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:04,069
attack afterwards and says hey this

969
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:05,809
looks like it might have actually worked

970
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:07,579
there's something like buying sequel

971
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:09,500
injection that I might have run and not

972
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:12,349
detected that it works but the logs

973
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,760
would show the developers or the

974
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:17,000
operators can come to me and say that it

975
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,710
would work and I think this cooperation

976
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,720
is important the bad guys have a lot of

977
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,369
time on their side if you're a big

978
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,410
enterprise if you have a lot of money if

979
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:25,160
you're you have intellectual property

980
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,259
that's worth stealing

981
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,819
if disrupting you would be worth a lot

982
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,960
of money and they can block but

983
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:34,790
blackmail you they can spend weeks or

984
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,190
months maybe even a year to figure out

985
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:38,930
how to get into your system your

986
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:41,569
organization has cooperation on its side

987
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:44,169
take as many opportunities to level the

988
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,170
field as you can

989
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:54,100
one way of doing this a fun thing that

990
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:57,310
you can do to start breaking down this

991
00:38:54,100 --> 00:39:00,130
blue is only good aspect it is set up as

992
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,210
a cyber range which I realized sitting

993
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,790
cybers probably know the drinkable

994
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:06,190
offense but let the blue team step

995
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:07,570
outside adjusting the good stuff out so

996
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,650
I've been using this charity tools set

997
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,750
up something outside of your

998
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:13,090
organization so that there's no chances

999
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,790
of things going wrong send about an AWS

1000
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:17,290
or a sure what have you were just a

1001
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:20,590
dedicated virtual lab within your

1002
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:22,240
company where they can use Callie's see

1003
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:25,840
what the alleges tools actually look

1004
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,459
like buttons execute attacks I've seen

1005
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,900
this work really well at developers who

1006
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,180
may not understand exactly what

1007
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,310
cross-site scripting is because you know

1008
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,919
okay so you can pop an alert box seeing

1009
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:38,110
one what's the big deal what's the

1010
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,030
impact of that if you let them play

1011
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:42,520
around and use beef the browser

1012
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:44,580
exploitation framework and see just how

1013
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,930
much you can do with just JavaScript

1014
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,549
that's really eye-opening to them and

1015
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,859
they can start actually being a lot more

1016
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,510
secure because I've had this hands-on

1017
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,030
experience in the cyber Ange seeing what

1018
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,380
the tools do and how they work it also

1019
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:01,660
works with help provide that internal

1020
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:03,040
career path so most people want to move

1021
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:06,279
up most people that wouldn't be sitting

1022
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,529
in a 12 hour sock shift for the rest of

1023
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,510
lines giving them additional tools

1024
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,859
that's something do the better job do

1025
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,960
the job better so they can become a

1026
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:15,400
higher level analyst or moving into

1027
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:20,020
something more expensive and get those

1028
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,790
glamorous positions I've seen a lot of

1029
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,340
value for pairing up people on the

1030
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:26,170
defensive and offensive side and doing

1031
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:30,130
right o bonds where you're sitting side

1032
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:31,750
by side in some cases talking things out

1033
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,250
seeing how the tools work can help

1034
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,440
appreciate and understand the challenges

1035
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:37,420
that both sides have it creates that

1036
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,190
feedback loop where someone can say hey

1037
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,960
I just did such-and-such did you see it

1038
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:43,090
any logs and they can immediately go and

1039
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,670
look and if there's nothing in the logs

1040
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,660
if there's nothing floating to the sim

1041
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,210
you know right then and there you've got

1042
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,290
a problem that needs to be addressed

1043
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:52,119
this helps the red team you can learn

1044
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,440
the playbooks so that you can start

1045
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,030
thinking about how to work around them

1046
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,380
and make sure that those playbooks

1047
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,630
actually do what people think that they

1048
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,980
do the blue team learns the tactics

1049
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,880
techniques and procedures that the

1050
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,380
offensive side is going to do

1051
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,540
and that's not just the red team offense

1052
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,590
aside with real-world attackers and how

1053
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,590
to get detect them

1054
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:21,850
I'll sir may I see from the bottom side

1055
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:25,590
that pepper boy didn't save it so my

1056
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,589
apologies for saying besides are do you

1057
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,069
look for signatures way that you can

1058
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:35,860
make things similar for the development

1059
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:37,660
operation side of things see you can get

1060
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,130
management on board with in providing

1061
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,170
vulnerability remediation as to

1062
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:42,460
performance metric make sure that at the

1063
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,540
end of the day they they're not going to

1064
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,220
get their bonus are they going to get a

1065
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,170
bad review if they don't include the

1066
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,209
mana bility remediation and if they do

1067
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,860
or if they do things like proactively

1068
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:53,470
reach out to you that look at a better

1069
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,240
bonus push applications is testing left

1070
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,580
this is a big buzzword within

1071
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,799
application testing the moment if you

1072
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,960
think of things as left right from the

1073
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,210
development early process to the right

1074
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,330
hand side being the actual release

1075
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,980
candidate running the earlier in the

1076
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:10,990
process you can get things caught the

1077
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:13,540
better in some cases we're integrating

1078
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:17,919
tools into the developers ideas as they

1079
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:19,360
work so that as they write a piece of

1080
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,010
code that's gonna have cycle injection

1081
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,380
right then and there pops ups and says

1082
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:25,390
hey you just did something bad fix it

1083
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:28,150
that's incredibly cheap compared to

1084
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:29,740
having it get into the release cycle and

1085
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,290
having to go back and the developers

1086
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:33,609
forgotten how the code works I have to

1087
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:37,300
switch context and figure out how to

1088
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:40,120
rewrite it to fix the code provide

1089
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:42,310
logging feedback during development so

1090
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,630
if someone of the blue team says we need

1091
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,850
to know what sort of things are

1092
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,720
happening when in our logs fail to

1093
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,100
detect a breach

1094
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,299
if you tell developers they can make

1095
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:53,560
sure that that's actually part of the

1096
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:55,420
log format from the offensive site only

1097
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,850
require remediation of the actual

1098
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,920
serious issues a lot of tools were

1099
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:03,250
running Chernykh generate hundreds dozen

1100
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,530
or thousands of fix of vulnerabilities

1101
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,760
if you dogmatically say that everything

1102
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:08,710
that's ranked as a medium has to be

1103
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,390
fixed they're just not going to get

1104
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,980
things done make sure that you're being

1105
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,450
realistic and get the important things

1106
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,590
addressed but leave enough time for

1107
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:18,790
there other things that they actually

1108
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:21,010
care about try to deliver actual reports

1109
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:23,380
if possible integrate it into their

1110
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:25,930
tracking system if you can put a bug

1111
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,120
into JIRA right then and there there's a

1112
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:30,220
single injection issue that helps

1113
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,470
integrate with their workflow and

1114
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:34,000
that just makes everyone's job easier if

1115
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:35,649
it doesn't have to go cut and paste from

1116
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:43,750
this report by this project manager

1117
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:45,160
through several layers of tools I'm

1118
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,480
going to step aside from the D&D

1119
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,819
metaphor for just a moment to talk about

1120
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:53,440
the Hubble tank which is a concept that

1121
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:55,480
I'm borrowing from that's the

1122
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:59,980
multiplayer online role-playing games to

1123
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:03,460
Mubarak is such as EVE Online EverQuest

1124
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:05,859
and of course World of Warcraft if

1125
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,660
you're not familiar the characters call

1126
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:09,910
it tanks are generally those characters

1127
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:11,319
exist to take lots and lots of damage so

1128
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:16,990
that other elite characters can give a

1129
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:19,630
fun stuff so it's not that they can't be

1130
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:21,759
fun but generally you're not being

1131
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:24,190
getting to the throw was spelled around

1132
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,349
that sort of thing you're upfront you're

1133
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:27,640
getting assaulted left and right and it

1134
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:30,520
was there just soon to be how do you

1135
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,810
having firing off the spells this is the

1136
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,920
lesson I learned by that whole rat

1137
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:35,680
biting incident that I keep mentioning

1138
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,030
for no good reason is that the wizard by

1139
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,660
themselves they founds the security

1140
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:43,330
person standing alone could not succeed

1141
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:44,560
the red team gets the glory he could fly

1142
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:46,540
out of the grammar but at the end of the

1143
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,299
day I can create vulnerabilities and I

1144
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,410
can find risks but I'm not doing the

1145
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:53,170
work that actually gets things done

1146
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:55,629
it's the stock staff who does the actual

1147
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:57,760
detection of if in an actual tech does

1148
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,109
occur and it's the people doing the

1149
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,960
development and operations side you get

1150
00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:03,220
things actually fixed so I'm getting to

1151
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,369
do the fun stuff on the offensive side

1152
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,799
and they're kind of taking and I think

1153
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:09,670
that we don't actually take that

1154
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:14,619
appreciate that quite enough as an

1155
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:16,900
industry so do your best to make them

1156
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:19,480
feel appreciated spend time mentoring

1157
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,730
them explain to them rather than telling

1158
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,000
them if you sit down and say there's

1159
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:27,339
this problem and fix it they may not fix

1160
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,380
it but it doesn't mean that they can

1161
00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:31,240
explain they can explore and find some

1162
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,320
of the things on their own if you go

1163
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,959
through and make sure that they really

1164
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,369
understand what's going on they may spot

1165
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,770
the other things that you missed during

1166
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:40,180
your testing and other parts of the code

1167
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,530
that you just didn't get to or in

1168
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,839
something that used borrowed car that

1169
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:45,529
you're not

1170
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:48,489
of Bush banishment for the training and

1171
00:45:45,529 --> 00:45:50,869
advancement opportunities for them and

1172
00:45:48,489 --> 00:45:52,519
just say thanks like I said thank you a

1173
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:55,069
lot of the thankless work they have

1174
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:56,508
really long shifts typically and there's

1175
00:45:55,069 --> 00:46:00,440
a lot of burnout that I've seen within

1176
00:45:56,509 --> 00:46:09,039
socks so at them and Dave just making

1177
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:12,859
them feel appreciated can pay off so

1178
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:15,049
wrapping up I definitely want to say

1179
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:16,369
thanks to you vet Andy and the other two

1180
00:46:15,049 --> 00:46:19,279
people whose names are on a slide that

1181
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:22,190
got eaten by PowerPoint I know that this

1182
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:24,739
was a big dramatic shift with having to

1183
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:26,119
go to an online format and I'm sure that

1184
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:28,519
there's other volunteers that put a lot

1185
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,529
of work also helping make this happen so

1186
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,609
big thanks to them for bending over

1187
00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:34,130
backwards to make sure that's happening

1188
00:46:31,609 --> 00:46:35,749
rather than just canceling thanks to the

1189
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,069
sponsors especially for making sure that

1190
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:38,959
there was funding to continue to do

1191
00:46:37,069 --> 00:46:41,180
things that the organizers didn't eat

1192
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,920
and it costs I know that it was probably

1193
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,989
temptation to back out so I definitely

1194
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,150
she ate that thanks to all the other

1195
00:46:44,989 --> 00:46:49,789
speakers who made sure that they could

1196
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:51,680
do the online presentations and trying

1197
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:58,249
to persevere in the faces the bursaries

1198
00:46:51,680 --> 00:47:00,950
and thanks everyone who attended so if

1199
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:02,899
you take aways explore what behaviors

1200
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:06,439
your company incentive buzzes both where

1201
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:08,029
you came in others try to figure out how

1202
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,890
to rely on those bad incentives if you

1203
00:47:08,029 --> 00:47:11,029
can and if you can't curse like do it

1204
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:13,430
make sure that you're talking to the

1205
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:14,989
Antron saying hey we're seeing this

1206
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:18,618
problem and I think it's because the

1207
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:20,569
developers of the operations team are

1208
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:23,059
not made to appreciate and send advice

1209
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:24,349
to care about it so here's why we should

1210
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:28,819
get senior management on board with

1211
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:29,930
changing that as a practitioner say to

1212
00:47:28,819 --> 00:47:31,729
yourself when you're doing something

1213
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,649
does this actually result in better

1214
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:34,819
security there's some things that you

1215
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,650
just have to do particularly within

1216
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:38,329
regulated environments where the

1217
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:40,039
auditors say you must do something and

1218
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:42,469
whether or not increases security

1219
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:45,140
you do it but for things that you have

1220
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:46,609
freedom of choice over choose the things

1221
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:50,150
that will have big impact rather than

1222
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:52,160
things that just say okay I did a test

1223
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:54,109
and I found 20 different serious

1224
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,649
vulnerabilities and I may even fix them

1225
00:47:54,109 --> 00:47:57,180
all

1226
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:58,619
break down the silos share that

1227
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,269
information back and forth so it's a

1228
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,579
collaboration between the red and blue

1229
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:05,399
teams rather than working in opposition

1230
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:06,749
to each other and definitely as much as

1231
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:14,849
you can take care of those people on the

1232
00:48:06,749 --> 00:48:20,129
front line I know that we're gonna move

1233
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:21,989
the questions to slack yeah we there's

1234
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,910
lots of comments and questions about

1235
00:48:21,989 --> 00:48:25,799
your presentation I think you had some

1236
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:28,890
really very cool key points that people

1237
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:32,549
really latched onto and I know everybody

1238
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:36,180
enjoyed the dandy aspect even though you

1239
00:48:32,549 --> 00:48:40,109
upfront said I don't play that's okay

1240
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,799
I think had great references and we

1241
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:46,739
appreciate it

1242
00:48:40,799 --> 00:48:48,029
so I oh there's a question how do you

1243
00:48:46,739 --> 00:48:50,670
manage the purple team sort of

1244
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:52,890
realignment with external or consulting

1245
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,390
red teams I don't know if you want to

1246
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:57,390
answer that immediately or just jump

1247
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:59,879
into slack if there's time I'm happy to

1248
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:02,038
do a couple of questions live just

1249
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,200
briefly since I have the problems to the

1250
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:06,359
slide deck and I think a couple slides

1251
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,710
got missed entirely I will happily tweet

1252
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:09,390
out a link later if people went to

1253
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:11,670
download the slide deck and their

1254
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:13,589
speaking notes so they can actually see

1255
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:16,499
most of what I talked about with them

1256
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:19,140
speaking notes as well my twitter is

1257
00:49:16,499 --> 00:49:21,509
mostly read-only but accepts the ends so

1258
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:23,900
you're welcome to add me or just drop me

1259
00:49:21,509 --> 00:49:26,549
a line at me I'm Lincoln I'm a and I

1260
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,200
probably stick a link out there as far

1261
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:31,979
as working with the external groups we

1262
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,960
wills we're making a big push to work

1263
00:49:31,979 --> 00:49:35,339
with boutique groups that really want to

1264
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,109
help us increase security rather than

1265
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:39,420
just deliver your compliance check boxes

1266
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:41,578
I'm sure people have had some problems

1267
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:44,069
with if you have been in this field for

1268
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:46,559
a while some consulting companies exist

1269
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:48,058
because they're PCI a QoS a company and

1270
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,460
they're hired by companies that they

1271
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:53,339
just want that check box and they run an

1272
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:56,460
SS can and they may format the report

1273
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:59,038
and call it proper pen test but in

1274
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,660
reality it's just compliance we're

1275
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,309
finding the vendors to deliver quality

1276
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,469
and we're making sure that they're aware

1277
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:07,680
that our goal is actually increased the

1278
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:09,359
security we tell them that we're heavily

1279
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,019
focused on the wider framework and the

1280
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:15,538
cyber killer chain and so as they do

1281
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:17,729
information presenting to frame it in

1282
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:23,249
that context so that we can work it into

1283
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:26,099
our workflows and when possible we will

1284
00:50:23,249 --> 00:50:27,598
have them do on-site work so that we can

1285
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:29,670
have the people working on the company

1286
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,869
side by side with them we're working in

1287
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:34,069
close collaboration with them rather

1288
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:34,069
than remote pain testing

1289
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,170
all right I don't know if it just makes

1290
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,970
more sense for you to either look at

1291
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:45,470
slack or if you just want to go into

1292
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:48,049
slack and just start answering the

1293
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:50,959
questions I'm directly lots of good

1294
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:52,670
feedback on your presentation so we

1295
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,710
truly appreciate it

1296
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:59,230
and with that we appreciate your time

1297
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:03,170
and your attention and your cool slides

1298
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:06,280
so with that I'm going to turn it over

1299
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:09,560
to the other

1300
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:11,030
Bayside's organizers I'm gonna mute you

1301
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:14,920
do and appreciate your time and

1302
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:14,920
attention thank you so much thanks
