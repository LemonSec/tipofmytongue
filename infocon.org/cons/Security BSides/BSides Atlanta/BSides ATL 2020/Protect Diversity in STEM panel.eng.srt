our other panelists today have done very

74
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:24,659

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:38,819
nutshell that's it's kind of a good

80

before that is just different fields

98
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,219

105
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:53,989
the near the beginning of the program I

106
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:56,799
work for Splunk you might have heard of

107
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:59,748
us as a principal security architect and

108
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,689
prior to that I was a senior security

109
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:04,449
consultant and basically we go out and

110
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:07,580
help our customers with the software

111
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:09,379
prior to that I have worked in a sock as

112
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,688
this acute security analyst and a

113
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:14,209
security architect and briefly managed

114
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:18,619
the sock before transitioning over to

115
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:21,019
Splunk I really enjoy the field I've

116
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:23,689
learned a ton over this time I think you

117
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:25,849
get more from the experience but I got a

118
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:28,490
great start at Kennesaw State just like

119
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:31,459
the rest of our panelists so I'm looking

120
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:33,610
forward to getting into the conversation

121
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,610
today

122
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,900
all right well welcome to all of our

123
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,640
panelists we are super grateful for your

124
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,210
time particularly on a Saturday morning

125
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,849
but you know it's it's it's it's an

126
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,010
interesting environment to do a panel

127
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,230
but there's some great things about it

128
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,740
as well I know I for one I'm wearing my

129
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,710
slippers

130
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:59,590
we know that Marcus is that I'm excuse

131
00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:01,180
me that's a good thing and let me say

132
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,669
this on that note we're obviously doing

133
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,090
a virtual conference and what do we rely

134
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:10,120
or being you know online we are right

135
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:12,159
now this is a casual conversation and

136
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,900
when I say that certainly the topic that

137
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,490
we're talking about today our serious

138
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,820
conversation is there you know somewhat

139
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,080
heavy but I think that the path forward

140
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,060
and most of the things that we want to

141
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,469
do female have open and honest

142
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,090
conversation so that's what we're going

143
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,740
to do you know if you're in your home's

144
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,770
I'm sure we all are you never coming

145
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,060
licensed and enjoy this conversation

146
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,590
openly we're going to laugh about

147
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,160
serious stuff

148
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:39,609
and just have a great conversation so

149
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,840
with that said I'm going to ask our

150
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,730
panelists are going to respond to those

151
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,890
questions and I'm going to go in the

152
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,540
order that I see them on my screen that

153
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,310
makes it easier everybody knows when

154
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,170
they mute and unmute right so every

155
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:55,330
question sort of started with Kelly

156
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:58,150
moved to Carla and then to Marquis is

157
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,359
what does diversity mean to you just

158
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:04,719
generally speaking what does it mean

159
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,940
sure so for me diversity is just the

160
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,340
background experience in life it's

161
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,160
different cultures it's different

162
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,560
genders ethnicities and it is that life

163
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,520
experience that you bring to the table

164
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,120
wherever you are so diversity is that

165
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,969
unique perspective when I think about

166
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,350
diversity I think about what a person

167
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:32,010
has lived through what they've

168
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:36,330
experienced what they know and look for

169
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:39,250
broadening my own perspective and my

170
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:43,890
viewpoint on on just about everything

171
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,890
diversity brings knowledge to the table

172
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:51,609
so for me diversity is mostly the same

173
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:56,920
it's different gender racist preferences

174
00:07:51,610 --> 00:08:00,230
education backgrounds its what people's

175
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:03,920
past and present personal and

176
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:07,010
professional experience what they have

177
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,840
and it brings different perspective

178
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:12,860
touches table and I mean studies have

179
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,989
shown that 87 percent of the best

180
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:20,060
decisions made by team is through a

181
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:23,810
diverse team so you know I I believe

182
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,220
that diversity is exactly what I said

183
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,300
it's just different things that you're

184
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,719
able to bring different thought

185
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:34,130
processes

186
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:36,349
so for me I don't know how many of you

187
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,059
like to travel I love to travel and I've

188
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,010
been fortunate enough to have seen many

189
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,809
different parts of the world and one of

190
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,948
the most eye-opening things for me is

191
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:46,369
when I go somewhere I've never been

192
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:49,639
before and meet people outside of the

193
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,740
United States how different they are and

194
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,639
it's not in a good or a bad way it's

195
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,620
just different right and you your mind

196
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,600
opens up to many more possibilities many

197
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,029
more ways of thinking about different

198
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,940
things different ways of solving the

199
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:08,569
same problems for example I live in

200
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:11,360
Atlanta and traffic here it is less than

201
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:13,399
desirable right and I got to see how

202
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,510
public transit works in other countries

203
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,380
great so diversity is about that

204
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:21,769
representation and getting those

205
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,569
additional ideas to me essentially you

206
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,690
just don't know what you don't know and

207
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:29,300
you want to allowed everyone to to bring

208
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,709
their perspectives in to your business

209
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,990
or in to the challenge that you're

210
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:35,680
working on etc that's what the diversity

211
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,680
really means to me

212
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,290
excellent I love all of that such great

213
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:43,790
perspectives on what diversity is in

214
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,959
general now we're going to drill down a

215
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,610
little bit more into information

216
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,279
insecurities you all are working in

217
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:52,690
various areas of information security

218
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:57,889
what iversity issues are unique to

219
00:09:52,690 --> 00:10:01,009
information what diversity in is apart

220
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:03,310
from our conversation about diversity in

221
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:03,310
general

222
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:12,529
that that's that's difficult question

223
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:15,260
it is so diversity equity and inclusion

224
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:19,699
within cybersecurity or information

225
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:22,790
security I don't think is that much

226
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:25,550
different from diversity equity and

227
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:29,569
inclusion in overall workforce I would

228
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:31,870
have to say that within information

229
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:34,310
security itself it's a field that has

230
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,440
really just bubbled up

231
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,388
I still feel it as one that's fairly in

232
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,010
its infancy and we have a lot of IT

233
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:43,220
professionals that just kind of got

234
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:45,260
thrown into this so when you're talking

235
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:50,410
about viewpoints and perspectives and

236
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:53,630
background it's been and I want to the

237
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,939
caveat this boxing it's definitely

238
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:59,240
changing and expanding right now but I

239
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:02,630
think it's been fairly won minded for a

240
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,220
very long time and so now that

241
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,860
information security of being a little

242
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,620
bit more well defined it's got a

243
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,389
spotlight on it we have more people

244
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,449
coming in with their backgrounds and

245
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:17,329
experiences information security right

246
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:18,469
now I think it's blossoming and we're

247
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:21,380
starting to think about things

248
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,940
differently we're starting to look at

249
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:27,260
the same old problems that we've been

250
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:30,319
having in iterative fashion and actually

251
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,480
bringing some new ideas to the table so

252
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:35,060
diversity equity and inclusion and

253
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,040
information security I think it's very

254
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,550
much like it is everywhere else but

255
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,519
there needs to be a focus on really

256
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:46,010
bringing in those people from diverse

257
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,500
backgrounds whatever it is if you have a

258
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,149
Bachelor of Arts degree in literature

259
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,690
there's something that you can bring to

260
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,459
the table

261
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:58,220
you know it does not matter your

262
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:59,888
background what you know you know it

263
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,240
really it really is about bringing

264
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:08,079
bringing it to the table here within

265
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,079
InfoSec I'm gonna pass it on Carla

266
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:16,610
now it's a wonderful explanation and I

267
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:19,640
agree it has been a problem for a long

268
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:23,600
time however due to the fact that we are

269
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:26,180
now more representative and the media

270
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,830
has definitely put a spotlight on us and

271
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,170
more people are hearing about it we have

272
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,000
a lot more conferences and you know our

273
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,469
graduates are spreading the word our

274
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,690
professionals have spread the word more

275
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,760
we're able to recruit more people I

276
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,380
personally have spoken about my field

277
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,840
plenty of my friends and now they're in

278
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:46,640
the same program trying to continue to

279
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,740
I'm trying to continue to bring in more

280
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,770
women and definitely a lot more

281
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,800
minorities in and I and they all come

282
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:57,800
from different backgrounds you know

283
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,660
accounting and medico and they're they

284
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,180
have all been doing so great in this so

285
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,980
and I think is due to the fact that we

286
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,079
all have a different mindset different

287
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:11,630
thought process understanding of things

288
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:14,450
and that hopefully will continue with

289
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:18,050
you know each of our next set of

290
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:20,480
graduates I know that personally with my

291
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:26,270
experience in InfoSec knowledge sharing

292
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:28,250
and the constant need and once that

293
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,620
everyone has been to pull in more people

294
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:34,070
into cybersecurity has been very large

295
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:37,010
within my own network so I can say that

296
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:39,290
the problem is there we still have an

297
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,930
issue with diversity I in my team

298
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,670
there's probably only three women and in

299
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,089
my past job I was probably the only

300
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:49,339
woman you know working on the team and I

301
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,740
was probably the only Asian person

302
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:55,580
working on the team but now you know

303
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,290
family and and I'm I'm happier I'm

304
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,890
definitely happier to see that it has

305
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:03,740
changed so hopefully as time continues

306
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,390
to pass as with every field that we've

307
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,250
seen it will continue to grow there

308
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,140
there will be more women in managerial

309
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:15,620
position there will be more minorities

310
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:19,580
as well yeah I totally agree with what

311
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:22,440
everything both of you just said and for

312
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:26,280
me what it really means is Wow

313
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,320
is an edge as we all know the

314
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,589
information security fill is incredibly

315
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,690
complex there are a ton of different

316
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:36,060
directions you can go within this

317
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,280
discipline and it's hard to navigate

318
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,800
that right and the other thing we have

319
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:46,230
which I think we'll talk about later is

320
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,849
a huge deficit in talent great for for

321
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,500
feeling these open positions I don't

322
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,180
think you're gonna be able to ask anyone

323
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,210
and say that there's not enough jobs

324
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,819
available right but for some reason even

325
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:58,260
in that scenario

326
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:01,350
diversity and inclusion and equality are

327
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,150
challenges right and why is that you

328
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,350
know so you it's a it's a hard question

329
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:08,550
they ask and I think some of your major

330
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,810
companies and even some of your smaller

331
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,599
businesses are starting to ask that

332
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:15,469
question and take steps to address it

333
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,200
but in information security I think it's

334
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:22,080
even more of a challenge because of how

335
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,630
complex the field is how people perceive

336
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,940
the industry whether or not they feel

337
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,980
like they've got enough technical

338
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,990
expertise and skills to even dive in and

339
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,930
I think the other thing that needs to be

340
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,790
said that's that's specific to InfoSec

341
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,489
is it takes a certain amount of courage

342
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,969
no matter who you are to get into this

343
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:43,710
field and dive in and spend the extra

344
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,260
nights and weekends studying for these

345
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:50,130
certs and things like that and you know

346
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:52,020
that plus the challenge of DNI might

347
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,260
discourage some people from even getting

348
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,900
involved right so so the implications

349
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:01,170
for our industry I think are a little

350
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,329
bit more stark than others even though I

351
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:08,040
think it's a universal problem there are

352
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:10,200
some specifics to InfoSec that need to

353
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,120
be addressed and are in in many ways

354
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,290
being addressed but we're we've still

355
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,290
got a long way to go for sure

356
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:24,480
all right thank you that is a perfect

357
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:24,480
segue to my next question which is so

358
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:40,770
and what I hear from them is that people

359
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:43,900
don't necessarily understand what

360
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,210
information security is and so there's

361
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,939
either stereotypes or misconceptions are

362
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:51,100
just misinformation and so my question

363
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,960
to you all is does that contribute to

364
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,240
this lack of diversity is there less

365
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,600
diversity because people don't

366
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,000
understand what the field is and that of

367
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,890
course might impact the air thought

368
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,880
processes in terms of whether they can

369
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,879
enter the field

370
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:13,750
so yes marquees I loved what you just

371
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:16,089
said and I really want to say I'm so

372
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:21,099
jealous of where you are recording this

373
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:22,448
from it looks like paradise yeah people

374
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,969
don't understand what information

375
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:26,559
security is I've been doing this for two

376
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,569
years now and I have a degree that

377
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,320
specialized in it and I'm still trying

378
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:34,149
to figure it out I went when I was first

379
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,149
getting into the industry this was back

380
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:41,890
when I was in school to a conference

381
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:44,320
that was held by fortune 100 company

382
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,960
very large conference and it was women

383
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,740
and cybersecurity and they spent about

384
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,330
an hour to two hours not defining what

385
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:57,130
information security was but defining

386
00:17:52,330 --> 00:18:00,820
what it was not it is challenging to to

387
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:05,260
understand what InfoSec is and for those

388
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:08,620
of us that did not get into a stem

389
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:11,470
background from earlier early on it's

390
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:14,590
it's I don't know if I'd go so far to

391
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:18,010
say a scary thing to try to step into

392
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:20,350
this but it's definitely challenging I

393
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:26,169
came from a background of waiting tables

394
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:28,840
and loading bags on airplanes and but my

395
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:31,029
personal background I went through a

396
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,549
divorce and I became a single mom and I

397
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:36,730
realized that I had to support myself

398
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:38,408
from my son and information security was

399
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,480
one of those fields where it was job

400
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:43,570
security we have a deficit you'll get

401
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,390
paid and so I just don't head first into

402
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:49,360
it with zero tech background whatsoever

403
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,460
and I didn't understand what it was at

404
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,379
all and I have really flourished because

405
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,120
it's more than just technology I think

406
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,850
more than anything it's a people problem

407
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,879
and when you have those customer

408
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:03,428
experience skills and background and

409
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,159
that knowledge said that's what was

410
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:08,649
really allowed me to flourish in my role

411
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:12,580
it's about communication and business to

412
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:14,379
tech translations and so we want to

413
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:18,610
think about the lack of understanding of

414
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,220
what InfoSec is and then people here so

415
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,840
have a secure

416
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,240
and they see different numbers and the

417
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,870
digital lines across the screen and the

418
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,510
movies don't have open I think that

419
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,939
definitely contributes to the diversity

420
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:35,870
because you have people in different

421
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:38,720
backgrounds that that only step into it

422
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,370
because of past perceptions there needs

423
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,549
to be a light shined on what it is and

424
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:48,709
that's challenging to define Karla

425
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:57,980
not gonna lie more keys I was wondering

426
00:19:48,710 --> 00:20:01,279
if that was really sorry but back to the

427
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,200
topic well I do believe that the lack of

428
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:07,009
understand reduces our pool of our

429
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:11,389
potential talent and just like Kelly I

430
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:13,220
was in so many different builds I was in

431
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:15,619
cosmetology for a while to support

432
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,929
myself through college I you know during

433
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:20,779
college I had my third kid in the middle

434
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:22,940
of one of our hardest classes this

435
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:26,450
professor greens class building got

436
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:29,450
things everyone don't remember is his

437
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:32,629
class so it was definitely and I

438
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:35,090
remember I just had my baby and finished

439
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:37,519
labor and I and then I went straight to

440
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,470
his finest Wow in the hospital it's one

441
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,269
of those things that one of those

442
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,970
moments when I realized how much I

443
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:47,029
enjoyed this field even though I came in

444
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:49,249
with zero background technology I done

445
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:50,720
everything else just like other people

446
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,489
I've been in the dental field I've

447
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,749
worked in a warehouse for a little bit

448
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:55,789
just because my parents said I wasn't

449
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:58,460
allowed to when I was younger I did

450
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:01,340
everything I could just because I didn't

451
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:04,129
have that experience and to be honest I

452
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,840
kind of stumbled upon InfoSec I was

453
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:09,230
going for accounting my accounting

454
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,359
degree here and I decided I didn't want

455
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:15,019
to do it anymore that wasn't where I was

456
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:17,840
happy and I moved over to InfoSec and

457
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:20,470
assurance degree and I fell in love it's

458
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,928
one of those things where you just you

459
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:27,169
just understand that yeah this is this

460
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:31,340
is where my skill set is going to really

461
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:33,169
help and and to be honest I think I was

462
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,389
like everyone else where I thought well

463
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:37,759
maybe it's more IT troubleshooting and

464
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:40,668
it's at programming is it hacking and

465
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,739
cybersecurity is just so unique everyone

466
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:44,570
with regardless what skillset you had

467
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:46,279
there's customer service here they need

468
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,899
some programmers they need people who

469
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:51,320
could stand things up to troubleshoot

470
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:53,239
they need the engineers everyone I ain't

471
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,529
have met so far has came from a

472
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,440
different background

473
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:58,970
I cannot say one person that I've met so

474
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,020
far has Kay

475
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:08,240
has grown up doing information security

476
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:09,889
they but I will say that because of so

477
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,570
many people's lack of understanding a

478
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,160
lot of my friends were hesitant I mean

479
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,050
to this day I am still wondering if I'm

480
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,330
smart enough to be in this field and

481
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:19,540
that's just something that I've been

482
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:23,090
told that you know you just continue to

483
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:26,210
make it to make it and I've done that

484
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:28,790
for quite a lot so hopefully I'm making

485
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,370
it right now but I'm gonna pass it's

486
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:34,730
March ease I think you absolutely are

487
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:38,540
making it and I want to congratulate you

488
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:42,710
on meeting your first person who grew up

489
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:44,800
learning information security right so

490
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,510
my path was a little bit more direct I

491
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,850
actually knew in high school that I was

492
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,400
getting into cyber security and and

493
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:55,730
that's what I did so and but I will say

494
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,770
though to your point that's rare I don't

495
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:01,550
think I've ever met anyone else who can

496
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:03,650
say that so that that that decision in

497
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:06,310
that process and and ending up on the

498
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:09,820
path that I did for me was my objective

499
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:12,169
but that is absolutely very very rare

500
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:14,689
the the other thing I'll point out

501
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:17,300
though is since everyone typically comes

502
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,920
into information security from some

503
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:23,480
other background or from some other

504
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:25,610
industry there is a challenge in in

505
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,790
being being motivated and staying

506
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:31,610
motivated to see it through I know a lot

507
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:37,090
a lot of people start the process and

508
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:39,740
then fall out of it and I the the DNI

509
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:42,500
aspect of it I think contributes to that

510
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:46,130
to be honest with you you you do feel

511
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:49,610
discouraged when you you don't feel like

512
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:52,010
you have an ally or or just someone to

513
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,870
pick up the phone you know how useful it

514
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,150
is to be able to have someone to call

515
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,879
and just say hey can you give me a

516
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,200
couple pointers on XYZ you know or if

517
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,080
you're if you're going into a new

518
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,000
situation and you you want to make sure

519
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,210
you're fully prepared and it's just nice

520
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,640
to have a friend available right and I

521
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,950
it's a challenge especially in this

522
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,740
industry to have

523
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:20,000
because of that that challenge we have

524
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:24,920
with D and I so the other point I really

525
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,600
wanted to dive in on is the the the lack

526
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,240
of understanding of the field itself

527
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,790
contributes to this and there's so many

528
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,530
different areas there's the the the red

529
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,570
team the blue team they're the

530
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,100
compliance side and all the things that

531
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,110
come along with that there's whether or

532
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:43,820
not you want to be a penetration tester

533
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:45,110
or working a saw or and and I've I've

534
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,730
had this conversation with several

535
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,760
people that are breaking into the field

536
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:53,059
everyone wants to do the poll sexy you

537
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,490
know command line breaking into stuff

538
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:57,530
Metasploit all of that and they don't

539
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:59,690
really realize that you can't just start

540
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,970
there there's a whole lot more you need

541
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:07,070
to learn about operating systems and

542
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:09,950
networks and process and I loved when I

543
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:13,030
was working on the osep how there's a

544
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:15,230
focus on reporting and writing the

545
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,850
reports and all that stuff which people

546
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,070
hate right but you're not going to be

547
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,469
successful if you're not good at that

548
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:24,168
so so there are things that come up

549
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:27,130
along the way that I think can be

550
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:30,169
stumbling blocks and it's just up to us

551
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,390
that the people who have been doing it

552
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:34,850
for a little while to lend a hand

553
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:39,429
when necessary I think that's going to

554
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,428
help drive the industry forward

555
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:47,300
okay great great stuff

556
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,470
alright so real quick I want to make

557
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,270
sure we have time to ask a few more

558
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,450
questions but real quick I have to ask

559
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:55,639
you what your favorite stereotype or

560
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:57,170
misconception is about information

561
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,090
security or people that work in

562
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,050
information security and and though

563
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,750
you've heard them and you may be

564
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:04,639
preaching to the choir with the with the

565
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:07,010
audience today but I would love to know

566
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:12,770
what your favorite one is / least

567
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:14,720
favorite of course so I have I have two

568
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,490
one is just my favorite I'm not going to

569
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,780
dive into and then I'm second one that I

570
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:21,320
can actually talk about but for the

571
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:28,000
first one my favorite stereotype is this

572
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:28,000
we think we all know this one the hacker

573
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:35,240
yeah but the second stereotype that is a

574
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,640
little bit more meaningful to me is the

575
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:43,090
one that information security

576
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:46,430
professionals know and do it all is that

577
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:49,760
misconception that we are experts in

578
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:51,380
everything I think really leads to a lot

579
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,840
of security professionals Corning you

580
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:57,950
know very quickly because we just get

581
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,389
drug through the mud I can't really

582
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,460
relate that back to diversity and

583
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:04,880
inclusion because the entire security

584
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,530
field probably feels that pain and

585
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,510
that's certainly one thing that I have

586
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:12,170
struggled with but it is another thing

587
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:16,700
that is contributed to my my consumption

588
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:19,670
of learning one thing that we can do to

589
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:22,010
overcome that misconception is really

590
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:23,600
again just kind of shine the light on on

591
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:27,020
what InfoSec is and what the

592
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,230
professionals really do and so for me

593
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:32,540
just the kind of jack-of-all-trades is

594
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:36,920
is that's that's big when I struggle

595
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:38,570
with this in this industry crying yeah

596
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,300
my favorite starett's how it really has

597
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:44,510
to be with everyone think you were

598
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:46,610
hackers I don't know what that's about I

599
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,110
clearly don't have the skill set to

600
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:52,490
hacker creating with system at this

601
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:54,530
moment at this moment but I mean every

602
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,840
time I explain my role it seems like

603
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,850
just like I've

604
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,279
friend's house their their internet went

605
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,730
down there like hey Carla can you fix

606
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:04,210
that

607
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:07,240
like no does it look like I troubleshoot

608
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:10,450
stuff so they it's always like that

609
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,659
either I am a troubleshooter or I'm a

610
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:15,700
hacker and I'm neither one of those I am

611
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,289
NOT someone who understands the

612
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,289
difference between Star Wars and Star

613
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:21,789
Trek don't hate me for that guys I get

614
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:25,330
it don't hate me I hear that enough at

615
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:27,010
work but I mean I'm not the one who's

616
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:30,779
going to spin up F Society or anything

617
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:33,640
either so please stop assuming baggage

618
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:35,200
but I mean I think the one thing we can

619
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,390
do is actually just keep talking about

620
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,429
it continue to tell our friends talk

621
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,669
about it and that's that's the same way

622
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:45,429
that we've gotten through many many

623
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:47,529
misconceptions of a lot of topics and

624
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:49,840
the more people talk about it the more

625
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:52,809
we're promoting and the more we're doing

626
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:57,279
things like these conferences it's gonna

627
00:28:52,809 --> 00:29:00,970
really help yeah I would I would say

628
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:04,179
that my favorite one is definitely the

629
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:07,240
the hacker and the hoodie in his

630
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:09,370
basement all night with the matrix going

631
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:14,289
on with all the screens right that's

632
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:16,899
literally how how things look and yeah

633
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:19,480
thank you Hollywood for for pushing that

634
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:20,350
perception right and it's not like that

635
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,440
at all

636
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:25,719
we all have families we all have other

637
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,720
hobbies outside of computers that we

638
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,059
like to do I find myself just finding

639
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,460
other things just it's kind of step away

640
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:35,168
from it because you cannot do that a

641
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,080
hundred percent of the time and I think

642
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:40,510
the perception is you do which is not

643
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,360
the case at all so yeah that's nice

644
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:45,429
that's my favorite one and just the

645
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,629
other thing that I think is a challenge

646
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:52,600
is when someone asked me more keys what

647
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:55,210
do you do I struggle to answer that

648
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,530
question because I'm you know I don't

649
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,919
want to over distill it into

650
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,720
[Music]

651
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,120
oversimplify it but at the same time it

652
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,000
is a complicated job you know as a

653
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,070
security consultant an architect so and

654
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,700
I could I could say yes I hope people

655
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,639
build our

656
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,980
textures for sim stop software and I

657
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:16,779
know the next question is what kind of

658
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,230
architecture is that like bridges and

659
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:23,590
what is it sim right so it's it's it's

660
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:26,110
it's hard to explain as load I think

661
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:27,908
that's part of the challenge right so I

662
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:31,449
think the both the complexity of the

663
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:33,010
industry and that that misconception

664
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,519
that you see in the media and in

665
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:39,059
Hollywood kind of contributes to how

666
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:42,130
people perceive security professionals

667
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:45,370
can I can I say one more thing on that

668
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,080
with what marques just said I think

669
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,268
there's also the people who just come

670
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,178
into our InfoSec dude we have a

671
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:54,789
misconception to and it's there's only

672
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:57,130
one job we're only doing this and they

673
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:59,529
as you meet more people you start to

674
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,720
understand there's niches within a niche

675
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:04,510
within a niche just like he said he's

676
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,549
doing Splunk and he's doing architecture

677
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,440
with this book and we don't understand

678
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:11,139
that there's so much more that goes in

679
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,840
so whatever you're looking for I'm

680
00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:15,580
almost positive you'll find it but you

681
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,010
just have to meet the right person to

682
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:20,439
guide you to how to get there and so

683
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,779
that you can use your skill sets who

684
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,700
really make a difference and sometimes

685
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:27,580
when people come in they get stuck in a

686
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,740
song they forget that this isn't where

687
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,889
you will be if you're not happy here

688
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:36,490
learn new skills meet new people network

689
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:38,408
I've never heard a better advice is to

690
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:40,330
continue to keep in touch with your

691
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:41,799
networks don't think you're better than

692
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,658
them you're no one is smarter than

693
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:47,950
anyone in this field you can always

694
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:49,930
learn something from someone out there

695
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,290
thank you for staying out that more Kisa

696
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,290
slow

697
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,330
I have to say I'm totally formerly

698
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,010
guilty so when I was married I'm

699
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:01,860
divorced now too but when I was married

700
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:03,930
my husband at the time worked in

701
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:07,110
information technology not even security

702
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:09,630
and I would have various random problem

703
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:12,270
with my computer and I would call him up

704
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,950
and I would be like hey babe but such as

705
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,990
such such as such and he'd be like well

706
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,660
did you google it and I would be highly

707
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,850
offended you know I would be like that's

708
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,430
not supportive

709
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:26,040
[Music]

710
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:27,929
in-house IT department and he's like I

711
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,639
do this it has nothing to do with that

712
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:31,770
google it

713
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,330
as it turns out you can find a lot on

714
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,970
Google you fix a lot of stuff yourself

715
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:39,240
and it's an interesting thing anyway

716
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:44,090
next question for y'all so diversity

717
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,090
initiatives you often hear about the

718
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:53,990
sorry thank you

719
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:58,669
we often hear whatever see initiatives

720
00:32:53,990 --> 00:33:00,620
about the recruiting aspect of it right

721
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:03,590
how do we get more diverse talent into

722
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:06,260
the field but I know from my work and

723
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:07,580
research says that retention is really

724
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,500
critical that's where you really start

725
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,230
to make a difference with diversity

726
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,240
equity and inclusion because as marques

727
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,920
was saying earlier it doesn't do a lot

728
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,450
of good when people are either attracted

729
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:21,290
to the field or even make it into the

730
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:23,870
field and then they leave right so what

731
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,639
can we do to really foster retention how

732
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,969
does retention plan to this what is

733
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:33,280
needed to keep diverse populations those

734
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:38,690
diverse thought processes in the field

735
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:42,770
that's another great question I am all I

736
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:45,860
can say is continued inclusion I think e

737
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:48,700
Y and partly you can probably speak to

738
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:51,560
this too does a great job with helping

739
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:55,600
diversity groups throughout the company

740
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:58,639
and there in most locations and it is

741
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,649
it's just an ongoing connection to

742
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,780
people with some backgrounds from you

743
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,130
that you can kind of just reach out and

744
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:10,279
connect to so there's a women in

745
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:12,830
technology and ey I'm really ashamed to

746
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:16,690
say I'm not a member of it but it is

747
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:20,449
there it's there it's that ongoing

748
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:23,480
inclusion that and you're right there's

749
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:25,759
a lot of effort poured into to

750
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,260
recruiting those those people with

751
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,270
diverse backgrounds but once you get

752
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,640
them into the company a lot of times

753
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:33,860
that this just walks along the way and

754
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,000
then we're just kind of left stranded

755
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:40,790
and to your own devices and in since the

756
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,760
security field is not one that is hugely

757
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:46,389
diverse at the moment you can kind of

758
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,070
feel like you're on an island sometimes

759
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:52,219
and knowing that you have somebody there

760
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:55,490
that has similar experiences that you

761
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:57,139
can reach out to and just connect with I

762
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:00,290
think that would make a big difference

763
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:04,609
in retaining that that diverse group

764
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:06,830
people I mean I agree with you Kelly

765
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:09,230
ey has been wonderful with it I mean

766
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:11,810
even in regards to people with different

767
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,700
religious practices I see you know our

768
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:16,190
teams allowing people to go out at

769
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,560
certain times to practice the hangers

770
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:21,200
and stuff so I will say that I'm so

771
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,610
appreciative of how amazing you are has

772
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,620
been when it comes to diversity and

773
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:29,330
acceptance in inclusion as well but just

774
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:32,990
like we were we were kids and teenagers

775
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:35,000
we tend to we tend to connect with

776
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:38,180
people that we have some similarities

777
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,940
with right and Kelly's right it's you

778
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,980
you should probably you know have some

779
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,920
sort of program that allows people to

780
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:47,360
connect with people with this at least

781
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,970
some sort of similarities member Garcia

782
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,800
background preferences or whatnot and

783
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:53,870
you know we have our own set of problems

784
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,060
that like mark he said we want someone

785
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,680
to talk to I mean I have presidents

786
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,940
viber now and they're like oh I'm so

787
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,080
glad I have someone who's talking about

788
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,840
this because there's no one else but

789
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,090
what about the women who are struggling

790
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,920
or what about you know the men of

791
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:09,170
minorities instead we all have our own

792
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,240
struggles and just because we don't talk

793
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:14,330
about it publicly don't mean that we are

794
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,790
not thinking about it so I agree that we

795
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:18,770
we have to start coming up with better

796
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:21,200
programs trainings and things like that

797
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:24,350
for our people in different connections

798
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,359
and ey it is good at it but other

799
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:28,009
companies definitely need to do the same

800
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,030
thing is coming up with different groups

801
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:34,010
that we can connect within you know a

802
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:36,170
chats and all these extra stuff for us

803
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:39,490
to be able to speak to that men about

804
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:39,490
our stress that things like that

805
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:46,420
yeah so it's all along with that I

806
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:49,690
totally agree

807
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:52,960
companies have an obligation to create

808
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:55,120
those places they'll say spaces for

809
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,770
different individuals who want someone

810
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,870
to talk to I think that's a a really

811
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,960
laid-back way to put it someone to talk

812
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:05,620
to I'm gonna I'm gonna start using that

813
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:09,130
and I to unfortunate to work with an

814
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:11,680
organization that puts an emphasis on

815
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:13,990
bringing your whole self to work and and

816
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,580
not feeling like you have to color or

817
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:20,649
sway yourself in any way and be open and

818
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:24,460
honest about bringing your ideas to

819
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:27,190
accomplish the collective objective and

820
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:30,270
and we do have employee resource groups

821
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:32,860
several actually at this point around

822
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:34,270
particular interests and backgrounds and

823
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,750
I think what's really important about

824
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:41,700
that is to open it up not just to the

825
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:43,390
individuals in that particular group or

826
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,040
representation but just people who are

827
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:49,270
interested in helping as well their

828
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,890
allies is super important and and have

829
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:52,810
those spaces where you can come together

830
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:55,150
and share and collaborate around the

831
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:57,340
issues that matter to you and develop

832
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:00,040
your own outreach and education to help

833
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:02,380
bring more people in I think a good

834
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,770
measure of success is how good is in the

835
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:08,070
ERG at bringing in additional people and

836
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:12,220
growing that membership and a

837
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:14,380
facilitating that cause those efforts I

838
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,959
think are really successful at retaining

839
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,880
talent inside of an organization but

840
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,090
also attracting new talent

841
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,430
so you know being able to say in the

842
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:27,010
recruiting process that we do have an

843
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:28,750
ERG and here's the membership and here

844
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:31,210
all the events and initiatives that we

845
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:34,630
took part in over the last few months

846
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:36,400
that's probably especially for someone

847
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:39,280
like me at least I'll speak for myself a

848
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,890
huge selling point that that exists and

849
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,800
is is important enough to the

850
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:47,500
organization to sponsor both with

851
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,350
leadership representation in the

852
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:52,750
executive staff but also financially

853
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:54,370
great to have special events just for

854
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:57,100
this ERG

855
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:58,150
and so we have black employees and

856
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,390
mentors in swamp

857
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:03,900
we have limited tech or women X now we

858
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:08,500
have Philip in X we have neuro diversity

859
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,120
so it's lots of different and I'm sure

860
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,130
I'm missing like two or three more tits

861
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,410
it's it's becoming pretty pervasive and

862
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:17,040
I think you're gonna see if your company

863
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:19,540
doesn't have this yet it's coming soon

864
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,990
this is not something that's a novel

865
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,640
idea or something that only certain

866
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:26,890
companies are getting involved in I

867
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,960
think this is going to be universal and

868
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,950
that's great and I hope to see more of

869
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,950
it over over time

870
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,270
I do want to say one more quick thing on

871
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:42,950
that I'm gonna be in a white cheerleader

872
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:46,110
for justice if the groups that they have

873
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:49,640
encourage other people to join as well

874
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:52,170
and so they bring everybody in and

875
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:56,009
within the workspace they encourage

876
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:59,610
everybody to just be who you are my lead

877
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:02,930
has a nose ring and got members on my

878
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:06,270
team with tattoos and there's there's no

879
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:08,460
exclusion they just welcomed they

880
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:13,280
welcomed you as you are and they're not

881
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:15,690
trying to botch up into just a packaged

882
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:20,640
person that you can duplicate across the

883
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:24,180
field they really not only recruit and

884
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:27,029
preach diversity they they walk it out

885
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:30,259
and just that's been that's been really

886
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,260
wonderful to experience

887
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:35,220
awesome yeah I know some Eni diversity

888
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,770
folks and they're doing a lot of things

889
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,839
really really well and that's a great

890
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:42,240
thing we all have to model for each

891
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:46,680
other what this should look like and

892
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:50,098
toward that end let's talk a little bit

893
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:53,700
about ally hood and so when I say Ally

894
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:55,619
hood I'm talking about hang on let me

895
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,980
post the question here in the chat I'm

896
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:03,450
talking about advocacy on the part of

897
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:04,830
majority populations right and so most

898
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:07,020
of us even if you are in a minority

899
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:09,170
population are also in my majority

900
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,400
population right so as a for example

901
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:14,720
heterosexual woman I'm in the majority

902
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,609
population with respect to LGBTQ plus

903
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,939
initiatives and issues and so when it

904
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:22,470
comes to ally hood in information

905
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,580
security and before I ask you the

906
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,618
question let me just make sure that

907
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:29,730
everyone in the audience understands

908
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:31,440
what I mean we all want to be I believe

909
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:34,650
I'd like to think we all want to be good

910
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,950
allies and so there's a difference in a

911
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:41,010
quiet Ally and true ally hood right the

912
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:44,819
difference is coming up to you after a

913
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:46,950
meeting and saying gosh Kelly that was

914
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,450
like really messed up what they said to

915
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:51,118
you or how they treated you or the fact

916
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:55,169
that they they they didn't acknowledge

917
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:58,200
your your contribution to the meeting so

918
00:41:55,170 --> 00:42:01,589
that's a crap quiet Ally true ally hood

919
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,990
is an advocacy not just a sympathetic

920
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:05,430
ear but an advocacy right that looks

921
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:07,979
like me standing up in the meeting and

922
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:11,970
going I believe that was Kelly's point

923
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:15,000
right and so it is a an advocacy as

924
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:17,129
opposed to a sympathy kind of situation

925
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,460
so that being said understanding what

926
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:23,130
ally hood is how important is it to

927
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:25,109
diversity equity and inclusion in

928
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,540
general and information security but how

929
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:30,569
is it how important is it to bringing

930
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:33,000
majority populations on board and get

931
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:38,760
them invested in the work that needs to

932
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,869
be done with diversity another really

933
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,859
great question

934
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:47,640
and a really it's a topic that I've not

935
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:49,589
personally thought about a huge amount

936
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,828
until you just said it

937
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:55,859
I experienced this especially in the

938
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:58,769
technology field as a woman people look

939
00:42:55,859 --> 00:43:00,960
at me and they'll just automatically

940
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:04,439
assume either don't know what talking

941
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,559
about or that what I'm saying is invalid

942
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,599
or that I'm making some kind of mistake

943
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:12,299
there's there see but that was

944
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,180
challenging to overcome I have had to

945
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:17,400
prove myself I've had to cook my skill

946
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:20,399
my knowledge face and I've had to be

947
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,970
really assertive and if I had some

948
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,309
really public advocate's from early on

949
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:29,519
that would not have been so challenging

950
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:34,109
for me to earn my place and that's very

951
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:38,008
much what I had to do so yes speak up no

952
00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:40,319
just because we're diverse and we're

953
00:43:38,009 --> 00:43:42,809
from different backgrounds does not mean

954
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,999
that we do not have anything going on

955
00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:45,630
here and we can't bring something to the

956
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:49,019
table

957
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:52,109
and having somebody on my side standing

958
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:54,899
up publicly saying hey listen up

959
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:56,970
yes this is this is right knows what

960
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,730
she's talking about this is a good

961
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:01,109
opinion that would have been nice from

962
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:03,059
the beginning I have it now

963
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:06,390
he's not what I've proved myself and

964
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:09,539
that might be something that everybody

965
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:11,578
experiences so I'm not not male

966
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:14,009
obviously I don't know what that

967
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:16,980
background looks like but for me that

968
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:21,720
that's what I experienced and that might

969
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:23,910
just be an opinion that that I could

970
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,589
chat with other diverse populations and

971
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:27,720
see if it's a valid one or not I don't

972
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:30,119
know I feel like I have to prove myself

973
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:34,019
especially in the technology field and I

974
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:36,539
feel like I'm coming from from under the

975
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:39,649
table I have to get my chair just hit

976
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,650
alongside everybody else

977
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:47,680
yeah I am I guess I'm a minority within

978
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:51,819
a minority I'm an Asian woman within the

979
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:54,279
field and it's definitely a lot harder I

980
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,080
can't speak for anyone else no one

981
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:00,310
else's personal experience world we all

982
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:02,259
have our own stories to tell and it it

983
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:03,730
was it was really hard especially me

984
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,640
coming from a non-technical background

985
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:09,940
so I remember every job I've started

986
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,450
I've had to you know prove that I'm

987
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:15,370
worthy of the spot I would stay an hour

988
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:17,049
or two after work to continue to learn

989
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:20,920
to continue to work go home and continue

990
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:23,890
to train you know I was in and eating

991
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,930
being a mother apparently you know that

992
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:29,500
was a taboo to talk about during

993
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:31,899
interviews and and I said no to that no

994
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,790
you're gonna know I have a child you're

995
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,790
gonna know what benefits I want out of

996
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:39,460
this job and that I feel like being I

997
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:42,130
think that I had to learn how to be so

998
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:45,450
assertive for myself now when I see

999
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:48,160
someone who is you know a little bit

1000
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:50,080
weaker per se just because they don't

1001
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,299
understand why K you could fight for

1002
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,009
yourself I will do it for them now I

1003
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,930
will go to the meetings I will say no

1004
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,460
that was not appropriate you shouldn't

1005
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:59,620
say stuff like that or I would tell them

1006
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:01,450
you know with the person in the room hey

1007
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:03,310
no don't do that that was not an

1008
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:05,350
appropriate joke don't talk about that

1009
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:07,000
you have to understand how sensitive

1010
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:09,130
people are or you have to understand

1011
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,090
what's okay to someone and what's not

1012
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:15,100
you have to know your place and maybe

1013
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:16,960
it's because I have a you know I have

1014
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:20,319
kids now or maybe it's because I grew up

1015
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,570
you know already a minority and I had to

1016
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,980
do this for myself already you know I

1017
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:26,830
didn't actually understand how to be

1018
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:29,620
assertive until I was about 30 and I'm

1019
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:32,049
so happy that I'm able to pass pass

1020
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,330
along my experiences and to help people

1021
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:36,580
and to tell them hey you can do this

1022
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:38,410
don't worry about what people are

1023
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,630
thinking because if they truly care

1024
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:45,040
about you don't understand where you're

1025
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:47,020
coming from and it's I don't I it's

1026
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,640
probably a no not to say this but I

1027
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,520
don't care if you're a CEO and the

1028
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,519
company or not if it's a character that

1029
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,038
you bring to the table is you're at

1030
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,899
in your words so if you're not in a

1031
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:01,919
person then you have very little respect

1032
00:46:57,899 --> 00:47:03,659
for me in general anyway so you so I

1033
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:04,618
will not be afraid to speak my mind

1034
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:06,779
about that

1035
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:10,339
what I think that you did was not

1036
00:47:06,779 --> 00:47:13,349
appropriate you know and I I feel like

1037
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:15,239
that helps bring out a hood and I feel

1038
00:47:13,349 --> 00:47:16,919
that more people should be doing stuff

1039
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:18,719
like that don't be afraid because the

1040
00:47:16,919 --> 00:47:21,299
worst thing that they you're always

1041
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,459
afraid you're gonna lose your job or the

1042
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:25,109
other on the other hand is people would

1043
00:47:23,459 --> 00:47:26,640
gain more respect for you and they will

1044
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:29,069
understand not they can't push you

1045
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,989
around so you know it's one of those

1046
00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:32,788
gamble that you have to take and I feel

1047
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:34,679
better about myself even if I was fired

1048
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:36,749
for speaking up at least I did it for

1049
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:37,829
something good and plus it's security

1050
00:47:36,749 --> 00:47:44,488
why not

1051
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:46,140
we have jobs so yeah my perspective on

1052
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:48,299
this is a little different and I really

1053
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:51,089
want to break it down and talk to you

1054
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:53,279
about unconscious bias something that I

1055
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:55,229
had to educate myself on and it really

1056
00:47:53,279 --> 00:47:58,349
makes sense and so you never heard that

1057
00:47:55,229 --> 00:48:01,109
term before I encourage you to take a

1058
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:03,329
look into it but let's assume that we're

1059
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:05,669
at KSU Center right now and we're in a

1060
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:07,949
room or we're about to enter a room in

1061
00:48:05,669 --> 00:48:10,529
the conference with hundreds of people

1062
00:48:07,949 --> 00:48:12,569
in it and you walk in in your little

1063
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:15,630
late and you're looking around and

1064
00:48:12,569 --> 00:48:17,099
there's only a few seats available and

1065
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:19,949
you don't really know anybody in the

1066
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:24,779
conference room so you're choosing where

1067
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:27,539
to sit and you see someone who you don't

1068
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:28,889
know if you know them or not maybe you

1069
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:30,419
want to school this person maybe a

1070
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:32,669
little like they're from your company

1071
00:48:30,419 --> 00:48:35,848
and so you choose to sit there as

1072
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:37,589
opposed to anywhere else right there's a

1073
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:40,139
little bit of bias and why you made the

1074
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:42,299
decision and we all have that right but

1075
00:48:40,139 --> 00:48:44,899
you need to understand that because we

1076
00:48:42,299 --> 00:48:47,459
all have that certain decisions are made

1077
00:48:44,899 --> 00:48:51,769
for better or worse right and it's no

1078
00:48:47,459 --> 00:48:54,209
one's fault it's human nature right and

1079
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:56,459
we I'm gonna go back to what I said

1080
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:58,288
earlier we all want someone to talk to

1081
00:48:56,459 --> 00:49:00,058
we want to have a sense of belonging we

1082
00:48:58,289 --> 00:49:02,249
want to be able to lean on someone

1083
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:04,889
especially with something as complex as

1084
00:49:02,249 --> 00:49:07,730
this industry it's nice to have someone

1085
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:13,680
to advocate for you

1086
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:15,750
to give you a leg up or a shoulder to

1087
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,899
cry on or additional information and

1088
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:20,670
mitts for you and once you realize that

1089
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,550
it made you feel a little bit better

1090
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:26,520
about sitting in that location in the in

1091
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:28,500
the conference room or in the conference

1092
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,530
hall wherever you happen to be realize

1093
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:34,050
that if you offer that same sort of

1094
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:34,980
support to someone who's friendly and it

1095
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:37,560
makes you feel a little bit more

1096
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:39,080
comfortable that goes a long way you can

1097
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:43,200
have that same feeling in other

1098
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:46,799
scenarios as well so our ally good and

1099
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:50,460
our having an ally in in the workplace

1100
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,110
is is critical and I gotta say you know

1101
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,600
Kelly's experience and Carla's

1102
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:58,260
experience is it's very common even

1103
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:01,259
today right where they do not have Pai

1104
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:03,990
also had the same problem as well and we

1105
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:07,080
all had to on our own kind of pull

1106
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:10,200
ourselves up and be assertive and prove

1107
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:14,490
that we deserve to be in the room and

1108
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:16,950
prove that we had that knowledge and an

1109
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:19,319
expertise and we could yearly here and

1110
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:21,750
then that kind of respect kind of comes

1111
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,520
along with it and I'm you know when

1112
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,200
you're just getting started it's really

1113
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,100
difficult to do that and it would be

1114
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:32,910
nice to see more universally people step

1115
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:35,850
out and be an advocate and an ally now I

1116
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:37,859
don't want to discount the fact that it

1117
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:39,569
happens every day that people are

1118
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,570
stepping out and doing that but we

1119
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:45,870
definitely have more work to do and that

1120
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:50,040
respect and the other thing I'll add

1121
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:52,980
real quick is you may never know how

1122
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:55,470
much of a positive impact you have by

1123
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,670
doing that you could literally change

1124
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,740
someone's life

1125
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:01,670
by speaking up in that conference room

1126
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:05,310
or offering a set of links to go study

1127
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:07,590
or or handing someone that old CSCS is

1128
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:09,360
people you know to took a look at and

1129
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:11,010
study through or answering their

1130
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,170
questions about things they get tripped

1131
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:15,120
up on in programming there's all kinds

1132
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:19,560
of different ways that maybe small and

1133
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,700
insignificant to you but makes the world

1134
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:24,509
of difference to that in

1135
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:26,250
visual I you know what Marquis I agree

1136
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:29,369
with you and I will say to this day I

1137
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:31,200
still try to think the people at each of

1138
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:34,349
my job that have touched me in different

1139
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,810
ways that that have made an influence

1140
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:38,820
and that I've considered a mentor and I

1141
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,450
remember bringing that up to someone I

1142
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,700
work with

1143
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:44,669
just last week and they said I don't

1144
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:46,950
remember that but you know thanks but

1145
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:49,710
yet every little bit of fee that you do

1146
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:52,109
for someone touches them and they coat

1147
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:54,810
it in and it makes them continue to grow

1148
00:51:52,109 --> 00:52:00,660
so you impact somebody all of your

1149
00:51:54,810 --> 00:52:02,670
actions impact someone I really I wanted

1150
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:08,069
to agree with that too

1151
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:12,810
for me my mentors in this field have

1152
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:17,099
both been men I shall create them and it

1153
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:21,150
I think it was their encouragement and

1154
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:22,800
their lack of bias that we're gonna gave

1155
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:26,190
me the courage to just dive headfirst

1156
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:28,680
into this and in one of those is one of

1157
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:30,420
the organizers Andy green and I just

1158
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,950
want to give a shout out to him he gets

1159
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:37,200
a lot of crap especially people they've

1160
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:41,390
got their glasses but he's he's a big

1161
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:43,919
supporter of diversity and inclusion and

1162
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:50,220
made a big difference for me when I

1163
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:51,000
first got into this absolutely and I can

1164
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:54,359
attest to that

1165
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,280
as well so we are at time and I just

1166
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:58,440
want to thank the panelists for being

1167
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,240
with us here today I want to thank the

1168
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,770
organizers of the event and of course

1169
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,649
all of our sponsors this has been a

1170
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:06,420
truly excellent conversation if you have

1171
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:09,540
questions we're gonna head over to slack

1172
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:11,910
the panelists and myself to address

1173
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:14,579
those questions in that venue but for

1174
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:16,740
now we will sign off with our thanks for

1175
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:18,920
your attendance today take care

1176
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,919
everybody
