1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:09,010
you know once again we would not be

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:12,969
where we are today with the the

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,870
involvement and sponsorship dollars that

4
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:17,890
came in from these fine organizations

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:19,779
and so we want to thank them again and

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,250
so for those of you who have been in

7
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:23,230
this track all day sorry you're got

00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,779
you're going to continue to see this but

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,900
it's important for us to to acknowledge

10
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:32,198
the sponsors who really did stick with

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:35,260
us today as we transition from a

12
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,670
physical to a virtual event so starting

13
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,660

opportunities that they offered

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,619
yesterday and I also want to acknowledge

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,780
a secure code warrior for coming in and

33
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:33,759
offering to run an online CTF birthday

34
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,640
which is actually ongoing in its own

35
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,200
track additionally we would like to

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,409
thank the following individuals and

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,890
organizations or making contributions to

38
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:47,439
our raffle prize effort Mike Kosta and

gray in offensive security and pentester

41
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:58,030
lab and so with that I will stop yapping

42
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,790
and I will now introduce our next

43
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:04,000
speaker from this piece of paper coming

44
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:06,520
up next is Bart Leonard's and he's gonna

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,820
talk with us about crypto agility and

46
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,609
how to respond quickly to cyber security

47
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,769
of that so give me a minute here to stop

48
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,880
sharing my screen

49
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:21,340
and Bart the the floor is yours

50
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:26,070
awesome excellent thank you so much any

51
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:28,540
battery awesome job on the B side steam

52
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:33,070
for organizing the weight is organized

53
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,870
the way it's incredible job well thank

54
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,370
you very much it has been the these last

55
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,450
two weeks have been the longest year of

56
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,610
my life but we are we're glad to have

57
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,290
been able to pull it off and we can't

58
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,540
thank our sponsors enough when we can't

59
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,850
thank our speakers enough so yeah we

60
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,100
appreciate the kind words thank you okay

61
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,760
thanks again I think it's an example for

62
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:58,150
many many other organizations all right

63
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:02,470
so I have I'm gonna take about 25

64
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:06,550
minutes to talk about crypto agility and

65
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:09,820
it's actually a very interesting the way

66
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,440
this presentation gets into the sequence

67
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:15,160
is very interesting because we just

68
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,650
talked about detecting and the great

69
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,350
demo that was shown around detecting and

70
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,420
investigating but what do you do next

71
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,040
let's say you find something how do you

72
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,619
react what how are you going to track

73
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,220
and how quickly can you react and so

74
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:32,830
crypto agility is really about that

75
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,720
quick responding to cyber security

76
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,370
balance but a specific type of cyber

77
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,470
security evidence and that's what we're

78
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,020
going to talk about so we're going to

79
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,370
talk about those crypto events actually

80
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,470
that could happen in your environment

81
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,060
good morning everyone again my name is

82
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,120
Bart Leonard's I'm product marketing

83
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,670
management identified I've been active

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,550
in the security industry for the last I

85
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:58,780
would say 15 years mostly on the tech

86
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:02,310
side since I'd and more recently on the

87
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:06,340
excess encryption side all right so

88
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,560
before we're going to jump in to the

89
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,709
deep technical stuff I want to introduce

90
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,420
a France or actually a foe it's not a

91
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:18,280
friend on earth but someone that most of

92
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:21,719
us know in the name of cameras cameras

93
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:26,770
also Carabosse called in greek mythology

94
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:31,220
is actually was actually the

95
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:34,719
hounds of Hades and what was special

96
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:39,410
about him that this guy was actually

97
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,900
watching the underground or the

98
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,680
underworld to prevent that from leaving

99
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:49,580
and actually cameras as we know it sort

100
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,710
of the authentication is sort of a

101
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,880
mechanism to keep everyone inside and

102
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,760
that was actually what this guy was

103
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,050
doing it was keeping the debt inside

104
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,670
keeping them inside the underworld but

105
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,920
the reason we're going to talk about him

106
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,560
now is about something else and that

107
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,010
this this guy was not a normal guy this

108
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,370
guy had three hats right and all of

109
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,450
those hats could attack him and

110
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,530
potentially at the same moment and

111
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:21,440
that's what we see often in an incident

112
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:24,289
in a security incident it's not just one

113
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,750
thing but often it's a combination of

114
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:31,820
things it's a combination of a human

115
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:33,350
error or an exposure or vulnerability so

116
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,630
it's a combination of multiple things

117
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:42,200
and so when we talk now about crypto

118
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:44,270
crypto has crypto can be attacked by

119
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,849
cameras in many many ways and that's

120
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,919
what we're going to talk about because

121
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:52,490
let me now introduce how we get into and

122
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:55,780
cryptography and encryption is that the

123
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:59,020
world as we know today is a

124
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:02,150
hyper-connected world right it's like

125
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,890
millions trillions maybe of devices that

126
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,859
have been interacted and well have we

127
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:10,820
done reasonably well we introduced well

128
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,070
recently I would say 10 15 years ago all

129
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:17,150
these connections they enable from

130
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:19,370
financial institutions to critical

131
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,659
infrastructure to manufacturers around

132
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:26,120
the world to IT services whatever and

133
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:28,220
because it's all originally well sort of

134
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,380
mostly unencrypted we add an encryption

135
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,490
to this so that the connect the

136
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,740
communication is secure cannot be looked

137
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,370
at it's protected the information is

138
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,680
protected actually also the product

139
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,370
all that has been used for this that we

140
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,760
know most is of course ssl/tls an

141
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:51,610
encryption protocol that is using public

142
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,820
private key encryption technology

143
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:59,770
basically the originator of the data

144
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:02,320
holds a private key and then sends only

145
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,389
certain part out the public part that

146
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,930
then has been used for decrypting the

147
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,850
entire channel right so again when we

148
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,090
talk about encryption we talk about

149
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,880
those keys public private keys but let's

150
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,190
go back to our friends or friends

151
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,740
cameras because what can happen now is

152
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,530
that one of those hats is actually

153
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:26,039
sometimes human error because what do

154
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:29,739
have what can happen sometimes is that

155
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:31,870
the certificates let's say source of a

156
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,510
key right its certificate is nothing

157
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,750
else as someone saying that you are who

158
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:40,630
you are and here is an attestation of it

159
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,760
and here is no certificate I mean that

160
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:45,580
certificate is a key that you can use

161
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,409
for setting up your public private one

162
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,359
or actually your private one and then

163
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,599
other than to extract your public one

164
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,120
that key has a lifetime that certificate

165
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:58,030
has a lifetime and it's very somewhere

166
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,979
between 30 days to maybe a year

167
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,750
depending where you use it on type of

168
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,370
certificate you're using it and which

169
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,860
specific environment you're going to use

170
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,710
it but what can happen is that

171
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,229
certificate that can expire and when it

172
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,530
expires what is gonna happen now is that

173
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:17,710
one of those services is no longer being

174
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:21,059
able to encrypt the data and so now that

175
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:25,719
services that service may shut down and

176
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,610
so now what is happening is that we set

177
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,520
up all these different services up these

178
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,140
connections the encryption decryption is

179
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,458
no longer working and certainly we get

180
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:38,679
huge outage that can take very big

181
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:41,049
implications very big proportions and so

182
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,958
one of them was actually I think a year

183
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:47,829
and a half ago which was the o2 outage

184
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:52,900
which was a service provider telco in

185
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:55,660
the UK and when the o2 mobile net

186
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:58,000
failure or the o2 Network went down it

187
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,240
was because of an expired software

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,550
certificate and it impacted not just an

189
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,710
individual service anymore but impact a

190
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,930
total of 30 million people which was

191
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:11,230
quite a lot actually and that's one of

192
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,819
the biggest instances that I have seen

193
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,980
it I have witness of the last couple of

194
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,490
years there was one more recently maybe

195
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:22,360
you remember Microsoft team that went

196
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:24,550
out I think in February I think it was

197
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,420
the beginning of every Microsoft team

198
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,030
stand down

199
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,770
why because certificate went down and

200
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,270
now there was a certain stream of

201
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,939
connections there's no longer to be able

202
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:36,160
to build that all right so that's one

203
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,670
risk that's one of those hats that can

204
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:44,709
come to you and attack the cryptographic

205
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:47,699
world another threat is now especially

206
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:50,710
around the libraries but even more about

207
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,870
what I would call the specific libraries

208
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,450
that could be impacted each library each

209
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,540
software library has vulnerabilities

210
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:01,420
right and there may be bugs inside there

211
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:04,660
and those bugs could be exploited and

212
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,969
wanted exploit it and someone finds a

213
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,920
way to get in now what can happen is

214
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,440
that someone could create a certificate

215
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,140
or could good not just a certificate

216
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,250
could create a message actually and

217
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:20,170
start exploiting this and an example

218
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:25,030
that we have seen there which is

219
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:26,979
somewhat related is the Equifax issue

220
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:30,510
what what happened with Equifax is that

221
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:34,090
just as any other software software

222
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,430
specific instance at Equifax I'd had a

223
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:40,150
vulnerability so an attacker was

224
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:42,910
scanning the map they found the Equifax

225
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:45,490
server there was a specific server which

226
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:48,160
was around the resolution which was

227
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:52,300
about dispute resolution a specific

228
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,510
server and attacks were able to exploit

229
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:58,839
the Apache over there they were able to

230
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,910
go deeper go to the database started

231
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,640
extracting the data and how did they

232
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:06,040
extract it where they extracted it over

233
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,709
an SSL TLS

234
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,349
over an encrypted channel actually and

235
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:13,839
so although the problem was initially

236
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:20,199
there right because that got exploited

237
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:22,060
they went on for 76 days because the IT

238
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:26,319
team the security team in that moment

239
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:28,089
was not able to detect it because the

240
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:32,019
extraction was happening over an

241
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:33,459
encrypted Channel and because what the

242
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:36,519
reason behind it actually is was one of

243
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:38,349
those certificates expired and the

244
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,399
certificates required to inspect the

245
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,160
traffic expired

246
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,310
or wasn't refreshed and there was no way

247
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,610
to inspect the traffic but you can see

248
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:50,739
it's now the gun is almost turned

249
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,050
against you so yes there's a

250
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,230
vulnerability but then using the

251
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:59,410
encryption against you as a weapon now

252
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:02,709
to go undetected is sort of the third

253
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:07,110
the second hat that that animal that I

254
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:10,089
was just showing terrorists was can can

255
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:13,600
point to you and then there's a third

256
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:15,069
one which is of course about the

257
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,319
algorithms we talked a little bit about

258
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:19,620
that and how each algorithm can have

259
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,880
probabilities but what if those

260
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:27,760
algorithms encryption algorithms are

261
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:30,699
also being exposed and being compromised

262
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,800
now is that I would say at the CA level

263
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:36,790
so what is a CA does anyone know about

264
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,199
usually I use I ask questions this time

265
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,260
it's gonna be a little bit harder but

266
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:45,010
CAS our certificate authorities doors

267
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:47,050
are the instances that will give you a

268
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:52,420
certificate for a certain amount of time

269
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:55,240
well those entities are also not without

270
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,529
any risk and also have been compromised

271
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,319
and we'll give a couple of examples

272
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:02,949
later on and I think it was recently

273
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:04,630
where let's encrypt actually was issuing

274
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:07,810
a statement that there was a certain

275
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,490
amount of certificates that were not

276
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,050
issued in the right way or have a

277
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,950
certain vulnerability or need to be

278
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,189
reissued again

279
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:18,440
it's okay like for me where I'm only

280
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,510
managing one or two websites and I can

281
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,950
reuse it quite again but if you have a

282
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,720
couple of hundreds maybe a couple of

283
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,760
thousands areas where you need to

284
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,100
reassure the reissued those certificates

285
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,740
again it can take quite a lot of time

286
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:35,540
and you need something something bigger

287
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:37,790
for this bottom line here is this is of

288
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:41,029
course what is happening bottom line

289
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:44,180
this is false my intro now ten minutes

290
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:47,870
in the presentation but my person my my

291
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:52,790
intro was is that I'm showing examples

292
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:57,470
of how cryptography can be used against

293
00:13:52,790 --> 00:14:02,360
you and how Kerberos the guy the the

294
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:05,750
hounds actually of the afterworld almost

295
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,370
can look at you and start issuing and

296
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,860
throwing things at you one of them is

297
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:13,459
allergists through human error or human

298
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:16,130
error related to other jiz it can be

299
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:18,469
cryptographic bugs and we'll talk about

300
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,570
it later on and it can be see a

301
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:24,709
compromise or a certificate ology that

302
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:29,240
you're using actually for the encryption

303
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:31,399
and it's somewhat compromised and now

304
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,380
you need to react to this and so what a

305
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,779
script or agility now script agility has

306
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,880
been able to handle those things all

307
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:40,459
right so what I've done now is simply

308
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,160
explain cryptography is great crypto

309
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:44,899
ring is awesome we need it but there are

310
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,899
some gotchas with that you have to

311
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:49,730
prepare for so here's a couple of things

312
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,310
I'm going to talk about this

313
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,519
presentation is usually an hour and I'm

314
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,779
skimming it down to 25 minutes we can

315
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,750
again talk a little bit more about

316
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,579
crypto agility what are other instances

317
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,300
saying about in a couple of examples

318
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:08,300
we're going to talk about specific

319
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:10,099
mitigation risk that you have to take

320
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,500
what is the mitigation how can you

321
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,569
mitigate those risk and then I'm gonna

322
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,940
point out to a couple of resources that

323
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:21,380
you can download and start using so

324
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:24,350
bottom line I use the example of cameras

325
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,180
but actually what is crypto agility

326
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:30,200
crypt agility means

327
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,939
is actually the process of it describes

328
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,180
actually a way to implement encrypt

329
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:38,839
already to ensure that the algorithm can

330
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,430
be replaced quickly without changing the

331
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,709
function of the application all right

332
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,719
that is a description that comes out

333
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,729
directly of a Gardner document so it's

334
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,800
basically about are you able to handle

335
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,380
those without changing your application

336
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,920
and out and doing it very very quickly

337
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:57,470
actually and a prediction that Godin has

338
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,270
said is that next year organizations who

339
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,209
have this will suffer sixty percent

340
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:05,360
fewer related security breaches than

341
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:07,099
those without the plan and I'm gonna get

342
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,260
a link later on where you can download

343
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,260
this document and read more about this

344
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:18,189
but now let's give a couple of very very

345
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:23,149
specific examples recent examples of how

346
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:25,640
crypto agility came to surface and how

347
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:29,630
important it is and how deep it can go

348
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:32,180
sometimes so another example of a

349
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:37,070
specific type of attack that needed now

350
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:39,319
crypto agility so flame malware maybe

351
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:42,920
you've heard about this flame malware

352
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:47,089
also known as flame or sky wiper it's

353
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:49,189
actually a modular malware it was I

354
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:52,640
think discovered already in twenty

355
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:55,880
fourteen or fifteen but it was a very

356
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,400
large program it was a scripting

357
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,279
language actually and what it would do

358
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:04,129
is it would inject code into various

359
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,089
processes very stealthy and what it

360
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,709
would do this it would actually try to

361
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:12,770
compromise it would start breaking

362
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:16,370
different algorithms inside the compute

363
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:18,230
engine and then it increased the

364
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:20,419
computing capabilities and it would

365
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:26,140
start breaking share as Shah actually

366
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:29,240
which is one of those encryption signage

367
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:32,090
capabilities that is used now a very

368
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,580
specific example how it was misused so

369
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:37,760
this is just showing the malware

370
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:41,820
breaking in into or breaking

371
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,790
one actually but what really was

372
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,080
happening is was a following and it's a

373
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,659
true example have happened is that

374
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,389
everyone knows about Windows and how

375
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,570
Microsoft sends out Windows Update

376
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,520
packages right what they do is they

377
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,830
create a package they sign it

378
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,050
the you sign it by using their own route

379
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,210
CA and MIDI you see a signing

380
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:06,899
certificate and so they sign it through

381
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:09,059
a chain of thrust hierarchy or thrust

382
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,820
actually and then they send it out to

383
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:15,110
individual devices right and then you

384
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:18,110
download it and you will install it now

385
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:21,030
guess what what's happening is that

386
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,889
there multiple of these change and one

387
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,649
of those chains was the Terminal

388
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:28,050
Services CA which is especially around

389
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:33,330
the terminal services from at Microsoft

390
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:36,149
and attackers were able to go and to

391
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:39,659
David still using md5 actually and

392
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:42,780
create a fake or a wrong certificate and

393
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:46,290
then they were signing some software

394
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:48,210
bitter thrusts at Windows Update

395
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:50,570
actually and sending this out

396
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:54,500
so they were sort of pivoting off that

397
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:57,120
top hierarchy and then using one of the

398
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,490
key one of the certificates actually to

399
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,000
sign Mel were actually and that's how

400
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:06,600
this another sign of malware got out and

401
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,120
was able to reach out to I think thirty

402
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:13,949
thousand devices in total so bottom line

403
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:16,559
here is that the flame malware actually

404
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,570
exploited this was able to pivot off

405
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,270
take one of those compromised and

406
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:23,939
certificate and then sign malware with

407
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:27,110
this and distributed over out so again a

408
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:31,830
weapon being used against you against us

409
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:33,990
okay another example that I have where

410
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:36,510
specific cryptographic bugs that you may

411
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,390
have heard about it really gotten use I

412
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,370
would say five years ago to heartbleed

413
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:43,890
Infineon Debian was one of them all

414
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,649
examples where there are bugs into

415
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:49,919
cryptographic libraries and they allow

416
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,030
the attacker to get access to the keys

417
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,310
to get access

418
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:59,270
to them break them and death happened

419
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:04,230
and more than likely gonna happen again

420
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:05,639
now a third example actually I'm going a

421
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,570
little bit quicker now a third example

422
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:12,390
is all about CAS

423
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:15,300
being compromised right or certificates

424
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:18,360
from a CA being compromised one that was

425
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,669
very recently was North v p.m. nor DPM

426
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,399
VPN provider and that happened recently

427
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:27,060
out of last year where again one of

428
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,590
those certificates got compromised I

429
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,960
think was a private city that compromise

430
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:34,110
or the wrong one was issued to them and

431
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,020
of course now they use a certificate to

432
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:40,350
encrypting some of the VPN network

433
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:45,510
connection and that led to of course

434
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:48,929
less secure connectivity so bottom line

435
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:50,940
here is what is this different cyber

436
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,250
incident cyber encryption events it

437
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,490
could happen it is about abusing the

438
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,200
trust right it's about making sure it's

439
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,200
malicious activity that violates the

440
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,020
trust between you as a consumer and this

441
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,350
CA that is assuring this and that is a

442
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:10,889
big ones that chain of trust is come all

443
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:15,389
bets are off it's about also hackers

444
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:18,540
trying to use those for specific

445
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:23,160
purposes it's also it could be about

446
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:25,790
business partners right who are maybe or

447
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,380
who have used the wrong certificates and

448
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:31,350
connecting to you and maybe the data is

449
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,330
going through the wrong area it could be

450
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,250
technology malfunction the human errors

451
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,350
that we talked about both on the

452
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:40,140
exploration of the certificates as well

453
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:43,110
as the implementation where you do this

454
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,150
and in a little lack of internal

455
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:48,510
controls actually is that how you're

456
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:52,380
gonna do it is bottom line I'm showing

457
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:55,350
here a set of examples around how

458
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,600
encryption can be used against you and

459
00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:00,179
in need for able to react to this and

460
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,070
that's what the last five minutes I'm

461
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,750
going to talk about what can you do now

462
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,730
not going to tell about specific

463
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,059
products I'm gonna say about what on

464
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,919
outer standards what are the best

465
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:14,889
practices you can do to get prepared for

466
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,230
this and it's actually relatively simple

467
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:20,199
it's actually three things the first

468
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:23,289
thing you need is establishing a very

469
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:27,899
comprehensive inventory right making

470
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:34,269
sure that you have somewhere database

471
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:36,668
that is able to or you set up somewhere

472
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:39,340
a certificate advantage database you

473
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:43,289
discover your network and you stole or

474
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:46,149
you start storing all those certificates

475
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:49,480
in that database the second thing that

476
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:53,110
you have to do is now being able to set

477
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,960
that database between the individual

478
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,508
systems and different CAS where you

479
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:02,230
getting it so sort of a step in the

480
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:04,240
middle actually and basically what you

481
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:07,240
can do is when you discover this and you

482
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,669
can do that agent or agent was based now

483
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,580
you get a clear view you can start

484
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:16,000
building a clear view to an individual

485
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:18,309
it can be the PGI team but it also could

486
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,889
be your info section the InfoSec team

487
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:24,549
who's really in charge of all the

488
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:26,350
individuals and protecting the different

489
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:28,899
businesses and the information inside

490
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:32,408
the business but that individual inside

491
00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:34,899
whether it's the PGI team or the InfoSec

492
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:37,990
team is now able to get the global

493
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:40,590
overview about who are where is actually

494
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:43,720
the pivot is where they are coming from

495
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:46,750
what are the individual devices assets

496
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,000
that I have that that need this and what

497
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,129
are now the specific certificates that I

498
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,110
have in my environment and so this gives

499
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:56,439
you a better overview also around the

500
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:58,209
timing and this inventory can now give

501
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,919
you a little bit of better views so it

502
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,679
can give you overview about the key

503
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,080
lengths is the right key land in place

504
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:09,399
yes is the right key algorithm in place

505
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:12,189
they are all algorithms are they no

506
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:15,549
longer been used right can i outpace

507
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,600
those can I can I replace those deciding

508
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:18,910
algorithms the

509
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:23,649
occasions the owners the time the

510
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:25,120
expiration time any specific regulation

511
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,860
so if you are in the specific

512
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,179
regulations you have specific guidance

513
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,689
around which type of case needs to be

514
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,740
used

515
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:38,650
maybe the reissuing and the rotation

516
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,880
frequency and then last but not meals

517
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:42,760
make sure that you have an overview

518
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,310
about which assets and which

519
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,340
certificates on that assets are being a

520
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:50,139
link to which CAS which are the issuing

521
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,720
certificate authorities that are

522
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,510
providing this so that when something

523
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,840
happens at that CA level you can actu'ly

524
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:01,150
this but the first step is make sure you

525
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,159
have a comprehensive inventory and it's

526
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:05,380
not a one-to-one it's really a

527
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,450
one-to-many can be one too many what I

528
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,490
mean with this is it's an asset it's a

529
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:12,040
certificate and then it's all those

530
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:15,340
different ad attributes that you have to

531
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:18,340
make sure you have a view on all right

532
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:22,149
the second thing that you have to do is

533
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:24,760
establish policies create clear policies

534
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:26,980
and that can really depends on the

535
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,710
environment that you have maybe you need

536
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,750
multiple type of policies do you have to

537
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:33,670
create them by yourself no you don't

538
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:39,670
have to do there is something called

539
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:41,890
NIST 1816 B which describes this very

540
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,380
very well detailed so if you have time i

541
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:48,630
really suggest to take a look at this

542
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:51,700
and it describes like how to establish

543
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:54,310
ssl certificate policies which are the

544
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,530
ones it talks about inventory it will

545
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:59,919
talk about also the service what is sort

546
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:01,930
of the service that you have to deplore

547
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,300
that you have to get installed and

548
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:07,480
people so people can work with and what

549
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,810
Rd now the specific requirement Asian

550
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,850
requirements key length all those things

551
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:15,460
and it's it's very well described around

552
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:19,600
so my suggestion is take a look at this

553
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:21,490
also this section this regulation from

554
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,750
NIST will really talk about crypto

555
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:27,850
agility and it will describe the cable

556
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,430
II on how you need to replace that it

557
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,280
will indicate that you really

558
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:34,590
need that cable to replace large number

559
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:37,070
of certificates and private keys to

560
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,840
resists from things like quantum

561
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,550
computing other things and I think the

562
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,830
current recommendation is being able to

563
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,990
replace all your keys within two days

564
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,699
that's sort of the high level now do you

565
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,440
want to tell your manager well give me

566
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,640
two days to replace those critical

567
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,250
service today

568
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,470
now you don't want to tell us so if you

569
00:26:53,250 --> 00:27:00,150
can do it quicker it's it's it's

570
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:02,490
definitely a bonus on this all right

571
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:05,220
merit was one of those and going a

572
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:08,460
little bit quicker here where they were

573
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,620
not able to do that quickly and the last

574
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,680
thing did I want to talk about because

575
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,770
my time is almost up here is it so there

576
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:19,530
are three things inventory policies

577
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,780
right and apply those policies now

578
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:24,270
against the inventory so you can get the

579
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:28,560
intelligence and the third thing is now

580
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:32,010
be able to automate the management and

581
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:35,850
replacement so basically when you have

582
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:37,620
let's say a self-service where the

583
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:40,860
individual lines of business could

584
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:43,800
request certificates and and you hand

585
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:46,949
those out that you can then not just

586
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,840
hand those out and but you also can

587
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,120
orchestrate the deployments of those

588
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,000
certificates immediately whether it is

589
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,439
provisioning services API that you're

590
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,380
using SSH is another good example where

591
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,840
you want SSH especially today when more

592
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,840
and more IT admins are remote you want

593
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,850
SSH but there's a key part to this again

594
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,250
so how are you gonna manage that be how

595
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,990
that key and how you gonna have manage

596
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:16,620
that key deployment are you gonna make

597
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:18,450
sure that the right private keys are in

598
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:21,689
the right place and that nothing is

599
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:24,470
orphan that I know none of the five keys

600
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:29,420
are gone and left the building or

601
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:33,720
somewhere else anyway so that is now the

602
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:35,550
third part to protect from cyber

603
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,270
incident this specific type of cyber

604
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:41,950
incidents is that you can if necessarily

605
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:46,200
rotate remove

606
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:50,140
the certificates the keys wherever or

607
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,870
issue and rotate them if necessarily as

608
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:56,260
well at high speed all right

609
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:58,060
I went a little bit faster here's

610
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,910
something that I want to highlight if

611
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:03,940
you so we have so I'm working for a

612
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:07,090
company called Vanna Phi but we offer

613
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:09,550
access to a research document that talks

614
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:12,149
about this and you can find the link

615
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:16,450
here it's again about crypto agility and

616
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:19,210
it's we promote it it's not necessarily

617
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:21,820
written about verify it's about Gardner

618
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,520
that that describes the need for this

619
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,770
and how to do this and what the specific

620
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,920
benefits are my suggestion is take a

621
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:32,500
look at this and download it and you're

622
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,090
gonna learn a lot more on the specific

623
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,530
ability there's also a link to our

624
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,879
website where you can find more

625
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:39,250
information if necessary

626
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:44,470
alright I have about two minutes left

627
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:49,690
for questions and I'm gonna open I can

628
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:51,100
maybe open it now yes absolutely if

629
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:56,620
you've got questions post them in the

630
00:29:51,100 --> 00:30:02,169
slack Channel for Bart let's see if I

631
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:03,639
can open my select channel I do see any

632
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,040
questions coming up maybe I'm not

633
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,670
looking at the roads yeah I see what

634
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,790
okay

635
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:11,500
hello West Lambert typing so yeah some

636
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:15,629
nice compliments and some thank you guys

637
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:20,820
a nice job so thank you so much for us

638
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:20,820
cool and thank you so much Andy as well
