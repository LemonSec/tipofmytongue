recognize our sponsors and we put up our

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:18,480
without them as I've said multiple times

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,890
throughout the day without our sponsors

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,619

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,199
possible today so I want to take a few

separate track and I've been kind of

41

virtual global conference for the first

65
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,550
time ever and as a result we are curious

66
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,160
about where you are and so I'm going to

67
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,010
stop sharing that for a minute and so if

68
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,030
you haven't done so already please go

69
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:05,690

75
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,989

77
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:25,380
previously we've been giving away things

78
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,299
all afternoon

79
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,340
joette has been handling that over in

80
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:31,799
this channel and I'm going to put that

81
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,470
in here and just to remind you again

82
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,840

84
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,900

89
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,209
so we need you to punch in real

90
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,269
information real mailing address real

91
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:03,260
email address and a real cell phone

92
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:06,030
number for any of that to happen also

93
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:09,030
we've been having people ask us all day

94
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,130
long hey I missed a talk where can I

95
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,660
find it well we're recording all of them

96
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:18,320
and we have a professional

97
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:21,810
post-production process in place and

98
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,169
once those videos those talks have been

99
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,700
run through post-production we're going

100
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,500
to make them available in our YouTube

101
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,640
channel and so people have been asking

102
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,740
where is the YouTube channel

103
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,380
well it's right

104
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,599
here for you I'm posting it in the

105
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,460
channel we're asking that everybody go

106
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:39,289
out and subscribe to that because I

107
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,448
found out a few minutes ago that once we

108
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:44,750
hit 100 subscribers we get to have a

109
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:48,620
fancy vanity URL so the closer you can

110
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:53,690
help us get to 100 the better off we are

111
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:56,449
and we appreciate that um let's see here

112
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,550
I think that that's about all I've got

113
00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:00,590
so I'm gonna stop yapping grab my piece

114
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,740
of paper and introduce our next two

115
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:07,008
speakers we have with us Jeremy Brooks

116
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,250
and Stuart Lane and they will be talking

117
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:12,680
with us about automated web application

118
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,360
and API discovery and other things that

119
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,770
sounds simple but are actually difficult

120
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,449
and with that I will turn it over to

121
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,270
those two nice to them and I will stop

122
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:25,520
talking good afternoon everyone

123
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,630
thanks for spending some time hanging

124
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,560
out with us

125
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:33,710
my name is Jeremy Brooks I'm a developer

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,430
for the last 20 years that sort of

127
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:41,060
switched over net to app sec and focused

128
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,370
on app sec for probably the last five

129
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,030
plus years working on different things

130
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:51,770
now I'm running a application security

131
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:54,948
program at a Fortune 1000 retailer here

132
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,799
today with co-worker mine Stuart let him

133
00:05:54,949 --> 00:06:00,139
do is everyone yep I'm Stuart Lane I'm

134
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,330
an application security engineer I work

135
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,430
with Jeremy I'm also a student at

136
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,258
Kennesaw State University majoring in

137
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:10,610
information security insurance and

138
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:15,860
graduating this may so let's do well

139
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:17,930
yeah go else so we get right into it so

140
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,139
the challenge that we're presenting is

141
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:25,310
to find and scan every application and

142
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:27,080
API in your organization NIST has

143
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,990
developed five functions which

144
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,050
constitutes a strong cybersecurity

145
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:35,990
program and a lot of people focus on the

146
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,550
protect part but you can only protect

147
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,690
your applications if you know where they

148
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:44,150
are so we focused our efforts on

149
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:46,180
identify which enables us to understand

150
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,090
what type of risk is possible within

151
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:51,710
specific environment in our organization

152
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,390
basically if you don't know about it you

153
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,330
can't assign a risk to it

154
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,820
so we're not going to talk about how to

155
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:01,370
set up best incest that's for another

156
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,349
talk we're specifically talking about

157
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,380
before you go into that stuff how do you

158
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,360
find those applications and the

159
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,340
challenge with this is that absolute

160
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,810
teams don't have a great discovery

161
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,340
process or it's a it's a passive process

162
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,040
there are new there are new apps and

163
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:22,810
Lacey web apps that maybe no one knows

164
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,710
about in M API endpoints they propose a

165
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,920
completely different challenge because

166
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:30,140
they're difficult to find Beryl it's

167
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,180
like go find all your web apps well okay

168
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,520
but how are we going to do that and

169
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:39,230
that's where teams usually fall back

170
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:42,109
into an old-school onboarding model so

171
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:45,170
here's what a typical old onboarding

172
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,660
process looks like that a knapsack team

173
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:50,330
may have Smee set up this is a prime

174
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,910
example of what a waterfall method is in

175
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,789
dev teams just don't do waterfall

176
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,650
anymore if you try to implement this in

177
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,980
an agile development model it would be

178
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,560
perceived as a gate and developers won't

179
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:06,110
follow it and figure out a way to bypass

180
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,520
this process leaving you wondering why

181
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,100
no one is filling out the four they

182
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,530
created and even if you can get a dev

183
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,170
team to do this the data that given to

184
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:18,979
you only works really if it's new

185
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,420
development and that information is also

186
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:26,440
becomes out-of-date as soon as it's

187
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:28,730
handed off to you so our approach

188
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,219
basically how do you you know you still

189
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,630
want to be involved with the dev team so

190
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,610
you want to know what they're working on

191
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,740
and security is still important even in

192
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,510
an agile development process this

193
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,590
requires a mind shift and an

194
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:45,350
understanding of how new software flows

195
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:46,640
on the dev development teams and you

196
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,770
have to have some idea of how to hook

197
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,569
into those different points into the

198
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:55,730
pipeline so we're going from a passive

199
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:58,100
to an active search for applications and

200
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:01,820
then based off the end

201
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,740
that's bill we identify risk factors and

202
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,880
that's specific to our organization that

203
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,110
we're going to talk about later on and

204
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,710
based off of the risk factors in the

205
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:18,200
inventory we track changes and we create

206
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:20,330
alerts based off of those changes yep

207
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,190
that's great so before we dive into the

208
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,160
methodology will kind of give you our

209
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,680
thought process as we were building this

210
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,689
this process out and how we sort of

211
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,839
thought about how we're gonna tackle

212
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,610
this problem and basically we went back

213
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,890
to their steel sea and we thought about

214
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,830
you know what what does it look like in

215
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:43,040
the environment when news when software

216
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:46,010
is being built and being tested and

217
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,310
being deployed what what's going on what

218
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,980
kind of activity so there's repositories

219
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,400
being created there's commits flow into

220
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,710
repositories if it's you know if they're

221
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,930
actually doing an agile or lean you know

222
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,260
there should be a CI CD pipeline so

223
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:05,000
there should be projects being created

224
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,100
there should be DNS entries for these

225
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,390
web apps right I mean they they're gonna

226
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:14,570
have names and URLs that people can

227
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:17,030
visit so there should be DNS records

228
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:20,870
there should be infrastructure being set

229
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:22,670
up and if they have a proper pipeline

230
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,910
they're probably going to have a dev

231
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,890
environment a QA testing environment and

232
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,689
then a production environment so our

233
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,370
thought process was we should go look

234
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,160
for signs of life you know we should go

235
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:38,090
look at sources of truth to figure out

236
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:41,329
where software is and that's kind of the

237
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:44,360
foundational thought behind our behind

238
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:46,520
our pipeline so this is what our

239
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,900
pipeline actually looks like at a very

240
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:53,990
high level we're looking at we're doing

241
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:57,740
DNS enumeration so we're collecting lots

242
00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:00,020
of host names that may be running web

243
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:04,340
applications may not we're doing web

244
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:07,550
host discovery on those we're doing API

245
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,710
discovery which is basically going a

246
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,870
little bit further it's web host

247
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,940
discovery is kind of just checking

248
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,730
see if there's something at common web

249
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:20,089
ports and does it look webby right does

250
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:24,620
it speak HTTP API discovery is looking

251
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:27,589
for REST API then we're doing risk

252
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,540
factor identification and what we're

253
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:32,150
trying to determine there is do we

254
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,819
really care about this application

255
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:37,939
beyond just knowing that it exists you

256
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,770
know we're gonna necessarily scan

257
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,990
everything your new full penetration

258
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,449
test we we need to look and make a

259
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:47,360
determination on how deep do we need to

260
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,670
go and then we're generating alerts on

261
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,460
all this stuff so we're not having to

262
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,800
manually go and constantly look for

263
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:58,760
these things we're getting feedback from

264
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:03,469
the system so we'll look at each piece

265
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:06,319
of this the DNS enumeration it's pretty

266
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:10,310
basic but we're looking at sources of

267
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,310
truth right so the first place to look

268
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,760
is to look at your DNS servers and look

269
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:20,060
at the zones so we have a system that is

270
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,970
trusted by the master DNS server and it

271
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,029
can do zone transfers and that gets us a

272
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,920
lot of Records back and we're

273
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:30,230
specifically looking at a records

274
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,910
quality records and see names and using

275
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:36,680
those to build fully qualified domain

276
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:41,600
names if you're using Azure DNS or AWS

277
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:44,779
is route 53 you can enumerate DNS

278
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,390
through their REST API we're actually

279
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:52,370
using Azure DNS so we just go through

280
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:54,980
all the zones using the azure DNS zone

281
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,320
API and then we pull all the records and

282
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:04,120
we look for those a records and cname

283
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:07,850
records so that gets us the big bulk of

284
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,820
the host names in addition to that we

285
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:15,230
also run some make some tools that look

286
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,600
at external data sources so a mass and

287
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,580
find domain or the two specific tools we

288
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,990
use all the tools I'm going to talk

289
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:25,370
about by the way or open source these

290
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,400
tools give us

291
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:30,980
view of shadow IT so don't know if you

292
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,600
saw the Bishop Fox presentation they

293
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,630
kind of touched on this and we're doing

294
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,990
something kind of similar because you

295
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:42,140
might have found all your DNS records

296
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,800
but there could be some application out

297
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,779
there or some app that somebody stood up

298
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,000
that's still linked to your domain and

299
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:52,640
this is a good these two tools are a

300
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,779
great way to find out where those are

301
00:13:52,640 --> 00:14:00,110
and Adam to your inventory so once we've

302
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:03,040
built that list at this point all we

303
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:06,529
have are host names we don't know what's

304
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,569
running on those we need really in our

305
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:12,529
cinema web applications so we need to go

306
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:14,540
look for the ones that looked webby so

307
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:17,150
you could use nmap or curl or roll your

308
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:22,010
own thing that goes out and hits various

309
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:25,819
ports I came across a tool called HTT

310
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:28,730
probe which is a little go program it's

311
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,040
it's pretty fast and it really gets the

312
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:34,190
job done so it's very nice you just feed

313
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,160
it a list of host names and it spits out

314
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:40,310
a list of web hosts with the port and

315
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,100
scheme attached perfect that's exactly

316
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:45,050
what we need the other thing that you

317
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:50,510
can do so if you're not having good luck

318
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:54,410
with with doing like the convincing your

319
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:57,110
sis admins to allow your server to do

320
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:59,180
zone transfers or you're not figuring

321
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,880
out where to get the axe you know you're

322
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,329
not getting access to your cloud-based

323
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:08,810
DNS system look at your continuous

324
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:11,420
deployment tools because those have to

325
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:14,660
push that application out somewhere and

326
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:17,630
so in the configuration there's going to

327
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,150
be a host name of where that application

328
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,189
lives so that could be a good place to

329
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,959
do we're not at the point of where you

330
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:29,300
feel like we need to do that data mining

331
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:31,160
but it's another place to look so at

332
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,859
this point now we've kind of whittled it

333
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:37,069
down to we've got a big list of web

334
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,139
hosts where we suspect web applications

335
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,119
are running we would

336
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:47,149
also like to know within those

337
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:49,160
applications where are our api's so most

338
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:52,189
developers if they're building new api's

339
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,769
they're probably not using soap so it

340
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:56,149
was kind of cool back in the day because

341
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:57,679
you can trust that there would be a

342
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:01,369
wisdom endpoint which pretty much

343
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:03,259
described every every endpoint for the

344
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:06,109
API so you're once you found the wisdom

345
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:09,579
of Don rest is a little more complicated

346
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:13,579
because it's it's kind of wild wild west

347
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:16,429
there is a new relatively new it's been

348
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:18,888
out for a few years now but fairly

349
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:21,589
widely adopted let's just call it the de

350
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:23,089
facto standard for REST API I'm it

351
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:24,829
started life is swagger

352
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:27,379
some people still client swagger it was

353
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:29,508
rebranded a couple years ago is open API

354
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:31,519
but you'll still use see those terms

355
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:32,989
kind of intermixed if you're not

356
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,749
familiar with it you can go check out

357
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:40,100
the swagger to i/o site but it's

358
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:42,499
basically a way to describe your REST

359
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,720
API in a machine readable way so it'll

360
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:46,809
be either a JSON object or a Gamal

361
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,449
object and that's what we're looking for

362
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:52,429
so our strategy is to take the list of

363
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:55,639
web hosts that we found and go visit

364
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:58,249
some of the common endpoints where we

365
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:03,169
know our developers push out api's and

366
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:07,819
we look for a JSON or gamal document on

367
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:09,260
the other end of that that's that's a

368
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:12,230
pretty good way to do it it's not

369
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,029
bulletproof but if somebody has a better

370
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,220
way I'd like to hear it but that works

371
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:17,539
well in our environment because we know

372
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,949
something so you have to know a little

373
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:20,959
bit about how your developers build

374
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:24,860
their api's you might have a different

375
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,389
list of common locations and one point I

376
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:29,539
don't think we made clear is none of

377
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:30,889
this changes your relationship with the

378
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:33,110
developers by the way you still need to

379
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:36,439
have good communication but this lets

380
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:38,389
you go out and and fish instead of

381
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,649
sitting by waiting for developers to

382
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:45,439
come to you another good place to look

383
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:48,199
if you use in Azure xapi eye Management

384
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,659
Services or AWS API gateway again you

385
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,910
can just go data-mine that and you can

386
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:56,000
just enumerate all of the

387
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:58,310
api's and when developers configure

388
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,430
their api's 300 ease tools through as

389
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,980
your AWS you basically get open API doc

390
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:07,280
for free you just need to go and find

391
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:09,350
all the find all the resources and go

392
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,200
visit the end point that gives you the

393
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:18,139
open API doc and the other cool thing

394
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:21,320
about swagger or open API where is a lot

395
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,960
of tools support it so postman you can

396
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,270
just drop an open API doc in the postman

397
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,910
and it generates a test suite for you

398
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,830
or there's a plugin for burp there's a

399
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,780
plugin for his app a lot of commercial

400
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:40,460
scanners have built-in support where you

401
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:43,360
can just feed them document alright and

402
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:47,330
then finally risk factor identification

403
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,939
so these are the high level risk factors

404
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:54,159
we're looking for these kind of give us

405
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:56,540
a quick view of how deep we want to go

406
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,210
again you might have different risk

407
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,090
factors but these are the ones that we

408
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,580
kind of agreed on internally that are

409
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:07,970
signals of that we need to go deeper so

410
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,470
is that our login page is it using is it

411
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:12,290
configured to use weak TLS which

412
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:16,460
understand that's not an application

413
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:19,430
issue but we found that applications

414
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,290
that are running on a server configured

415
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:24,770
with weak TLS tend to have other

416
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:28,460
problems so it's a signal for us if it

417
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:30,620
supports HTTP with a width and it

418
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:34,490
doesn't redirect to HTTPS so in other

419
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,870
words I can visit HCP website HTTPS

420
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,240
website and basically at the same

421
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,939
content that's a signal that there's a

422
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,450
that there's some risk they're outdated

423
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:47,300
or old sites again with this enumeration

424
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,710
we're probably going to find some legacy

425
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,860
stuff that's not part of the pipeline

426
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,720
that nobody's looking at so we want to

427
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:58,459
be able to identify those kind of legacy

428
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:02,270
older sites and then risky keywords so

429
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:06,260
that's what that's about is going into

430
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,580
the looking at the response or looking

431
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,679
at

432
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:14,120
you're get repositories and looking for

433
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,549
words that you might be specific to your

434
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,439
environment so for our environment we're

435
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,929
really concerned with applications that

436
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,659
touch payments or applications that deal

437
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:27,470
with sensitive PII so we're looking for

438
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:29,360
applications that have keywords that

439
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,059
seem to indicate that they're doing this

440
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,979
and then the last one which we haven't

441
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:36,320
fully cracked yet although I'm super

442
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,590
interested to look deeper into the smog

443
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,809
cloud which Bishop Fox talked about this

444
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:44,449
morning is is it an external versus

445
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:47,000
internal we sort of intuitive based on

446
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:50,269
where we discovered it if we find it

447
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,190
through like a mass or find domain we

448
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:53,809
kind of put it in the external bucket if

449
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,879
we find it through one of our internal

450
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:58,399
DNS servers we put it in an internal

451
00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:00,649
that's not always correct there because

452
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:03,018
we have some things that are internal

453
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:06,439
that still somehow leaked external but

454
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:11,120
it's still a pretty good a pretty good

455
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:14,600
indicator so kind of touched on this

456
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,570
stuff but I baller is is good for

457
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,269
finding login pages or old-looking sites

458
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:22,908
so this is a Bishop Fox tool that they

459
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:25,190
published back in the fall really easy

460
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:28,970
to use just take just use Chrome

461
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:31,190
headless feed it your lit your your list

462
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,679
of web hosts generate the screenshots

463
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,950
feed in iBomber and then let eyeball or

464
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,889
do the classification for you so they've

465
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,659
got like four different classifiers

466
00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:44,600
right now we're just looking at login

467
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:48,740
pages and old-looking sites if you're

468
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:53,658
familiar with SSL labs which is hosted

469
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:57,620
by paws you might like to look at test

470
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:59,419
SSL dot sh it's open source free version

471
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,729
of that that you can run on your own

472
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:06,320
hosts you don't have to worry about you

473
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:07,909
know getting API throttled or you can

474
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,299
you can tune it it really is a Swiss

475
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:13,370
Army knife of TLS checks we kind of we

476
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:18,289
do the the fast version that just looks

477
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:20,299
for critical issues and we report those

478
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:23,029
as risk factors

479
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:25,970
and repository activity cells talking

480
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:28,669
about risky keywords that's what we're

481
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:31,399
looking for those new repositories we

482
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:33,220
actually alert on that because if

483
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:36,590
somebody creates a new repository

484
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:39,409
usually the name of the repository has a

485
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:42,168
good clue of what it does and if nothing

486
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:44,389
else it's a chance to go engage with the

487
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:48,080
developers and say hey we noticed you

488
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:50,959
created a new repo called do super

489
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:54,918
sensitive thing with customer data let's

490
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,620
talk about it and you can also if you're

491
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,929
using an on-prem version you can use a

492
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,239
tool like talisman or get secrets and

493
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:04,490
look for hard-coded secrets we're not

494
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,980
there yet reason bitbucket cloud which

495
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:10,419
doesn't have hooks so we're actually

496
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,860
trying to build something that basically

497
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:14,779
monitors for changes so we can't do the

498
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,959
blocking but we can do the reporting but

499
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:21,409
if you've got an on-prem solution for

500
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,779
repositories you can use one of these so

501
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:26,269
that's that's our full pipeline I see

502
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:28,929
the questions piling up in slack so I'll

503
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:32,240
get to those in just a second

504
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:36,590
what I wanted to talk to you about a

505
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:39,289
little bit was outcomes so we we've been

506
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:42,168
able to successfully implement a lot of

507
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:44,840
this pipeline and so we've we've moved

508
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:47,029
past the passive discovery now we go out

509
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,590
and find stuff we stop developers come

510
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:51,409
to us we still have open lines of

511
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:53,809
communication but we're just as likely

512
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:56,629
to find something new that that they

513
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:58,820
haven't told us about as we are to have

514
00:23:56,629 --> 00:24:00,889
them come by so it gives us a chance to

515
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,658
start the conversation

516
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:05,830
the really big benefit of this is we

517
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:12,259
have a basically continuously up-to-date

518
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:13,668
application inventory we can have you

519
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:15,350
know we're just constantly building this

520
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:17,210
this thing runs all the time it

521
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,949
basically runs and when it's done it

522
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:23,269
just starts up again so it's it just

523
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:25,429
never ends we're able to use those

524
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:28,629
identifiers that I've pointed out as as

525
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:32,480
risk factors so we attach that to the

526
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:33,649
finding and we can say it kind of gives

527
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,140
us a quick

528
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,780
and on on whether we need to go deeper

529
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,300
into the site and we're sending all

530
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,520
these alerts to a slack channel that we

531
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,169
monitor and that our developers can

532
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,980
monitor - so we're getting good

533
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:52,760
visibility on all these things and I'll

534
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:54,890
give you a little teaser so we built

535
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,330
this out with some of those up to source

536
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,490
tools that talked about but we also

537
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,860
wrote some proprietary code because this

538
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,410
is something that you know we built for

539
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,260
our team at work it's it's proprietary

540
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:09,500
to our employer so I can't just post

541
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:12,650
this stuff up to github and say have at

542
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,970
it but I'll show you real quick how we

543
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:17,210
built it and I'll give you some better

544
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,980
news right after this so it's just an

545
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,070
example of one of the slack alerts so

546
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:25,460
here we you know two new API is

547
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:27,710
discovered in Azure two new live web

548
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,710
hosts were discovered and some new

549
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:32,690
bitbucket repositories and we can go

550
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,880
look at each one of those and see you

551
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:38,120
know what the what they look like what

552
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:42,110
the risk factors were we built it out as

553
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:46,340
a REST API so we have our own swagger

554
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:50,719
page and we have just a cron job

555
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:53,120
basically that just runs it on repeat so

556
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,020
like I said the bad news is I can't just

557
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:00,679
take this and post it but what I'm doing

558
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:02,120
right now is I'm gonna build out and it

559
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,330
just starting like this is literally

560
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:09,409
fresh as of this week and I published it

561
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:13,220
up to my github so there is a app set

562
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:14,690
discovery repo in my github and you're

563
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:17,450
welcome to go check it out like I said

564
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:21,800
it's really raw but I do have I have

565
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:24,950
implemented some a significant part of

566
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:27,379
the pipeline and you can if nothing else

567
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,180
use it as a example of how to use some

568
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,730
of those tools but I'm gonna continue

569
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:35,090
building it out it'd be awesome if you

570
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:37,910
want to collaborate on it totally down

571
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,500
with that if you just want to pull it

572
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,540
down and maybe try to use it to

573
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,440
bootstrap something in your organization

574
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,909
that'd be awesome too but that wraps it

575
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,889
up but Stuart did you have anything else

576
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,109
I kind of

577
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:54,859
yes no yeah I mean you know better risk

578
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:57,199
factor identification the the goal you

579
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:58,879
know is to its decide if the site's

580
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,739
working worth taking people look at

581
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:04,189
right so in our organization we have

582
00:27:00,739 --> 00:27:05,749
over two thousand applications so based

583
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,759
on a risk factors we might not we might

584
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,769
engage and we might not but it's good to

585
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:13,309
know it's good to know that these

586
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:15,169
applications exist in general so I mean

587
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:17,119
that's really what we're looking at

588
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:21,739
there but I know it was great I think

589
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:23,149
that it was good Jeremy good all right

590
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:25,009
let has any questions we can insert yeah

591
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:27,918
there's some good questions all right so

592
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:29,570
here's one it says how would you do API

593
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,899
discovery in an environment where

594
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:37,340
documentation is outdated or not even

595
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:39,859
done at all so yeah I mean that this is

596
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:43,220
a good model for that it really what you

597
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:45,228
need to do is look for pattern so even

598
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,679
if you don't know where everything is is

599
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:50,960
if you know where some stuff is you

600
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,299
probably have a pattern that you could

601
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,950
follow so if you're developers aren't

602
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:57,259
sticking their API is under you know a

603
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,389
slash API endpoint they're probably

604
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:01,489
doing something similar if nothing else

605
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:03,199
you can start looking through source

606
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:05,359
code repositories and look for those

607
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,190
patterns and then build those out into

608
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,139
your automation unfortunately there's

609
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,299
not you know there's no magic I mean

610
00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:14,570
api's are tough and it's just because

611
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:16,729
they're not well especially REST API is

612
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,619
because discoverability is a very tricky

613
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:20,179
with them there's there's there's

614
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:22,340
nothing to crawl right it's not like a

615
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:24,679
standard website where you pointed at

616
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,090
the root page and you get back links and

617
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:28,309
forms and stuff that you can then start

618
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:30,019
crawling if you go visit the root page

619
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:33,619
of an API you're just as likely to get a

620
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:36,609
blank pages to anything else but if

621
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:40,279
they're using some standards like

622
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:43,309
swagger or open API you can look for

623
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:49,429
those swagger Doc's or open API Doc's

624
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:52,220
and use that as your documentation if

625
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:53,479
and then you said for web host discovery

626
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,279
would you recommend a network perimeter

627
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:58,460
scan for applications communicating

628
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,379
through firewalls b2b or b2c yeah that

629
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,400
would be a cool that would actually be a

630
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:02,649
really cool feature

631
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,710
I think you're talking about like

632
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:07,550
looking at your firewall logs and seeing

633
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,250
basically you won't you want to build

634
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,540
your own caste be kind of thing right

635
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,430
you could do that I think you'd have to

636
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,840
figure out you know if you use and it's

637
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:17,750
gonna depend on what kind of firewall

638
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:20,750
using but you know like powers I know

639
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,400
they have blogs and you can pull those

640
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,590
out if as long as it's like an

641
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,200
enterprise firewall there's probably an

642
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:31,300
API and there's probably logs that you

643
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:37,190
can pull out and and data mine those for

644
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:38,230
for b2b and b2c communication ok cool so

645
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,700
it looks like we're getting the hook

646
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,440
yeah

647
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,270
I'll answer the rest of the questions in

648
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,630
the slack Channel thanks guys I will

649
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:49,220
post the slides and thanks for your

650
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:51,670
attention and have a great rest of the

651
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,670
conference
