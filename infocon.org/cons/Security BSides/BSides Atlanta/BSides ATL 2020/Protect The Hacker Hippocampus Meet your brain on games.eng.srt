it over to Chloe all right wonderful hi

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,190
everyone my name is Claire Asahi and

31
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,380
today we're gonna talk about your brain

32
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,630
when you're doing games so basically

33
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,210
this is gonna be more geared towards GTS

34
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,520
like betting and whatnot so let's dive

35
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,199
in now the first thing to note about

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,500
this this is my first time doing a

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,130
virtual version of this and this is an

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,320
interactive talk so to kick us off and

39
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,050
get us started make sure you are signed

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,020
in slack because we're gonna be doing

41
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:52,870
activities together I'm going to share

42
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,869
my screen can everyone see my screen

43
00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:01,840
I take that as a yes I'm hoping it's a

44
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,320
yes let's put it that way all right so

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,179
what I want everyone to do right now is

46
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,399
there are gonna be activities throughout

47
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:13,190
this and so basically what's gonna

48
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,040
happen is that I'm keeping tabs of

49
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,530
everyone when they give any answers in

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,980
the slack so make sure you're in track I

51
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,650
I think protect so good track protect

52
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,000
and once you're in there there's gonna

53
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,950
be throughout this thing there's some

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,190
times where I'm gonna ask you questions

55
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,640
now the people who participate will be

56
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:37,130

if you're wondering what escalate is it

67
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,109
basically is what we use for our CTX so

68
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:13,670
you could do from home and so on so

69
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:14,570
let's get started so first my name is

70
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,000

74
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,970
when I'm not doing that

75
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,780
I'm also the founder woman hackers this

76
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,609
is a virtual platform that basically

77
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,489
non-binary and women can connect

78
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:37,070
together and hack at all levels so we

79
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:39,019
have workshops we have basically share

80
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,359
anything about CTS and whatnot so if you

81
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,610
or someone who's out there who feels

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,310
like you want to join gme and let's make

83
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,560
that happen other than that i am an

84
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,359
organizer for the hacker book club so we

85
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,140
are just wrapping up Tara at wheelers

86
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:57,109
book on women in tech and we will be

87
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,390
starting in about two weeks of what

88
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:01,459
Marcus Carey's tribe of hackers so

89
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,619
basically with this book club we read

90
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,440
the books from the hacker community and

91
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,990
the hacker community reads them and

92
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,750
participates so yes we do have

93
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:13,030
the authors do join us for our sessions

94
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,180
last but not least if you see in the

95
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,680
very bottom corner on the right side and

96
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,900
you will have the opportunity at the

97
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,000
very end of this you'll get to meet my

98
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,739
little pup named Sherlock and that is

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,350
her at the very bottom with a little

100
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,440
diaper on and yes she looks like she is

101
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,910
the she's quite peaceful whatnot but act

102
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,650
like you know when she puts on any

103
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,510
clothes she stands still she hates it

104
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,340
completely so I'm going to turn off my

105
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,440
camera so I can focus now on that my

106
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:44,109
presentation I hope you guys don't mind

107
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:46,120
but let's dive into this so this is the

108
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,030
agenda today there's going to be some

109
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,490
history on gamification also how our

110
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,070
brains are stimulated by it and why

111
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,750
gamification helps security teams and

112
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,450
lastly we'll talk a little bit about how

113
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:02,980
gamification has transformed lives a QA

114
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:05,170
and bonus I used to do a funny video but

115
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,840
since I'm actually at home with all you

116
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,150
guys you guys actually get to see a

117
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,789
little bit live of Sherlock which you

118
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,340
see over there in the right side that is

119
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:19,900
her in her happy face and yes she is a

120
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:23,739
Shiba and it is a cat / dog / Fox all

121
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,299
right so what is gamification so

122
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,640
gamification is basically games that

123
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:33,430
work on problem-solving processing speed

124
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:35,349
attention span and memory and we're

125
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,990
gonna dive into the history gamification

126
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:41,710
now this is the driest part but if you

127
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:46,410
focus and pay attention you might win

128
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,409
something very special so here we go

129
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:53,530
at 425 EC dice games were created to

130
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,780
actually fight major famine and in 3100

131

135
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:08,860

next what country invented the first

167
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,350
board game

168
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:48,270
yes you're right Angelica it is Egypt

169
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,910
what airline did the first frequent

170
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,998
flyer program

171
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:59,539
good job rune

172
00:07:52,999 --> 00:08:02,689
all right let's continue so the timeline

173
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:04,818
here now is now we're in 2002 and

174
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:06,589
serious gaming initiatives forges the

175
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:08,899
link between the gaming industry and

176
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:11,269
realizing it actually helps when it

177
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:16,459
comes to training health education and

178
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:20,719
public policy in 2003 Nick telling coins

179
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:22,999
the term gamification in 2007 bunch ball

180
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:25,219
created dunder-mifflin infinity a

181
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:27,499
gamified website for the TV show The

182
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:28,399
Office it receives over 8 million

183
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:32,329
pageviews

184
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:34,399
in six weeks in 2009 quest to learn

185
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:36,620
accepts a class of sixth graders into a

186
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,559
gay based learning environment and in

187
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,060
2010 deaf hub adds a point system to its

188
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:44,810
website and increases its user

189
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:47,209
engagement by 70 percent in 2010

190
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,878
gamification Co holds the first

191
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:54,888
gamification summit guess where San

192
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:56,689
Francisco and in 2012 45,000 enroll in a

193
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:58,430
Professor Kevin Warbucks online

194
00:08:56,689 --> 00:09:01,550
gamification course which was third

195
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,040
Coursera and in 2012 Mozilla opens

196
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,628
badges Initiative is the launch the open

197
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,839
source badges can be used to mark the

198
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:11,120
accomplishments online 2012 gartner

199
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,309
predicts that 70% of global 2000

200
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,389
organizations will have at least one

201
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:19,309
gamified application by 2014 and in 2014

202
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:23,209
m2 Research predicts that gamification

203
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:26,480
will be a 2.8 billion dollar industry by

204
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:29,089
2016 which is true and it went beyond it

205
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,980
is now expected to become 11 billion

206
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:36,559
dollar industry this very year all right

207
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,920
don't worry there's plenty of more time

208
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:43,300
to win here we go oops sorry

209
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,300
who coined the term gamification

210
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:55,389
Shaw was an SF but who coined the term

211
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:58,769
gamification I have to admit this one is

212
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:58,769
the hardest question usually

213
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:06,510
all right we'll go to the next one it's

214
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:09,000
Nick tell me what was the gamified

215
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:12,140
website by bunch ball for the TV show

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,140
the office called

217
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:21,630
yes RJ good job gamification is expected

218
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,600
to become a blank billion dollar

219
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:28,439
industry by 2000 Wow everyone I think it

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,480
was Zach good job Zach all right that's

221
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,970
the end of the pop quiz time or is this

222
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,209
a trick it will be a mission but let's

223
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:39,510
dive right back into the presentation so

224
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:42,420
fact InfoSec has always been gamified

225
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,610
think about it CTF hackathons bug many

226
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,290
many of us became hackers to beat games

227
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,020
and do better than our peers who are

228
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,459
better than us we found cheat codes and

229
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,649
other methods for doing so but most

230
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,719
importantly when we hunt for bones it's

231
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:59,070
like a game of how far does the foxhole

232
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,610
go it's the constant how can I outsmart

233
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:05,160
this and that so of course I'm going to

234
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,260
do an InfoSec timeline and there's way

235
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,949
shorter than the previous ones so pay

236
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:13,110
attention October 10 1995 Netscape

237
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,940
launches the first ever cash reward for

238
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,810
finding security bugs in their Netscape

239
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:23,070
Navigator 2.0 beta and the first DEFCON

240
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:24,540
CTF was in 1996 both betting programs

241
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,670
were created and managed by companies

242
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,980
such as Google Facebook and Mozilla and

243
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,069
those type of platforms are bugcrowd

244
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,130
hacker lawn and cynic Ponte owned

245
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:38,779
started in 2007 and bugged many

246
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:41,160
platforms were founded in 2012 and 2013

247
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:43,320
now if you think about it today

248
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,000
companies are using platforms like this

249
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,550
to provide training for their security

250
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,020
teams more than ever before and that

251
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:53,040
includes actually the company that I

252
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:55,310
work for a point three so I promise it's

253
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,899
back another round of a pop quiz time

254
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:03,540
the first bug bounty program was created

255
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:07,800
in what year 1985 good job Eric when was

256
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:11,279
the first CTF at DEFCON up Zach 1996

257
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,949
good job what are the three major bug

258
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,240
Bank of

259
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,240
in the order of creation

260
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,400
Angelica you are close

261
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:29,630
Zek you are correct it's bugcrowd hacker

262
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,849
1 and cynic that is the end of pop

263
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:34,340
croissant but don't worry this is a

264
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:37,100
complete game if I talk so there's a lot

265
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,540
more so now we're gonna dive into a

266
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,940
little bit about how our brains are

267
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:45,050
stimulated by it and first we're going

268
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,120
to get to know your brain so if you see

269
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,069
here those pop quiz questions stimulate

270
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,780
the green section of the brain the

271
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,880
temporal lobe and now we're going to

272
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:56,420
dive into that area and the area where

273
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,070
gamification thrives so what is the

274
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,170
temporal lobe the temporal lobe is

275
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,270
involved in processing sensory input and

276
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,979
to derive minions for their appropriate

277
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:06,380
retention of visual memory language

278
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,050
comprehension and emotion Association

279
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:12,550
this is where a gamification thrives and

280
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:15,290
when the medulla and hippocampus are and

281
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:17,569
yes there's an activity you guys ready

282
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:20,810
rolling up sleeves unless you're wearing

283
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:23,300
a t-shirt if you are then pretend all

284
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,619
right fill in the blank I would say

285
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,170
shout the answers out but you're not

286
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,770
here so you can do the write in it you

287
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:33,680
ready a plant having a permanently woody

288
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:35,900
main stem usually growing to a high

289
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,349
height and developing branches at some

290
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:43,189
distance from the ground what is it

291
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:45,290
yes trees alright the nutritious orange

292
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,530
to yellow root of a plant of the parsley

293
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,530
family

294
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,880
yes and I like carrot an article of

295
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,839
furniture consisting of a flat top

296
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:00,990
supported on one or more legs yes Eric

297
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,500
table an institution where instruction

298
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,500
is given

299
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:10,229
school correct a moving carriage for

300
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,259
carrying pastures from one level to

301
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:12,259
another

302
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:19,300
yes Jordan elevator a device for

303
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:25,180
transmission of sound or speech to a

304
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:27,579
distant point phone Lily good job a body

305
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,060
of water of considerable size surrounded

306
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,060
by land

307
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:37,330
yes we're like it's like a domestic fowl

308
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:41,290
bred for its flesh eggs and feathers

309
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:44,080
yes sherry it is a chicken hey shallow

310
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:49,860
usually circular dish from which food is

311
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,860
eaten plate good job

312
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:58,689
a perspiration in the form of ice

313
00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:02,680
crystals yes and it is snow any

314
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,680
circulating medium of exchange

315
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:13,350
currency correct that one's a hard one

316
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:16,020
all right so what does activity did was

317
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,720
that a control different parts of your

318
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:23,670
brain first it test out your imagery and

319
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:26,070
your memory but also it was about timing

320
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,779
so the medulla helps with the timing

321
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:31,170
part the hippocampus helps with your

322
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:35,000
memory connecting visual and a word

323
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:39,839
along with it so what is the hippocampus

324
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,570
exactly it's the memory storage and GPS

325
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,070
system of your brain what does that mean

326
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,170
it's where short-term memories in the

327
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,330
hippocampus are then transferred to

328
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,819
long-term memories in the temporal lobe

329
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,920
our conscious memories are formed by the

330
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,440
hippocampus taking a snapshot of

331
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,510
short-term working memory and committing

332
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,680
it to a long-term memory stored in the

333
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:03,810
temporal lobes another activity you guys

334
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,849
ready we're gonna test your hippocampus

335
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:10,540
now the previous will is temporal loop

336
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:13,000
this time its hippocampus and here we go

337
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,709
I want you to look at this list I want

338
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,610
you to read it to yourself

339
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:21,060
I'll give you read through once then a

340
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,060
second time

341
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:32,339
all right next step now the next step is

342
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,709
the following you have two minutes to

343
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:38,310
complete this task so what I'm going to

344
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:40,439
ask you to do is draft an email a doc or

345
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,079
pull up a notes app on your computer I

346
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,420
will give you ten seconds to get this

347
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:48,989
done so on your computer open somewhere

348
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:52,589
where you can take down notes everyone

349
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:54,779
ready all right now you're going to do

350
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,470
is write down those objects that you

351
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:00,209
just saw in the order that they appeared

352
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:03,959
you have two minutes to complete this

353
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:06,260
task ready set and go you have two

354
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,260
minutes

355
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,589
you

356
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:37,480
you have one minute and 26 seconds

357
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:55,140
you have one minute and nine seconds

358
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:11,080
you have less than one minute you're now

359
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:11,080
linking towards 52 seconds

360
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,340
you have 35 seconds now

361
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,810
you

362
00:18:40,590 --> 00:19:00,840
you have 18 seconds now five four three

363
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,449
two one and you're done

364
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:13,810
wasn't that hard that was super hard I'm

365
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:16,360
not gonna lie this is the list so I know

366
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:19,389
that was really hard to do and it is

367
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,110
very hard to do but this is what people

368
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:24,280
that have memorization they play these

369
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:28,270
contests and whatnot these competitions

370
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:31,870
and basically what they do is they think

371
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:34,120
of a game and and by a game I think of a

372
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,770
memory so what you do is when you see a

373
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,000
list like this you want to memorize

374
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,550
things you want to come up with

375
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,190
something that's really crazy so for

376
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:44,409
example I was walking around in London

377
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,170
and carrying an umbrella because it was

378
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,030
raining and I noticed my shoe was untied

379
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:51,280
but when I was going to look down and

380
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,710
like tie it I saw there was a cuddly toy

381
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,260
on the side of the road and it was weird

382
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,060
because right next to it was a like a

383
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,940
melon that was like rotting right

384
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,919
underneath this tree and then I just I

385
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,890
start walking again and then I almost

386
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,500
tripped because I was looking at what I

387
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,360
just saw looked like a pirate but I

388
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,820
almost actually tripped on this yogurt

389
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,350
because the and I I don't know why that

390
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,689
yogurt was there but it was there and

391
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,939
then the parrot was on that pirate so I

392
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,010
was really distracted but I'm so glad I

393
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,870
didn't fall because I have to admit my

394
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,700
laptop was in my bag and would have been

395
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:28,060
destroyed and not just that my red

396
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,920
jumper and this red jumper means a lot

397
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:33,040
because I this is what I usually wear

398
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,490
when I go and play basketball so this is

399
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:39,310
how people memorize these things it's a

400
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:41,440
visual you have to connect the visual

401
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:45,429
with the word to be able to recall the

402
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,060
details so in order to improve your

403
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:51,100
hippocampus research has shown that

404
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,720
crossword puzzles take in a new route

405
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,030
home meaning don't take the same

406
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,460
every time we'll help you improve your

407
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:01,210
hippocampus and also guinea modules

408
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,830
believe it or not so let's dive into the

409
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,840
amygdala now and then make deals my

410
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,020
favorite part of the brain because it is

411
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,330
a survival mechanism the fight versus

412
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,280
flight and basically what that means is

413
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,678
it helps separates

414
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,720
who is like me who is not like me and

415
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,700
these are socially constructed beliefs

416
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,250
so say for example someone told you

417
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:25,270
always be afraid of the person with pink

418
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:27,490
hair now this my this is like one of

419
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,960
those ideas that as a child you're told

420
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,120
people with pink hair are dangerous

421
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,590
individuals so what happens is that

422
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,570
every time you see someone with pink

423
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,289
hair you might hold your purse a little

424
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,299
bit closer

425
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:39,879
or you might cross the street because

426
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:42,070
you see this person with pink hair now

427
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,289
the problem is with that is that this is

428
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,809
also the reason why we have so many

429
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:50,169
prejudice and biases and we have a lot

430
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:51,639
of issues in our society because we have

431
00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:53,770
these ideas that we are told as a child

432
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,539
or through media or whatnot that are

433
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,789
actually not true because the personal

434
00:21:55,539 --> 00:22:00,220
in pink hair just has big hair doesn't

435
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:02,320
mean anything other than that so they

436
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,080
always that we question that is if we

437
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,240
actually hear their stories that's the

438
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,860
only way that we question are socially

439
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,570
constructed beliefs but don't worry that

440
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,789
Magilla the check same with a prefrontal

441
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,470
cortex the front part of your brain to

442
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,510
see whether or not it needs to react so

443
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:20,049
no longer is it something that

444
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,879
subconscious it becomes conscious but

445
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:24,940
then Migdalia the most important part of

446
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,039
this it works on timing then amygdala is

447
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,470
an almond-shaped section of your nervous

448
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,510
tissue located in the temporal side lobe

449
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,730
of the brain which is responsible for

450
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:36,280
your emotions your survival instincts in

451
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,929
your memory and you really like I said

452
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,149
you can't control it only the prefrontal

453
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:42,669
can because it is completely self

454
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:45,520
conscious but this is what we use one

455
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:48,789
word on a time me counting down those

456
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,389
minutes those seconds earlier that

457
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:54,299
forces you to react faster but also for

458
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,720
you to speed up the way that you think

459
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:59,230
all right

460
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,730
we're gonna do another activity now and

461
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:07,000
hopefully my sound works very well

462
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:07,000
because this is a video here we go

463
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:23,700
can you actually hear this can someone

464
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,980
put in there if you can hear it or not

465
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:31,750
nope okay don't worry

466
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:43,230
now let's try watch this series of

467
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:48,340
images very closely ready shoes or keys

468
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:55,330
at this beach oh this I don't see either

469
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:57,610
the shoes or the keys did you see them

470
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,010
this time you probably did

471
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:03,580
now we're gonna play a different series

472
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:06,060
of it did anyone see the keys or the

473
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,060
shoes

474
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:13,030
okay you guys are really good majority

475
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,600
of people do not see that now here we go

476
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:17,620
again

477
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:32,800
you ready images and test you on the

478
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:34,780
master ready snakes spiders it slowed

479
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,629
down the images I assure you we did not

480
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,389
all we did was substitute the shoes and

481
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,980
keys with pictures of snakes and spiders

482
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:46,300
why did one set of images jump back

483
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:50,860
while the other didn't that question you

484
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:54,780
do not need to know from Caron I'm gonna

485
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,780
teach you and so

486
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,050
the one thing up I'll just go back to

487
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:03,899
this so just to briefly summarize that

488
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:06,600
what happened was that for many people

489
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,130
they didn't catch the keys ant I mean

490
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,919
the keys on the shears because it's

491
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:13,740
everyday items but when your amygdala is

492
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,510
on fire in other words when we see

493
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,390
things that we were socially constructed

494
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:20,160
to believe of a threat so spiders and

495
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,690
snakes are one of those things that

496
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,480
we've been told like stay away they're

497
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:26,820
really really dangerous that's the

498
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,940
reason why we actually freaked out and

499
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,700
so we actually pay faster attention so

500
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,070
remember your amygdala can actually take

501
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,690
over to some extent and I don't know if

502
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:39,928
anyone's ever been in a car accident

503
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:41,730
before but if you have there's a moment

504
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:43,350
when you've had really bad ones where

505
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:46,740
everything seems like it's in slow

506
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:49,800
motion now what this is called is

507
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,530
amygdala hijack it's when you no longer

508
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,960
have control of your prefrontal part of

509
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,480
your brain instead what's happening is

510
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,020
your medulla has taken over completely

511
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,059
so everything seems a lot slower because

512
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,670
you're a hundred percent focus on that

513
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:08,550
very moment because of fear and you're

514
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:11,429
in survival mode so you'll go in this

515
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:13,350
when your survival mode and so just

516
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:15,600
remember that the amygdala and the

517
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:19,230
hippocampus play a huge role when we're

518
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,780
doing gaming and if you are really

519
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:23,970
scared of spiders or snakes I feel you I

520
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:27,870
hate I hate spiders

521
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:29,940
with yeah I hate spiders all right so

522
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,559
let's talk a little about how now why

523
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,110
I'm gamification helps security teams

524
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:36,270
let's be real serfs are not enough

525
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,860
there's new tools and new exploits that

526
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,230
come out all the time and being aware of

527
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,360
everything at all times and the trends

528
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:45,840
along with burnout lack of team members

529
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,219
it leaves us in a huge security risk so

530
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,290
I mean how many of you guys have

531
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,179
experienced a shortage on your team and

532
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:54,379
having to take on other hats to help

533
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,380
everything move along

534
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:03,080
a lot all the time right I feel you

535
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:05,630
Cherie an RJ hmm and that's exactly the

536
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,928
problem is that's why we need to dive

537
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:10,670
into sorry I'm losing my voice let's

538
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:13,070
dive into why it's needed more than ever

539
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:18,620
and how it's becoming a priority for the

540
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:19,970
intersect community in 2020 gamification

541
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,469
combined with the other latest

542
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,540
technologies and trends will have a

543
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,730
significant impact on the design of

544
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,399
employee performance globalization of

545
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,440
higher education and innovation let's

546
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,900
dive into some more facts shall we and

547
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,030
if you hear my dog right now she is

548
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,130
nipping me because she wants attention

549
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,139
Sherlock it's okay honey I'll be there

550
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,770
in a little bit later all right

551
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:44,030
I have fact number one within

552
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:46,100
organizations that whole gamification

553
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,740
exercises hackathons and capture the

554
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,840
flag Red Team Blue Team or plug Daddy

555
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:54,350
programs are the most common and almost

556
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:58,928
all 96% of those use gamification in the

557
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,928
workplace report seeing actual benefits

558
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:04,520
fact number two more than half 57

559
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,010
percent of respondents report that using

560
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,520
game increases awareness IT staff

561
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:12,590
knowledge of how breaches can occur and

562
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,090
43% said gamification enforces a team

563
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,418
work culture needed for a quick

564
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:19,610
effective cybersecurity program and 77%

565
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:21,860
of senior managers agree that their

566
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:24,959
organization would be safer if they use

567
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:28,540
more gamification

568
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,690
fact 3 we are now heading towards a

569
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,100
three million shortage of personnel to

570
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,660
address the shortage and skilled

571
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,490
cybersecurity workers the reports

572
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,190
suggest that gamers those engage in

573
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,280
immerse in online competitions may be

574
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:44,290
the logical next step to plug in the gap

575
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,330
nearly all 92 percent of respondents

576
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,280
believe that gaming affords players an

577
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:50,580
experience and skills critical to cyber

578
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,629
security threat hunting such as logic

579
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,178
perseverance and understanding of how to

580
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:57,460
approach adversaries and a fresh outlook

581
00:28:55,179 --> 00:29:00,280
compared to a traditional cyber security

582
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:04,299
hires sure like please stop fighting me

583
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:06,340
alright back for 77 percent of employees

584
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:08,350
find game based training to be more

585
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,620
effective than traditional training

586
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:13,299
methods that's right how many you guys

587
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,709
remembered what you learn in the class

588
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:17,100
and when you were in fifth or sixth

589
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:20,290
grade do you ever remember this pop quiz

590
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,760
test back then yeah I didn't think so

591
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,799
reading in a book is great and

592
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,100
everything but many of us don't learn

593
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:29,320
that way practical and action ways of

594
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,820
like basically where it's hands-on is

595
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,149
the fastest way for us to learn

596
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,149
knowledge

597
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:41,250
fact 5 biases resumes and team building

598
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:43,290
learning how to improve teams and

599
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:46,110
providing more trainings and investment

600
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:48,690
and employees is the most important

601
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:50,399
thing and gamification helps a finding

602
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:53,340
talent recognition and how do they do

603
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,500
that well I'm not trying to plug my my

604
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:59,580
company in but we do have something that

605
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:03,210
basically it's a program that you can

606
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:05,520
use to see if a candidate is actually

607
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:08,940
able to do their role or their job so

608
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,250
basically think of a gamified version of

609
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,440
their role and then testing them to see

610
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,360
if they're good at what they do I think

611
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,730
of it this as a better way because I

612
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,250
don't know about you Bisons do exist so

613
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:22,470
if I put out a resume out there and

614
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,630
being a woman and whatnot they may not

615
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:27,270
see me as something technical because of

616
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,590
my gender and because of that they are

617
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:30,809
not going to take me as seriously

618
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:33,120
through the pipeline so one of the

619
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:34,830
things is by getting rid of names and

620
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,530
getting rid of this whole thing about

621
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:39,120
certs as showing everything that the

622
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:41,549
person is able to do their job why not

623
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,830
just test them so we get rid of the

624
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:45,990
resume idea we forget about certs

625
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,299
because at the reality of this an

626
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:50,549
InfoSec it really doesn't matter it's

627
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:52,620
about do you have what it takes to do

628
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:56,100
this role and that's all we need to know

629
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:58,168
is are you able to perform because serfs

630
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,209
aren't going to do anything in a sense

631
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:03,540
they're really gonna help you get into

632
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:05,760
the door the doorway I want that but

633
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,500
it's really your ability to perform and

634
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,360
here's some experience is also

635
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,610
misleading because you can have less

636
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,830
than one or two years of experience and

637
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:16,020
actually be a top performer and we have

638
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,939
seen that and research has seen that as

639
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,220
well it's how performers don't usually

640
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,559
have the certs or actually have the

641
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:26,540
years of experience that jobs are

642
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,540
requiring for a job role

643
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:31,539
and because of that we now also are

644
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:36,240
dealing with a shortage but we also have

645
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:39,029
a skills gap and because think about it

646
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,789
skills gaps are also happening because

647
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:46,240
it's we're not having the time to learn

648
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:48,309
new material or we don't have time to do

649
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,559
other things so how are we going to

650
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:51,580
practice our own skills it's really

651
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,918
challenging especially if you have kids

652
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:57,250
and especially when you're like right

653
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:00,220
now at home having to stay at home and

654
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:03,730
you have kids running around it's hard

655
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,890
to find time and with the skills gap and

656
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,750
everything it's also pushing people to

657
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,250
burnout because they're having to force

658
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,600
themselves to learn really fast

659
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,059
especially when they have less team

660
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:17,590
members and then also at this point it

661
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:20,279
also adds up to having breeches later on

662
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:20,279
and

663
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,580
tell me you guys what is the percentage

664
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,439
of companies that adopt a gamification

665
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:34,389
workplace report seeing benefits

666
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:37,000
Anjelica 96% good job so we talked a

667
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,680
little bit into you know the stats of

668
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,740
gaming we've got into the brain

669
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,410
now we're gonna dive a little bit about

670
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:46,240
what Gamma Phi Gamma finishin has done

671
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:49,240
to transform lives and what's

672
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,040
importantly gamification has can teach

673
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,630
us and lead new people to enter the

674
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,820
space or to be recognised for their

675
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:56,500
talent and this could solve the gender

676
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,240
biases that InfoSec has been dealing

677
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,790
with ongoing and it's not just gender

678
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,040
it's anyone who's underrepresented in

679
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:05,020
this field is really struggling to get

680
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,139
their foot in the door and also to stay

681
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,810
within it so gamification can really

682
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:14,740
help us with the three million personnel

683
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:17,050
shortage right now and I want to tell

684
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,330
you a little bit about Veronica so

685
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:21,010
Veronica she has a BA and computer

686
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,510
science and this is by accident she

687
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:24,730
planned to actually study Latin and

688
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:27,370
Greek but also took a computer science

689
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:28,900
class but when leaving college she

690
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:33,129
started having no more of an interest of

691
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:35,920
starting a PhD instead so but she wanted

692
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:37,960
to make sure if this is for her not so

693
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,240
she did youth development for about five

694
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,590
years after graduating she loved it but

695
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,450
she didn't feel like a challenge her in

696
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,970
the way that inspired and empowered her

697
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,800
so she was basically looking around

698
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,630
seeing if there was anything out there a

699
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,940
program and she came across a

700
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,950
partnership with the DoD boot camp and

701
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,600
it drew her to it they were saying in

702
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:58,420
there you don't have to have any

703
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,800
experience whatsoever in InfoSec but

704
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,020
they're looking for people that are good

705
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,000
at problem solving ability and being

706
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,770
able to work on problems for a long time

707
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,600
and willingness to do discipline

708
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:11,440
learning and that was all that they put

709
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,739
in the blurb they also say that you need

710
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,050
to be open to working with patterns and

711
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:19,178
puzzles so she started the reverse

712
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:21,540
engineering challenge and this was all

713
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:25,060
on the escalate platform and afterwards

714
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:27,070
because she was so good is that she went

715
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,230
to go work for a consulting company for

716
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:31,149
about six months with an InfoSec right

717
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:34,149
after that program and her favorite

718
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:35,888
thing was reverse engineering her

719
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:38,069
actual title at the time was a

720
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:42,129
consultant as a pen tester and

721
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:44,168
afterwards 0.3 basically try to pulled

722
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:45,190
her in and so they shared that they had

723
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:47,348
it opening was wondering if she would

724
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:50,168
like to join because her performance was

725
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:52,869
so amazing during the boot camp and so

726
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:55,299
now she works with us and spent over a

727
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:58,630
year now she never set out to be a

728
00:34:55,299 --> 00:35:00,880
hacker you should know this but what she

729
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:03,279
did realize is that if she were to go

730
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,960
through her Google search she would look

731
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:06,760
into seeing that she was always

732
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,589
wondering about web app strategies and

733
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,539
how one can manipulate to change and

734
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:12,369
shape even when she was doing her you

735
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:17,849
development for about five years after

736
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:20,140
graduating the next person is Valentina

737
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:22,569
Valentina she lives in Chicago Illinois

738
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,848
and she first studied psychology and

739
00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:26,410
wasn't a big fan of math yeah she took a

740
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:28,690
math class in college and slowly

741
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,788
discovered she happened to have a love

742
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:33,520
for math which is very common for many

743
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:35,710
of us how many of us have gone into like

744
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,420
we're doing math back in school before

745
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,640
at college and we're like this is the

746
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,200
worst thing in the world and then

747
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,558
suddenly you go to college like oh wait

748
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,569
this is math this is so much better so

749
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,599
she went to school then to study math at

750
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:51,880
UIC and she did an undergrad internship

751
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,859
in the physics department which she had

752
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,270
to learn basic coding and took some

753
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:57,940
classes in computer science as well

754
00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:00,309
after she became an economist at the

755
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:02,260
Federal Reserve back a bank and then

756
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:04,869
discovered there was a passion in

757
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,849
computers the ability to tell what a

758
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:08,410
computer what to do and build anything

759
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:10,630
was something that was really empowering

760
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:12,399
for her and she really want to learn a

761
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,069
little bit more and computer-security

762
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,809
sounded really interesting maybe because

763
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:19,210
of hacking and hacking always sounded

764
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:21,160
really pretty cool to her plus she saw

765
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,130
it in movies and just it was seem so

766
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,500
interesting and her favorite favorite

767
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:29,529
favorite movie at the time that inspired

768
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,599
her was movie hackers and it was that

769
00:36:29,529 --> 00:36:33,480
early computer internet culture and the

770
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,180
hacker community image that she really

771
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,630
it drew her to it so when she saw a

772
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,589
press release from the mayor of Chicago

773
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:44,260
there was something on there saying

774
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:46,599
they're looking for applications for a

775
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,970
special boot camp which was sponsored by

776
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:50,520
Escalade and DOD

777
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:52,230
and this once again a dance state you

778
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,599
have to have an InfoSec background a

779
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:58,020
computer science background you just

780
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:01,859
need to know to have that passion for

781
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:04,590
puzzles and this tenacity to never keep

782
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:06,990
looking and whatnot so she had zero

783
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:09,690
experience remember she only really knew

784
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:12,209
basic coding and took like a class in

785
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,490
computer science economist not not but

786
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:17,130
with zero experience within the first

787
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:20,729
three months of her six-month boot camp

788
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,920
she got a job immediately as a software

789
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:27,590
developer and now she's a vulnerability

790
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,590
researcher which is fantastic and

791
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,220
honestly there's a lot of other stories

792
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,140
that I've heard but I would love to hear

793
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,598
if any of you guys have have a story

794
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:39,359
that's similar to any of Veronica or

795
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:43,140
Valentina and yes that is Sherlock there

796
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:45,029
I have an obsession with my puppy um so

797
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:48,618
tell me you guys which person was

798
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,619
inspired by the movie hackers

799
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:54,519
Valentina a good job Jeremy and yes I

800
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:57,060
love wargame sherry it's such an awesome

801
00:37:54,519 --> 00:38:00,180
movie all right

802
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:04,200
um from stories brain function and

803
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:08,220
history it is clear that gamification is

804
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:13,649
a necessity so we can all be superheroes

805
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:16,859
every single day and I want to share now

806
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:20,520
in the last bit here is that on Thursday

807
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:22,050
we launched a hack to help CTF so if I

808
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,900
were you guys if you're interested in

809
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:28,440
doing a CTF this is perfect everyone is

810
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:31,980
able to do this and the grand prize

811
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:35,220
winner will have the opportunity to have

812
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:37,470
a point three to write a donation on

813
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,959
behalf of their honor to either mental

814
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:43,049
health hackers or innocent lives which

815
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,820
is very very important to do and we're

816
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:46,230
also looking at some other orgs on case

817
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,910
if the winner wants to pick another one

818
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:51,090
they'll have a chance to we're looking

819
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:53,879
at the food bank so make sure to check

820
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:56,370
out this it's a lot of fun and it's

821
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,200
three weeks rep like long so you need to

822
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:00,330
participate now in the first release

823
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,790
then there's a second one and whatnot

824
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:05,390
and I will definitely post the link in

825
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:05,390
slack

826
00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:11,569
um also this is a really important time

827
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:13,430
to note that there are some resources

828
00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:15,170
that I may have shared or may have not

829
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:18,290
shared so I wanted to take this time to

830
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:21,290
do that many of you guys probably were

831
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:24,619
on the earlier presentation from Melissa

832
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:27,800
Miller but her and Phil Wiley and myself

833
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:30,230
we are all involved with the itsp

834
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,660
magazine uncommon journey podcast we

835
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,819
basically interview people like that you

836
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,649
guys like to follow on Twitter and we

837
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:38,839
asked them about their personal lives

838
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,920
before they got into InfoSec and what

839
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:41,779
were the lessons learned when they

840
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,690
entered so it's really fun to you check

841
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,130
it out what not the hacker book club is

842
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,640
something that I created recently so

843
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:51,589
it's basically we read like books are

844
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,740
written by hackers in our community and

845
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:56,779
the community that we are in also reads

846
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,149
them and anyone can join we have weekly

847
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,430
virtual meetings it's every Tuesday at 5

848
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,559
p.m. Pacific time people bring their

849
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,180
wine to bring their beer or whatnot or

850
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:08,780
drinking your water or tea it's up to

851
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:12,109
you and then we will be starting a new

852
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,760
book in about two weeks time with Marcus

853
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:16,520
Carey it's gonna be tribe of hackers

854
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,859
it's a great book and you may have heard

855
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,990
or may have not heard yet but I did

856
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:23,750
create an ethical hackers write petition

857
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:26,299
and there's the link right there and I

858
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:28,670
would love for you guys to sign it I'm

859
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:31,130
trying to get a thousand signatures so

860
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:34,640
if I get a thousand signatures I can

861
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:36,500
work and partner with DOJ DoD and AFF

862
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,270
it's really important that we get all

863
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,980
these signatures and go beyond a

864
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,380
thousand so we can do something about

865
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:45,290
this and try to change the landscape

866
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:47,839
that we are currently still in very much

867
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,869
so so please sign it or share it around

868
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,660
it's super important for us to do that

869
00:40:49,869 --> 00:40:56,420
last but not least I did start up a

870
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,490
hacker community Cove in nineteen

871
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,740
volunteer chat support this is not for

872
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:03,589
crisis or whatnot this is for us to be

873
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,020
like pen pals kind of thing but through

874
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:08,000
phone calls

875
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,799
basically I partnered up with mental

876
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,750
health hackers and what we're doing is

877
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:14,119
we're trying to find volunteers before

878
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,869
we launch this program this upcoming

879
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,059
week

880
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:19,130
so anyone can register to talk to

881
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:21,560
someone anywhere between ten minutes

882
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:23,330
- one hour long and it's a really great

883
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,670
opportunity because many of us feel

884
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,900
isolated and alone and we want to talk

885
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:29,240
to someone so this is a great

886
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:31,450
opportunity to make new friends possibly

887
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:35,299
you could talk about whatever you want

888
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:37,069
from books to Netflix or to even how

889
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,350
you're feeling if you're concerned your

890
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,970
worries or whatnot this is a great

891
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:44,299
opportunity we need to be together as a

892
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:46,009
community more than ever before also

893
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,110
here are some two other ones that are

894
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:50,420
really important if you do talk to

895
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:52,640
anyone who is suffering a lot and they

896
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:56,030
need to talk to someone there's a crisis

897
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,180
text line and it's a great organization

898
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:00,680
it actually has therapists online

899
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,080
they're certified and whatnot so they're

900
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,640
able to help you this is great to share

901
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,380
with your friends and family if they

902
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,870
need it and also a national suicide

903
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,330
prevention hotline if you are feeling it

904
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:13,700
really deep in depression and you having

905
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:15,440
some interesting thoughts interesting

906
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,870
but terrible thoughts dark thoughts

907

whatnot please call that line it's

908
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:23,509
really important I know that all of us

909
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:26,630
have lost someone at some point of time

910
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:28,340
because of suicide so please push those

911
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,650
two out there for everyone in the

912
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,150
community to know it is super important

913
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,860
right now for them to know that these

914
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:37,940
are these resources while we go through

915
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:39,800
