all right well hello b-sides Atlanta

41
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,270
hopefully with that I've got your

42
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,560
attention

43
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:20,580
so I'm Melissa Miller and super excited

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,230
to be here definitely you know with

45
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,690
everything that's going on here kind of

46
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,480
a weird environment to have to do these

47
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,880
things online but hey we're gonna make

48
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,549
it work and I'm really happy to be here

49
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,470
so let me tell you first of all just a

50
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,269
little about me and let me get rid of

51
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,519
this thing I love the fact that zoom

52
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:41,550
loves to put that up there every chance

53
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,230
it gets so a little bit about me so

54
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,150
first of all for those of you that don't

55
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,750
know me I'm a hacker and a researcher

56
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,060
I've been what I would call hacking

57
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,730
since I was very early on in childhood

58
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,420
started with just technology toys taking

59
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,970
things apart and figuring out how they

60
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,980
all worked when I turned 12 I actually

61
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:06,510
bought my first computer taught myself

62
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:09,630
how to program in basic and did some

63
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:13,078
hacking in some online services and some

64
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,190
things finding my way into and beyond

65
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:19,170
paywalls

66
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:22,079
things of that nature so nowadays I've

67
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,540
been doing a lot of research into things

68
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:29,519
around machine learning and deep fake

69
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,650
videos but beyond that I'm also a

70
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,660
security advocate which is why I'm here

71
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,450
talking to you today as a security

72
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,720
advocate I do like to get out and talk

73
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,390
with the community I like to share my

74
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,880
ideas hear what other people's ideas are

75
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,369
maybe you have them challenge my ideas

76
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,989
challenge my thoughts just discuss this

77
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,049
whole big thing that we call security

78
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:55,109
right it's security is so pervasive in

79
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,959
every part of our lives these days and

80
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:00,840
being able to go out and to share that

81
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,819
information and to just talk about it is

82
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,850
something that I really enjoy now

83
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:08,730
recently I did also start working for an

84
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,340
organization called sneek and so within

85
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,280
sneaked my actual job title is

86
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,870
application security advocate so my role

87
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,380
now within

88
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:22,470
is to get out with the community talk

89
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,139
about what it is that we do in terms of

90
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,139
application security how as security

91
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:31,500
practitioners we can get better being a

92
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:35,370
part of this culture we call dev SEC ops

93
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,190
and so forth and then finally I'm an

94
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,740
author and a blogger I am working on a

95
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:43,530
book currently to help those that are

96
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,930
trying to get into security careers to

97
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,239
start to build their careers I do blog

98
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:54,110
fairly regularly both for my employer

99
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:56,910
and as well for my own personal

100
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,950
gratification I guess or just again

101
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,900
another way to share that information so

102
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,479
you can visit my website and and view

103
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,299
that blog as well and then finally I am

104
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,270
a co-host on a podcast called the

105
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,060
uncommon journey where really our focus

106
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:15,479
is just to share the stories all those

107
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:19,950
unique stories that people have for how

108
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,960
they got into cybersecurity and if you

109
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,900
look around our community you'll see

110
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,539
there's so many unique different stories

111
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,138
for how people got here and so we like

112
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:33,570
to share those stories with the world

113
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,789
speaking of stories I want to share a

114
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:39,150
story with you

115
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:42,510
so I'm here today to talk to you about

116
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:45,510
threat modeling and this story goes back

117
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:48,979
a number of years when I was working as

118
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:52,229
a consultant for an application security

119
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:54,000
consultancy company and we were working

120
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,580
with an organization that had

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,220
established actually a really pretty

122
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:03,389
impressive threatened threat modeling

123
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,160
program so they had made this program of

124
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:08,130
theirs very efficient they had

125
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,169
streamlined and standardized the whole

126
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,860
process for how they did it and it

127
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:16,260
consisted of some front work where the

128
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,120
engineering teams and the project teams

129
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,159
had to create some diagrams and answers

130
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,440
some questionnaires and then they got

131
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,479
together at a meeting and in the course

132
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,070
of about an hour or two they walked

133
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
through all the information about this

134
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,069
application

135
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,049
that's how they built out their threat

136
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:35,289
model we came out of it with action

137
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,389
items specifications for certain

138
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:41,199
security controls that would have to be

139
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:43,990
implemented and so forth it was a really

140
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,020
impressive process and all said and done

141
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,430
it took generally between 8 to 16 hours

142
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,690
to complete this process so 1 to 2 days

143
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,550
for those of you that have done threat

144
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,490
modeling before you know doing threat

145
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:02,620
modeling in one to two days is pretty

146
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:06,400
impressive but I remember going into one

147
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:09,789
of these sessions as a consultant to

148
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,979
assist them with this process and after

149
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:14,949
we got done with the conversation and we

150
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:17,068
we came out of that meeting I was

151
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:21,159
talking with one of the developers and

152
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:22,960
he made the comment to me you know I I

153
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:24,580
can't wait until we're done doing this

154
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,318
and we don't have to do these anymore

155
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,180
and I I was kind of confused what do you

156
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,050
what do you mean why wouldn't you have

157
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:34,419
to do threat modeling and the next words

158
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,840
stuck with me and he said well we're

159
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:40,750
moving to you DevOps and you you can't

160
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,989
do threat modeling in DevOps it takes

161
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,719
too long it doesn't work with we're

162
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,659
trying to implement this CI CD pipeline

163
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:51,400
and we can't do that if we're doing dev

164
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:53,110
up or if we're doing threat modeling in

165
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,758
the middle of that depth that's gonna be

166
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:59,110
inhibited and that got me thinking and I

167
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,349
started thinking about threat modeling

168
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:05,620
and I started thinking about how people

169
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:08,349
look at threat modeling so for those of

170
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,780
you who have done threat modeling before

171
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:12,400
you may be familiar with this book or if

172
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,138
you've had any interest in threat

173
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,690
modeling you may be familiar with this

174
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:19,870
book you may have read this book this is

175
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:24,190
the book by Adam Shostak this book came

176
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:27,460
out years ago and it details it is

177
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:30,159
probably the gold standard for the

178
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,939
process of conducting threat modeling

179
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,599
within an organization but it came out

180
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,459
years ago

181
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:42,040
and while this book is worded and

182
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:44,660
written to be very

183
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,390
non-prescriptive to be very flexible to

184
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,000
offer frameworks without being too

185
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,520
granular unfortunately it gets taken

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,620
very verbatim and there's a lot of

187
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,770
processes there's a lot of requirements

188
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:01,460
a lot of different steps to that threat

189
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:03,860
modeling discipline that are presented

190
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,750
in this book that people try to

191
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,000
implement as part of their threat

192
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,520
modeling as they should but

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
unfortunately it leads people to view

194
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:17,120
threat modeling as this very heavyweight

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,970
very time-consuming very difficult

196
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,290
process if we start to break it down we

197
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:26,210
can see why so within this process this

198
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,219
is one of the things that they tell you

199
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:31,250
you're supposed to create this is a data

200
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,320
flow diagram and the approach to threat

201
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,170
modeling is we've got this large

202
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,450
application this large monolithic thing

203
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,939
that we're going to look at maybe it's

204
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,980
even as simple as a micro-service but we

205
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,260
still we want to look at it holistically

206
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,630
we're going to talk about all the places

207
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,160
that data flows in and out we're gonna

208
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,600
talk about those different trust

209
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,760
boundaries we're gonna talk about where

210
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,130
data gets stored we're gonna talk about

211
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,560
how data gets processed at each step of

212
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:00,980
its journey through the application and

213
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:04,819
this is where we begin for a lot of

214
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,070
organizations just creating that is very

215
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,480
time consuming especially if you've

216
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,910
never done a threat model for that

217
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,250
application before now you have to

218
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,010
create this entire diagram now imagine

219
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,720
trying to do that when you're in a CI CD

220
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:22,550
environment and things are constantly

221
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,930
changing that becomes problematic then

222
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,630
it moves on and we're supposed to create

223
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,579
these attack tree drawings so there's a

224
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,020
lot of drawings and things being created

225
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,000
as part of a traditional threat model

226
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,730
approach and they become very

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,140
time-consuming so this is now I've laid

228
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,760
it out and I kind of understand what my

229
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,790
threats are and I'm gonna lay out how

230
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,490
those threats travel through my system

231
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:47,060
but again very time-consuming if it's a

232
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:49,790
large application in particular one of

233
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,010
the other issues that I see with the

234
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,980
traditional threat modeling is this idea

235
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,230
of stride if you're involved in threat

236
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,870
MA

237
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,290
you've almost assuredly heard of stride

238
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:03,450
before stride is nothing but a way to

239
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,189
categorize the different threats the

240
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:08,070
problem I have with stride is that it's

241
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,810
very technically focused if you look at

242
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,940
this you see things like spoofing and

243
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,579
tampering and repudiation information

244
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,980
disclosure denial of service elevation

245
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,770
of privilege these are all things that

246
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,510
at a functional level when we're talking

247
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,180
to the people who will use an

248
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,700
application the people who understand

249
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,229
how it applies to the business they

250
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,580
don't necessarily understand what these

251
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,000
terms even mean

252
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:35,460
so this can be really troublesome

253
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,460
because it means that there's this high

254
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,470
bar of technical aptitude that people

255
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:44,130
conducting threat modeling within our

256
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,360
organizations have to achieve and then

257
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,370
we move on then we have these things

258
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,970
like dread and then dread wasn't enough

259
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:53,700
so he came out with dread + D + + threat

260
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:56,190
is ok now that we know all of these

261
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,160
threats how are we gonna categorize them

262
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,910
in terms of their overall severity and

263
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,370
so forth

264
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,439
and so there's all these frameworks

265
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:08,220
there's others you may have heard of

266
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,960
pasta and people have taken a lot of

267
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,290
different approaches to just how do we

268
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:16,130
do threat modeling and you'll see them

269
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:20,040
documenting you'll see different

270
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:23,939
diagrams that try to show what this

271
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,860
process looks like but that became so

272
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,440
complex that we we wanted to start

273
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:32,040
looking at well how do we look at common

274
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,930
attack vectors a common threat so then

275
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,610
we we created this thing called CAPA

276
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:40,560
right and cat-back is a way to document

277
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,900
threats that are common across multiple

278
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,280
applications and so forth but the

279
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,930
taxonomy looks something like this

280
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:51,839
diagram here so we've added even more

281
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:54,959
complexity on top of this so it's no

282
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,870
wonder then that developers who are

283
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,870
entering a DevOps model look at this and

284
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:04,620
say there's no way that this fits so

285
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:07,080
around about 2008 DevOps became a thing

286
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,490
right Patrick Dubois another individual

287
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,260
in Belgium got to get

288
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:13,470
and they said hey why can't we develop

289
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:16,860
differently well they were developers

290
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,480
and their focus was how do we make

291
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,850
development faster how do we make it

292
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,680
easier how do we make it so that we can

293
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:27,149
respond quickly to the needs of our

294
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:29,189
users those are great things for

295
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:31,920
developers to be thinking about that's

296
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:35,430
what we want out of an entire

297
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,229
development organization we want our

298
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:42,500
culture to be one where we're always

299
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:44,279
trying to move quickly create quickly

300
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,140
deploy quickly

301
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,000
that's what DevOps is about it's about

302
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:51,089
this culture and it's about bringing

303
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,240
together dev and ops together to be this

304
00:13:51,089 --> 00:14:00,290
shared responsibility for quickly

305
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,290
delivering stable software now

306
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:08,479
DevOps security got left out of that

307
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,459
conversation and security got left out

308
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,910
of that conversation because everything

309
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:18,349
that we gave to the development teams

310
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:20,629
were hurdles we put gates in the way you

311
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,949
had to pass this quality gate for

312
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:25,249
security before he could move to

313
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:28,719
production you had to do the static code

314
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:30,769
analysis you had to do dynamic

315
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,540
application analysis we had to go

316
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:35,300
through pen tests we had to do all of

317
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,160
these things that stood in the way of

318
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,569
you taking code from your development

319
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,389
environment and getting it into

320
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:43,069
production we as security made it as

321
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,920
hard as possible and as a result we got

322
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:48,878
left out of this conversation

323
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:51,319
so threat modeling was a part of that

324
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,619
threat modeling was one of those things

325
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:56,959
that although it it wasn't well adopted

326
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:58,639
universally it was something that we

327
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:03,709
kept telling developers they needed to

328
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:05,869
do but why why what is threat modeling

329
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:09,739
why do we do threat modeling what is

330
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:10,910
this big old thing so as I started

331
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,589
thinking about threat modeling and all

332
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,949
the problems I asked myself that

333
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:18,679
question how do i define threat modeling

334
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:21,079
how does the industry define threat

335
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:22,579
modeling now normally if we were in

336
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,910
person this is where I would ask you to

337
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:28,189
to tell me your ideas of how you would

338
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,740
define threat modeling but we're a

339
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:32,059
little less interactive here today but

340
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,699
I'm gonna ask you to at least think

341
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:35,839
about it in your head for a moment if

342
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,939
someone came to you and said how would

343
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,619
you define threat modeling what would

344
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:45,498
you tell them so I did what we always do

345
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:52,389
we found Google and I went on I started

346
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:56,509
looking for some of these possible

347
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:58,549
definitions and one of the first

348
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:03,679
definitions I found here that you can

349
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:07,790
see was from a wasp and in that

350
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:10,709
definition they you can see how complex

351
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:15,089
this is this is

352
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:16,560
not an easy-to-follow definition I'm not

353
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,680
even gonna read it to you because it's

354
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,530
so long and lengthy but you can see it

355
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,260
centers around very technical terms like

356
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:29,310
denial of service failure of a storage

357
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,870
device we see all the the classic

358
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,800
vulnerabilities and threats and

359
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:37,890
countermeasures and mitigations and this

360
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,109
is an unwieldy definition so in addition

361
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:43,500
to a complex process now we can't even

362
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:47,910
define this thing easily but wasp isn't

363
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,980
alone I went to Wikipedia

364
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:54,839
I mean if it's on Wikipedia it's true

365
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,860
right and it was just as complex and

366
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,200
we're talking about things about

367
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,900
attackers profile and attack vectors and

368
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,340
assets most desired by the attacker

369
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:06,420
answers questions like where am i most

370
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:08,069
vulnerable oh my gosh this is such a

371
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,480
lengthy definition who's going to be

372
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:14,730
able to read this and actually make use

373
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:17,819
of this so it's still complex well ok

374
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:21,420
Microsoft wrote the book on it what does

375
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,919
Microsoft say well Microsoft simplifies

376
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,450
it a bit right they bring it down to

377
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,630
it's an engineering technique you can

378
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,650
use to help you identify threats attacks

379
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,640
vulnerabilities and countermeasures that

380
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:38,280
could affect your applications this is

381
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:40,830
still lengthy and it's still not simple

382
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,889
enough because when we go to developers

383
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,870
and we're in a DevOps environment we

384
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,990
need to be able to explain it succinctly

385
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:52,169
quickly help them understand why this is

386
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:54,030
something that they want to do why this

387
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:58,400
is something that's going to enable them

388
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,399
to be better in their development so

389
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,960
when I think about threat modeling and I

390
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:08,630
thought long and hard on this like how

391
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:12,330
am I going to really define this I

392
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:16,770
decided let's just take it back to the

393
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:19,139
just the bare objective of why do i do

394
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,770
threat modeling when I think about

395
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,910
threat modeling at its core it is simply

396
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:28,190
answering the

397
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:31,620
Jhin what could possibly go wrong I'm

398
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:35,820
looking at my application and I want to

399
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:38,879
know from a security perspective what

400
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:42,990
could possibly go wrong where are those

401
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:46,170
areas where it could be targeted for

402
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:49,770
attack where threats are most likely

403
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:53,220
going to want to manipulate or to attack

404
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:59,010
that application in some way this is

405
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:04,560
what I do threat modeling for so finally

406
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:07,020
a succinct definition the reason we

407
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,990
threat model is to identify the likely

408
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:12,180
threats to a system so that we can

409
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:16,150
inform the design of security

410
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:18,040
countermeasures that's it

411
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,460
we're just trying to say these are the

412
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,200
threats therefore this is how you need

413
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,160
to design security countermeasures in

414
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,410
the system

415
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,260
I searched long and hard for this

416
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:33,490
definition you know who authored this

417
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:36,160
definition I had to because I couldn't

418
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:39,550
find anything this simple this

419
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,080
straightforward but the reality is it is

420
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:44,260
just that simple and that's

421
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,399
straightforward so when I started to

422
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:50,740
think about threat modeling in these

423
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:54,700
terms now I can start to explain to my

424
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:58,930
developers to my business owners to my

425
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:02,830
security leaders we can do threat

426
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:09,190
modeling in DevOps without breaking

427
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:12,010
devops now how are we gonna do that how

428
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,110
are we going to use threat modeling now

429
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:18,220
to start to create this thing that we've

430
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:20,740
thrown the term out there dev sec ops we

431
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,930
want security to be a part of this

432
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,270
culture and indeed when we talk about

433
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,880
DevOps if I go back to 2008 and I look

434
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:30,790
at where DevOps came from DevOps was

435
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,800
always meant to be a cultural change and

436
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,840
when we think cultural change we think

437
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,510
people we think tools processes

438
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:42,939
technology governance all of these come

439
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:46,990
together to form a culture now if you go

440
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:50,770
out and you go to a conference that is

441
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:53,560
centered around DevOps you go and you

442
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:56,950
talk to people who this is their primary

443
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,360
focus more often than not the things

444
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:02,770
you're going to hear about are the tools

445
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:07,320
the technology and the processes there

446
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:10,450
is very little focus paid to people and

447
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,419
indeed I went to I did some google

448
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,900
analytics I went out and I investigated

449
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:20,200
in search terms that included dev SEC

450
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:23,490
ops how many of them included the word

451
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,310
tools versus how many included people

452
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:29,970
and there

453
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:33,540
salts are not totally surprising there

454
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:36,140
was about a 700% difference between

455
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:39,210
tools and people in those search terms

456
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:41,160
so people think about tools they think

457
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,800
about automation they think about the CI

458
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,350
CD pipeline and and how do we how do we

459
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,669
make that flow faster and how do we

460
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,010
automate different pieces of that within

461
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:52,860
our builds within our promotions how do

462
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:55,920
we make this all happen people don't

463
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:59,340
really think about the people component

464
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,430
that human factor that is so important

465
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:05,010
when we talk about creating a culture

466
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:08,370
when we think DevOps we think about this

467
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:10,440
we think about that CI CD pipeline how

468
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:15,060
am I gonna make it faster how am I gonna

469
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:17,790
make it stronger it's in the term dev

470
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:19,500
sac ops we think developers we think

471
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,780
security we think operations and

472
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,140
security as I've covered ad nauseam

473
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,520
already tends to get forgotten about

474
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:31,080
because we excluded ourselves from that

475
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:33,960
conversation so if I'm looking to figure

476
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:38,280
out how I'm going to plug security into

477
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,200
this we've heard it preached a million

478
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,120
times push left push left push left

479
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,860
we've got developers pushing right

480
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,409
pushing right pushing right we're giving

481
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,850
them more and more control and we've

482
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,680
created this thing DevOps that brings

483
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:52,169
that developers and operations together

484
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,820
so we're continuing to push developers

485
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,950
farther right they've got things now

486
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,590
there they're implementing technologies

487
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:01,020
like containers and kubernetes clusters

488
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,550
and things of this nature where they've

489
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,080
now got control of the entire

490
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,480
infrastructure on which they're going to

491
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,679
deploy their applications they pushed as

492
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,180
far right as they can go practically so

493
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,670
we in security are still trying to push

494
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:17,100
left we're trying to create this culture

495
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:20,700
of shared responsibility where everybody

496
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:26,010
is responsible for developing and secure

497
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:27,530
software quickly and with stability that

498
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:31,980
steps like ops

499
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:35,790
so for us to keep pushing left we need

500
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:38,400
to continue to keep everything that we

501
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:40,740
do as frictionless as possible for the

502
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,720
developers so I started looking at

503
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,970
threat modeling and how can we push it

504
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:49,320
for the left well what's what's the

505
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:50,820
farthest left we can go well the

506
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,710
furthest left we can go

507
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:57,570
it's that user story right development

508
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:59,970
in dev SCI cop starts with the user

509
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:02,700
story until I take that story off the

510
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:05,340
backlog and I start to develop it the

511
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,020
developer really isn't involved they

512
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,610
might have some role in developing

513
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:13,980
certain user stories and writing these

514
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:16,830
and whatnot but why can't I in this idea

515
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:20,760
of continuous integration continuous

516
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:26,159
development start to implement a model

517
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:31,170
of continuous improvement so instead of

518
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:33,030
taking this gigantic monolithic approach

519
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:36,150
the threat modeling and trying to threat

520
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:38,820
model my entire application what if I

521
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,790
built threat modeling into each user

522
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,220
story

523
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:46,520
and now with each tiny component that

524
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:49,190
I'm going to develop I have threat

525
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:54,050
modeling information right there at the

526
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:56,090
time I take it off the backlog now I sit

527
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:59,720
down with it as a developer I understand

528
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:03,230
what the threats are and I can develop

529
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,270
my code even in a very fast-paced DevOps

530
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:08,510
EIC the environment I can develop my

531
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:11,780
code with the necessary controls in

532
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:14,870
place because I understood the threats

533
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:17,840
from the beginning the minute that story

534
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:21,189
came from the backlog now remember I

535
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:26,120
said people I said focus on people right

536
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:28,940
who's creating these user stories it's

537
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,459
not typically developers it is not

538
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,440
typically the security people it is not

539
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,320
typically your operations people it's

540
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,260
the business people it's the people who

541
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,990
understand how the users are using that

542
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,300
application day in and day out it's the

543
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:47,600
business people that understand how that

544
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:51,129
application applies to the overall

545
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,129
objectives of the organization

546
00:25:52,900 --> 00:26:01,120
they're the ones that we want writing

547
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:03,190
these threat models but if we're gonna

548
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,570
use things like stride and pasta and

549
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,570
dread and we're gonna throw all this

550
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:10,629
technical stuff at it that's not gonna

551
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,700
work so we need to simplify this we need

552
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:15,130
to look at what really matters we're

553
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,250
back to what's the worst thing that

554
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:21,160
could happen hey you want me to create

555
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:23,590
this user story great tell me about that

556
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,140
user story what does that use a story

557
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,820
mean in terms of how we're going to be

558
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,400
attacked what is the worst thing that

559
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:32,800
could happen by us adding this new piece

560
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,290
of functionality this new story to the

561
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:38,560
user experience what is the worst thing

562
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:40,930
that could happen there tell me about

563
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:46,300
that from a business perspective add

564
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:47,980
that to my user story now when I as a

565
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,820
developer I take it off the backlog I

566
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:54,490
have the information not only does it

567
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:56,350
inform my development in terms of

568
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:59,680
creating the right security controls it

569
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:02,500
actually gives me greater context to

570
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,020
understand what it is that I'm creating

571
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,690
how critical it is to the overall

572
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:12,310
application and all of this helps me

573
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:15,070
develop better quicker faster

574
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:16,510
if I understand the threats and I

575
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,179
understand the controls I need to

576
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:21,580
implement any of those automated

577
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,980
security gates we have that occur

578
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,830
downstream in the pipeline I'm better

579
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,680
and able to pass those more easily so

580
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:31,929
now I'm starting to create a more

581
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,940
frictionless environment for my

582
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:36,160
developers and that's what's important

583
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,170
when we want developers to adopt our

584
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:42,460
security initiatives within their dev

585
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:44,710
ops pipeline so how do I simplify this

586
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,720
for the business people well I can tell

587
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,340
you right now we're not doing this

588
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,110
anymore

589
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,720
take these data flow diagrams they go

590
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,490
away we are not looking at this as a

591
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,250
monolithic application we're simplifying

592
00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:01,510
this we want to understand things from

593
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:04,090
the terms of business assets what is it

594
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:06,190
that makes a difference to the business

595
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,840
what is most meaningful from a business

596
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,420
perspective and that's going to be

597
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,370
things like private data certainly if

598
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:15,010
any of us have been watching the news we

599
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:17,320
understand the level to which private

600
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:20,730
data is being exposed being compromised

601
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,730
being sold on the market

602
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:25,499
but being able to deliver critical

603
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:29,249
business functions that's also a

604
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:32,749
business asset just the availability of

605
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:36,329
our application is meaningful in

606
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:39,899
monetary terms in objective terms in

607
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:41,519
tangible terms to the business so we

608
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:44,458
need to be able to identify that when we

609
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,299
talk threats we also have financial

610
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:50,219
assets these are pretty obvious

611
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:53,279
attackers are going to be out to steal

612
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:56,879
money steal things of value from us

613
00:28:53,279 --> 00:29:00,179
beyond just data but what about our

614
00:28:56,879 --> 00:29:03,509
people aren't our people assets to the

615
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:06,809
organization too so isn't it important

616
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:09,829
that we understand how a change how a

617
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:11,489
new users story how that that new

618
00:29:09,829 --> 00:29:13,349
functionality within an application

619
00:29:11,489 --> 00:29:16,079
could also be leveraged to attack our

620
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:18,089
people and how do we design

621
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:21,779
countermeasures then that are going to

622
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:23,158
help us protect those people and then

623
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:24,509
finally of course we have secrets we

624
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,399
have secrets of all kinds that's what

625
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:28,619
business is all about we have trade

626
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,389
secrets we have the secrets that exist

627
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:31,949
within the application itself right

628
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:34,139
we may have passwords we may have keys

629
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:37,409
we may have other things we need to

630
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:41,579
understand how that user story creates

631
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:44,429
or modifies our use of secrets and then

632
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:47,940
we can define and build the necessary

633
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:54,289
controls to defend those secrets as we

634
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:57,089
design our application so now that I

635
00:29:54,289 --> 00:30:02,339
understand those threats and business

636
00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:06,418
terms I can take this massive heavily

637
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:09,239
technical focused stride framework and I

638
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:12,299
can throw that away too we don't need to

639
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:16,349
define things in terms of these

640
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:18,599
technical attack vectors let's think

641
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:22,289
about it differently what are the actual

642
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:24,718
threats if I understand that those are

643
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:27,450
my business assets what are the threats

644
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:30,389
to them the first is probably the one

645
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,540
most of us think about quickest these

646
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:34,370
days it's theft

647
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:38,840
they're going to try to steal something

648
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:42,439
from our organization they might also be

649
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,780
attempting to commit fraud so if I'm

650
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,360
creating a user story that implements

651
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,100
new functionality and new functionality

652
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,679
might be subject to fraudulent

653
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:53,360
transactions that's something I want the

654
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,510
business people to pull out and warn me

655
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,870
about that this is a potential abuse

656
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:01,310
case that an attacker might use of

657
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,850
course exposed data

658
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:07,520
in today's day and age of big data

659
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:09,100
massive stores of information these huge

660
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,690
data leaks that we're using and

661
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:15,040
monetizing that data we've seen the

662
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:17,990
breaches out talked about every day

663
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,629
practically in the media so we know

664
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,100
expose data is an issue so we want the

665
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:24,770
business people to point that out to us

666
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:28,520
where is that data that these attackers

667
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:30,070
may want to expose and then of course

668
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,340
interrupted business

669
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:35,720
there's too many attackers from

670
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,340
nation-state perspectives especially if

671
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,910
I'm in critical infrastructure who want

672
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:44,270
to do us harm just by making our systems

673
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:47,750
unavailable so if this new user story

674
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:51,050
this new component introduces a way that

675
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:52,430
it an attacker might want to come after

676
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:54,649
our application to interrupt that

677
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:57,830
functionality because it's a way that

678
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:59,600
we're delivering a critical function we

679
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:01,939
want the business people to highlight

680
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,649
these and we want them to highlight

681
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:09,650
these in the users story so they're

682
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:10,240
there early for the developers so now we

683
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,700
can

684
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,210
to our developers and say okay it's your

685
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:19,150
turn you've got the information there in

686
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:21,220
front of you we've now set forth for you

687
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:25,300
and understanding of the threats in

688
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:27,850
common everyday terms we're not talking

689
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:30,399
about spoofing we're not talking about

690
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:33,459
denial of service we're talking about

691
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,380
things in everyday terms that any person

692
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,720
can understand

693
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:41,580
so the information is available to you

694
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:44,290
you've been informed now it's up to you

695
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:50,129
as a software developer to implement

696
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:55,120
that within your code so this idea of

697
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:57,820
attack trees same thing it goes away

698
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:03,459
we're not going to ask developers to sit

699
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:07,090
here and Mac pout and attack tree this

700
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:10,180
is time consuming and within the concept

701
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:12,600
or the construct of a specific user

702
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,490
story it's not necessary

703
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,770
we've already illustrated what those

704
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,330
threats look like and we've already

705
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:22,450
given it to you in plain English we

706
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:24,370
don't need a complex attack tree instead

707
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,770
we need to think about security controls

708
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:29,919
a little different let's let's make this

709
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:32,260
simpler and I'm going to tell you as a

710
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,230
developer I want you for each threat

711
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:39,520
that I've identified to implement three

712
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:41,500
types of controls that's it three types

713
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,560
of security controls for each threat

714
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:48,310
that I identified for you the first is a

715
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:52,300
detection control I want you as the

716
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:54,879
developer to enable your code within

717
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,520
that user story to detect the presence

718
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,620
of that type of threat this could be

719
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:05,020
through logging this could be through

720
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:07,510
other means but we want that ability to

721
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:09,840
say this thread is coming at us right

722
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,840
now

723
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,449
next thing we

724
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,010
as we want those mitigation controls so

725
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:18,649
I want a mitigation control now what

726
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,210
what do I really mean we hear the term

727
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:22,820
mitigation a lot when we talk about risk

728
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,400
management and so forth but what do I

729
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,929
mean when I say a mitigation control

730
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,889
what is the purpose of a mitigating

731
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:33,290
control mitigation controls like I

732
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:35,000
showed here using an example from Return

733
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,340
of the Jedi because everybody loves Star

734
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,350
Wars right

735
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:42,200
that shield they put around the

736
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:45,739
Deathstar what was its purpose its

737
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:49,040
purpose was not to completely stop and

738
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:53,659
thwart an attack it was to slow the

739
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:57,050
attackers so that the defenders had time

740
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:59,779
to detect and to respond to that

741
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:02,210
incoming attack so when I talk

742
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,930
mitigation defenses within my

743
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:08,390
applications those controls that I'm

744
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,640
talking about controls that just slow

745
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,819
down and attack things that are going to

746
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:17,359
make it more difficult for that attacker

747
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:20,230
to attack that application things that

748
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:25,360
are going to make it so that I have time

749
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:28,520
to react to that incoming attack and

750
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:31,040
then finally I want them to think about

751
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:34,190
a third set of controls and these are

752
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:37,520
those active defenses so now I've slowed

753
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:40,610
down that attack I forced them to to

754
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,150
hold up and to have to really divides

755
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:46,880
around those mitigation controls while

756
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,890
they're doing that I have the time to

757
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,460
react and I want those controls in place

758
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:54,730
where I can actively shut down that

759
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,920
threat

760
00:35:54,730 --> 00:36:00,310
whether it's disabling a user account

761
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,730
whether it's some form of morphic

762
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:05,799
technology within the application itself

763
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:10,300
how do I go about shutting down that

764
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:13,960
attack I need my developers to build

765
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:18,790
those controls inherently into the

766
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:21,900
application so as I construct these now

767
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:24,490
what we start to do is a couple things

768
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,890
first of all as I said before we've

769
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:29,009
enabled the developers now we've given

770
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:32,020
them this information on the front end

771
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:34,510
we've made it easier for them to design

772
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:37,329
these security controls so that their

773
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,579
code will pass those later stages that

774
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:42,609
might hold up their build or might hold

775
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:44,829
up their pull requests later on because

776
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:49,000
of a security issue they've been able to

777
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:53,079
identify it early a nice offshoot of

778
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,619
this because we've started to design

779
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:59,710
security controls now with the assets in

780
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:02,319
mind is that we start to move away from

781
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:05,020
this traditional approach of security

782
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:08,650
design if we look at security design

783
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:10,750
since 1960 when we implemented our first

784
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:13,000
password-protected system we've always

785
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,890
looked at security from the outside in

786
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,839
as security practitioners we talked

787
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,629
about it right that crunchy outer

788
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:22,270
exterior and then that legally middle

789
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:26,140
that's soft and easy to attack once

790
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:28,569
people have broken that perimeter well

791
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:31,000
when I take threat modeling and I start

792
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:34,680
to design my controls around those

793
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,829
assets I now start to do this inside-out

794
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:41,980
security design I now have an asset

795
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:45,069
centric security design where my

796
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:47,170
strongest security controls start at the

797
00:37:45,069 --> 00:37:49,810
assets that matter most the things I

798
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:52,810
have to defend the most and then they

799
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:54,520
build out from there that's how I want

800
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,990
to design security whether I'm talking

801
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,020
about networks whether I'm talking about

802
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:01,779
applications regardless of what the

803
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:04,810
scope is that's how I should be looking

804
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:08,320
at my security controls so this form of

805
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:11,140
threat modeling enables that it

806
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,090
it's a completely new culture and then

807
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:17,020
finally because it's made things so much

808
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:21,360
easier for developers this is how I

809
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:24,790
bring security into a dev SEC ops

810
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:27,280
pipeline I've now created something

811
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:30,220
that's frictionless I've now created

812
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,360
something that helps my developers I've

813
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,549
now created something that the

814
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,100
developers eventually as they start to

815
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:40,180
see the benefits from this will actually

816
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:42,549
want to implement they actually want to

817
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,250
be a part of this because it makes their

818
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:47,680
lives easier developers want to create

819
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,270
secure code but they don't want people

820
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,279
standing in their way and preventing

821
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:53,740
them from being able to code quickly to

822
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,090
create new cool exciting features and

823
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,439
things that address the needs of their

824
00:38:55,090 --> 00:39:03,400
users so this is how we can plug in as

825
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,260
security practitioners so before I wrap

826
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,600
things up I want to leave you with this

827
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,210
quote and unfortunately I haven't been

828
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,910
able to find attribution for it but we

829
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:15,120
cannot change where we're headed by

830
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:18,310
doing the same things that got us here

831
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:21,009
since 1961 with that first password

832
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:23,500
control password protected system we've

833
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:26,350
been thinking about security as a

834
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:30,010
bolt-on we've looked at security as this

835
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:34,460
thing that we have to inject forcibly

836
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:37,130
into development into operations

837
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:39,380
deaf sack ops has taught us we have to

838
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:41,510
think about it differently we have to

839
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,400
build a culture where we as security

840
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:45,109
practitioners accept that we are

841
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,480
responsible for code getting the

842
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:49,009
production quickly we are responsible

843
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,160
for the stability of that code

844
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:53,900
throughout yes the developers the

845
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,430
operations folks they are also they

846
00:39:53,900 --> 00:40:00,140
share responsibility with us in terms of

847
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:01,580
making sure that software is secure

848
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,118
making sure that infrastructure is

849
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:07,220
secure we're all in this together but we

850
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,010
have to change how we think about

851
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:12,618
security how we think about what we do

852
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:15,980
in terms of threat modeling and other

853
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:18,830
controls and make it something that

854
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:21,770
enables our developers something that

855
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:25,790
creates to borrow a term from Netflix

856
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:28,310
that paved road for how they get from

857
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:31,820
development to production with the least

858
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:33,830
amount of resistance possible this

859
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:37,970
approach the threat modeling is one of

860
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:41,810
the key ways we can start to do that so

861
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:44,330
as I wrap things up I want to invite you

862
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:45,830

day-to-day but let's talk careers things

877
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,270
of that nature are more that that

886
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:40,580
time as well and then finally I

887
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:44,020
mentioned before I have my website my

888
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:46,520
blog you can go out there Alisa SEC comm

889
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:48,200
not only do I post my blog out there

890
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:51,040
this is also where I post my

891
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,240
speaking engagements of course right now

892
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,190
some of those are limited because a lot

893
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:58,250
of them have gone virtual but that's

894
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:00,740
okay I still as an advocate I stayed

895
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:05,480
very active I still want to interact

896
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:07,160
with the community and so I'm happy to

897
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,310
do so through any of those means and I

898
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,950
really do invite you to get in touch

899
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:15,430
with me and let me know what you think

900
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:18,770
let me know what questions you have I'm

901
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:22,910
very happy to have these conversations

902
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:25,670
with you moving forward so with that I

903
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:28,310
want to say thank you on behalf of

904
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:32,000
myself on behalf behalf of besides

905
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:35,240
Atlanta and also on behalf of my

906
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,570
organization sneek always happy to have

907
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,368
further conversation with you folks and

908
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:43,310
to really talk about how do we make dev

909
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:45,920
SEC ops a reality for us we've been

910
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:48,078
dealing with this for better than 10

911
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,480
years and security still is that

912
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,420
forgotten element so let's see what we

913
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,329
can do to make it better and with that I

914
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:59,960
think we have time and the facility for

915
00:42:56,329 --> 00:43:02,210
questions so I will open up the floor if

916
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,970
there's things either from the moderator

917
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:12,980
or things that you guys have in slack

918
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:16,029
I'm gonna take a look here see if I can

919
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,030
get my controls back

920
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:34,980
so there's a question here aren't those

921
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:37,020
terms that I showed in the Stride slide

922
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:41,490
deck part of the common body of

923
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:45,180
knowledge yes when as your follow up

924
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:46,259
there as we're speaking in cissp terms

925
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,000
yeah

926
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,270
but that's exactly the problem they're

927
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,250
known to us in the security community

928
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:56,130
outside of the security community when I

929
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:58,080
talk to developers they don't

930
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:00,920
necessarily know what those terms mean

931
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:03,150
and that's what I'm trying to change

932
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,820
when I talk about those businesspeople

933
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:09,960
who now are the ones that are writing

934
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:11,760
these user stories they definitely don't

935
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,400
understand what all those terms mean and

936
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,790
trying to apply those very technically

937
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,400
focused terms to the development process

938
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:23,160
is what becomes very cumbersome now it's

939
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,260
I have to have a trained cissp for

940
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,000
instance be a part of that threat

941
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,650
modeling approach in order to make sense

942
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,240
of it because I'm trying to apply a

943
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:36,990
stride in dread and so forth and so you

944
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:39,240
know in in this case yeah it's common to

945
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:41,370
us but we need to start to have that

946
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,689
empathy for the wider organization and

947
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:45,150
understand that they don't understand

948
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:46,560
those terms and so by making it easier

949
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,240
for them especially if I'm going to ask

950
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,160
them to bring threat modeling to the

951
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,109
user story I need to give them something

952
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,730
simpler something that has business

953
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:59,130
context and something that has more

954
00:44:53,730 --> 00:45:00,810
plain language application let's see so

955
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,280
without the fancy tree killing

956
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:06,210
deliverables what are the effective

957
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:08,040
deliverables for the one above that as

958
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:11,220
trench workers can easily produce and

959
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,230
deliver in this new model so thinking in

960
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,640
terms of metrics right because that's

961
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,960
ultimately what do we have the

962
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,150
deliverables for there so what we have

963
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,940
metrics your first deliverable is just

964
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:23,220
being able to identify within the user

965
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,480
story itself when I say identify this in

966
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,879
the user story I'm literally talking

967
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,060
about changing your templates if it's in

968
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,250
JIRA go into JIRA and set up one to two

969
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,110
to three questions that just address

970
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:37,050
things like what are the critical assets

971
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:38,880
that are part of this user story what

972
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:41,099
are the specific threats

973
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,970
and there is a training component to

974
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:43,829
this right if you're gonna ask

975
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,480
businesspeople to do this you do at

976
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:47,640
least want them to understand what the

977
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,099
expectations are so that's your first

978
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:53,670
deliverable is just having that

979
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:57,359
information in that user story now on

980
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:59,430
the flip side of that most development

981
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:04,019
organizations even a dev psych ops model

982
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:06,660
there is some promotion documentation

983
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:08,669
that's required right so developers in

984
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,558
some way are documenting what they've

985
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:12,809
done within a user story so where I've

986
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,609
seen that implemented is just it's a

987
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:17,279
quick couple statements here are the

988
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:20,940
controls that I implemented in response

989
00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:23,160
to these particular threats that were

990
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,269
identified in the user story so it's

991
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:28,649
kind of that that post implementation

992
00:46:24,269 --> 00:46:30,598
piece and so that's all you need from a

993
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:32,670
deliverable deliverables perspective

994
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,170
because now you can demonstrate the

995
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:36,210
threats that you identified you can

996
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:38,309
identify the controls that you

997
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,859
implemented and as a result you have

998
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:43,019
measurable metrics that start to speak

999
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:44,490
to what you're doing in terms of

1000
00:46:43,019 --> 00:46:46,558
addressing security within that

1001
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:48,629
application so now when you elevate that

1002
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,670
to security leaders to business leaders

1003
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:52,680
they can see that and they can see the

1004
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:56,490
tangible results that that is having

1005
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:58,490
within the security of that application

1006
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:00,549
you

1007
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,549
you

1008
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,640
okay I don't know are there any other

1009
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,640
questions

1010
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,150
see a couple people typing so I'm going

1011
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:12,609
to wait for just a moment what do you

1012
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,950
think about the step of moving

1013
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:18,120
user stories so in code review the code

1014
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:21,310
reviewers can assert that on the face

1015
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:25,089
that the developer did XYZ yes exactly

1016
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:26,950
so kind of to the the point that I was

1017
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:30,730
just making in terms of deliverables and

1018
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:33,069
so forth you want the user story to be

1019
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:34,780
something that continues throughout if

1020
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:37,330
we look at the way user stories are used

1021
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:39,310
today not only do they inform the

1022
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,720
development but they also inform the

1023
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:44,410
testing right we're gonna write use

1024
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,629
cases and indeed long term some of those

1025
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:49,540
use cases will become regression test

1026
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:52,120
use cases but things that are informing

1027
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:53,860
our test cycles on the back end so where

1028
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,069
I've got threat information in there

1029
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:59,830
those are now test cases that I can

1030
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:03,160
write that become a part of my test set

1031
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:04,569
as well so taking that user story then

1032
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:08,819
and populating it throughout the

1033
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:11,500
pipeline becomes crucial to this and

1034
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,480
where I've seen organizations that have

1035
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,000
gotten really good at this what they're

1036
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,470
able to do is just like they've done

1037
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,180
with other test cases where they have

1038
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:24,250
automated user story formation into a

1039
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:25,480
test case within their test suite you

1040
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,970
can do the same thing with the threat

1041
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,750
information start to look at how do we

1042
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:34,680
define those test cases that are going

1043
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:37,990
to test for the exposures of that data

1044
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:42,660
via the the threats that we identified

1045
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:42,660
and so that can be very powerful as well

1046
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:59,769
okay thank you Kevin that's a very

1047
00:48:57,229 --> 00:49:04,848
awesome to hear that and yeah that's

1048
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:09,169
bringing it to those layman's terms is

1049
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:11,119
crucial it's how we enable I've in

1050
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:13,009
certain conversations when I've talked

1051
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,930
about extending this idea of DevOps

1052
00:49:13,009 --> 00:49:17,150
culture to the business side I've

1053
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:19,489
actually I've used the term and then

1054
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:21,410
cringed I've said bizdev psych ops I

1055
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:24,259
don't want to get into that emotion of

1056
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:28,609
constantly adding new three-letter terms

1057
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:31,160
to that already lengthy term but it is

1058
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:32,420
it's important right to to have this

1059
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,729
culture where everybody in the

1060
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:37,940
organization has that sense of some

1061
00:49:34,729 --> 00:49:40,129
shared responsibility and bringing a

1062
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,219
threat modeling into plain language

1063
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:45,559
that's in the user story is a great way

1064
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:48,229
to tie in the business side and to

1065
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:50,900
really get them to experience their

1066
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:54,850
their capability to affect the overall

1067
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,910
security posture of the applications

1068
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,910
you

1069
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:01,810
all right well I think we're good I

1070
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:06,910

1071
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:08,799
so I will I will stop the the

1072
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,960
conversation here but I will stay in the

1073
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,880
slack for a while to interact with you

1074
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,390
