127
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,130
minutes to drop drop the pin in the map

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,720
so that we know where you were hanging

129
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:56,120
out with us today from next a couple

130
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,169
weeks ago we thought we were going to be

131
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,789
physical we

132
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,080
we're gonna have this great plan to hand

133
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:01,699
out t-shirts we're gonna have t-shirts

134
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,400
for everybody and that was going to be a

135
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:06,949
thing right and then the world stood on

136
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,650
its head and we had to spin this thing

137
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:12,499
up into a virtual format with less than

138
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:16,758
almost less than two weeks notice and it

139
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:17,990
has been a challenge but one that I

140
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,300
think that we have successfully

141
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,900
navigated but one of the things that we

142
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,330
communicated to our personal sponsors

143
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:30,169
was that we were not going to be able to

144
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:33,110
handle t-shirts we just simply were not

145
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,309
equipped to handle that in in thinking

146
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,800
about everything else that we need to

147
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:38,598
get done along the way and so we gave

148
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,630
you an opportunity to ask for a refund

149
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,750
no questions asked we understood and we

150
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:48,769
had almost 300 sponsored personal

151
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:53,449
sponsors and less than 15 less than 20

152
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:57,110
left us and so a thank you for that and

153
00:08:53,449 --> 00:09:00,199
B we had a t-shirt company reach out to

154
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,750
us and offer a solution and so we

155
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:05,870
believe that what we're going to be able

156
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:08,300
to offer everybody in two groups and

157
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,519
listen carefully now is that one of the

158
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,640
perks of being a personal sponsor was

159
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,709
that you would get a t-shirt we think

160
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,529
that we have worked that out and we will

161
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:21,349
be communicating with you how to do that

162
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:22,910
in the forthcoming week or so a couple

163
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,720
of weeks probably to get this all stood

164
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:29,769
up but what we will be relying on is the

165
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,839
email address that you punched into Tito

166
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:35,750
to place your ticket order as a personal

167
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:38,990
sponsor and so if that is not an email

168
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,760
address that you frequently check please

169
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,890
do keep an eye on it

170
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,680
because we will be pushing details out

171
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:48,260
about that and how you can go about

172
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,630
getting the shirt that is part of your

173
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,220

plan for you as well we are going to be

177
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:05,480
standing up a virtual webstore where

178
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:09,019
anybody can purchase the t-shirt for

179

192
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,140
looking at adding a number of items in

193
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,089
the virtual webstore and so good lord

194

196
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:55,640
good lord so we we will be working to

197
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,600
make that available for you the next

198
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,819
couple of weeks also please do not walk

199
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,970
away from the slack workspace we've had

200
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,700
a great deal of fun in here today but we

201
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:11,020
actually knew this is not just a one-off

202
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:13,280
type thing to get us through the day we

203
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,689
we envisioned this as a way to stay

204
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:20,270
connected with you nice folks globally

205
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:22,310
throughout the year and so whether we do

206
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,199
this virtually next year or not whether

207
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,209
we do it in person or not whether we do

208
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,890
a hybrid a lot of decisions to be made

209
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,589
we're nowhere near making those

210
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:33,260
decisions yet but we want to stay

211
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,780
connected with you and one of the things

212
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,089
that we have talked about doing is

213
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,339
hosting webinars throughout the year

214
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:45,260
we're in the very early planning stages

215
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:46,730
of that it seems that the I think

216
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,790
everybody would agree the zoom worked

217
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,220
pretty well and so we think that we see

218
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,680
some opportunity here who wants socks

219
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,580
we're not getting socks in the stop it

220
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:05,959
we're not getting socks well maybe maybe

221
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:12,800
we'll get a socks I don't know no stocks

222
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:14,930
no definitely no stocks charlie no we're

223
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:20,839
working on it we're moving in that

224
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:23,290
direction so we we need to hit the

225
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,530
drawing board and figure out what these

226
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,120
intermediate

227
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:29,209
events might look like on a much smaller

228
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,380
scale but understand that is something

229
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,790
that we're looking at and one of the

230
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,550
ways that we will communicate will be

231
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:38,150
through the slack workspace another will

232
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,709
be through our Twitter account that's oh

233
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:52,490
wait oh good lord

234
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:53,930
Elvis stop it I'm just gonna stop so yes

235
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,200
I will sell my you socks queue

236
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:59,479
absolutely yes I will

237
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,220
so now we're just getting silly now it's

238
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,950
the end of the day it's been a long day

239
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,380
so just keep we've got a lot of things

240
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,330
cooking and we've got now that the

241
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,120
pressures off of us with today and

242
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,650
getting through today I think that I

243
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,030
think we all agree we've had some

244
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,860
conversations internally that there are

245
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,270
some real opportunities here and we

246
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,120
would like to see how we can capitalize

247
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:22,579
on that to maybe not just make b-sides a

248
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,610
once-a-year thing especially in Atlanta

249
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,430
so we'll see what that looks like we

250
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,870
will be in touch

251
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:33,500
keep an eye on the slack workspace keep

252
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:35,090
an eye on Twitter and I am I am just

253
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,930
gonna stop talking now because I am

254
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:46,100
tired and I want a cigar and a glass of

255
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:48,620

person and in less than a week had to

262
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,610
quickly pivot and start looking at other

263
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:09,670
options and we spent a lot of time on

264
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:32,260
calls and you know going sorry

265
