1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:10,480
good morning everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:12,339
b-sides Atlanta 2020 we are so glad to

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,429
have all of you here today and we hope

4
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:17,350
that you will find some benefit from our

5
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:20,110
talks and all the effort that we have

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,140
put in in the background it has

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,900
certainly been a very interesting ten

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,850
days and we are nowhere near where we

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,430
thought we would be when we when we

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,710
started planning months ago that

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:35,109
obviously fate has dictated that we move

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,929
in the virtual direction which meant

13
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:40,629
that that as organizers we had to make

14
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:43,749
some very quick movements and some very

15
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:46,178
quick decisions and we we appreciate

16
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:49,539
everybody's patience and everybody's

17
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:51,460
willingness to help and support it to

18
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:54,280
help try and pull this thing off in

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:57,429
basically less than less than two weeks

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,670
we went from having a physical presence

21
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:03,609
at the KSU center on campus at Kennesaw

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:07,810
State University in Atlanta and we are

23
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:10,210
now here virtual and so what I would

24
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,579
like to do before we go any further is

25
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:16,000
to just give you some some facts and

26
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:17,229
give you some numbers the first number

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,280
that I want to give I'm not going to

28
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:22,229
show it to you but I'm going to I'm

29

going back to our our global presence

104
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:38,460
today if you will very last minute we

105
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:40,470
were actually able to set up a map and

106
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,099
throughout the day we would like for you

107
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,199
to drop a virtual pen to show us where

108
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,900
you're coming to the conference from

109
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,820
we'll get the we'll get the map link

110
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,909
post it on the website and we will also

111
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,699
post it in the announcements channel on

112
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,419
slack and that brings me to slack if

113
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:02,070
you're not in slack you need to be there

114
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:05,159
as the webinars go on throughout the day

115
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:08,460
we have disabled QA functionality in

116
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,490
zoom and we want everybody to interact

117
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,340
via the via the slack workspace and to

118
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,139
join slack you can find the link to do

119
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,929
that on the front page of our website

120
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,690
and you will also be able to find direct

121
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,860
links to all of those zoom webinars that

122
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,050
we're running today we're gonna have

123
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,310
four different tracks running throughout

124
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,570
the day I'm gonna grab a piece of paper

125
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,560
here we are currently in the I got to

126
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,789
get this right sorry

127
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,500
the connect track and the schedule for

128
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:39,900
all the talks is available on the

129
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,430
website but we've got the connect track

130
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,489
that's where we are today we are also

131
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,860
running the detect track I am the host

132
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:50,190
for that track and then we are running

133
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,229
the protect track also and Patrick

134
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,849
Sanders is the host for that track we

135
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:56,700
also have the fourth track which is the

136
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:59,630
CTF and miscellaneous track enjoy idle

137
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,639
the shore where it is hosting that one

138
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:06,090
so the idea here is that we're going to

139
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,530
stream all the talks through zoom and

140
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,659
all the presenters will come in through

141
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,820
zoom but there won't be any Q&A or

142
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,130
interaction via zoom we want everything

143
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,139
to run via the slack workspace that

144
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,150
we've created I'm gesturing because on

145
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,910
my second monitor over here that's where

146
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:23,729
I've got my slack application up and

147
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,530
running but we've got a lot of different

148
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:27,570
channels in a slack workspace we've got

149
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:31,289
channels dedicated to each one of the

150
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:33,900

about everything that I need to mention

184
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:01,320
I'm gonna look over here I'm looking at

185
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,349
my organizers on a slack Channel did I

186
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:08,550
miss anything Matt Joetta you that

187
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:09,990
Patrick did I miss anything you minute

188
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,180
here I'm waiting to see if they post

189
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,990
anything in the slack and it's like

190
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,469
Patrick is typing the wonders of the

191
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,940
wonders of a virtual conference

192
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:24,150
okay so I've gotten a high sign from

193
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,800
from everybody I think I mentioned this

194
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:29,099
but just in case I didn't the webinars

195
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,700
are our captive 500 seats so each

196
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:34,679
webinar has 500 seats like I said we

197
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,500
that ridiculously high number of

198
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:40,049
attendees we have registered could lead

199
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,839
to a situation where there are no seats

200
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:45,180
in the webinar not to fear we have set

201
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,790
up live-streaming for each one of the

202
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,520
tracks via twitch TV and if you cannot

203
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:53,099
get into the webinar for any reason then

204
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,470
go back to the website besides ATL dot

205
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,220

206
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,100

208

210
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:09,420

219

220

editing service to take the video that

221
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,719

222
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:40,620

bring today that was one thing I forgot

232
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:06,660
to tell you we tripled our CFP

233
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,309
submissions this year and we had a

234
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,930
double-blind review process the

235
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:11,279
submitters don't know who the reviewers

236
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,219
were and the viewers don't know who the

237
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,889
submitters were and I had at least two

238
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,879
sets of eyes on every CFP submission and

239
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:23,879
so I want to thank each and one of my

240
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:26,879
more than 25 reviewers that we had this

241
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,040
year we could not have done this without

242
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,779
your help and so thank you all very much

243
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,000
as well and I'll be following up with

244
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,649
you privately but on some things that

245
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,689
we're gonna do for you to express our

246
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:38,689
gratitude okay enough of me talking
