1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,000
so Mike's going to be talking to us

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:12,920
about our resumes and just a personal

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,840
tidbit some of the best advice I ever

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,320
got was to make sure that my resume is

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,140
always ready um because you never know

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,698
when your dream role will present itself

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,130
and you don't want to be scrambling

8
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,589
trying to put together your resume and

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,359
let a week or two or a month goodbye I'm

10
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:31,698
trying to give a resume of myself

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,500
anyways and I turn over to you Mike feel

12
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,300
free there you go and feel free to

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,629
present yourself and floods or whatever

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,910
else you would like to talk about so as

15
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:43,699
I said advance business engineering it's

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:46,760
my company I'm an IT recruiter I've got

17
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:49,280
over 20 years of experience recruiting

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,030
been doing a lot of security and cyber

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,109
security

20
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,760
recruiting last couple of years as I

21
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:57,230
said I'm a beekeeper this is the current

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,010
state of my backyard with all of my

23
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:04,039
hives and Thursday afternoon some of my

24
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,870
hives swarmed and a couple thousand bees

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,610
that I had to put up in a box and catch

26
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,650
and I guess one of them was still mad at

27
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,510
me last night when I was in the backyard

28
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,370
and decided to sting me between the eyes

29
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,410
so I woke up this morning with my face

30
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,770
pretty swollen and my family picking on

31
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,770
me pretty good

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,970
so resume highlights and you bet you

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,670
made a couple of good points this

34
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:28,970
morning that I was going to get to one

35
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,490
of them is you need to work on keeping

36
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,860
your resume updated I recommend people

37
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,410
do it at once every six months or once a

38
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,210
year I've talked to a number of people

39
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,860
that have been caught in layoffs they

40
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,839
hadn't touched their resume in a couple

41
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,480
of years and they find it a daunting

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,550
task to have to go back and figure out

43
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,010
the various jobs that they might have

44
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,289
been promoted from and up through and

45
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,090
they find it a daunting job to go back

46
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,700
and remember what tasks they had to do

47
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,800
it also allows you that if you are

48
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,510
caught in a situation like you that

49
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,539
talked about this morning in her keynote

50
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,940
if you are caught in a surprising layoff

51
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,520
it allows you to pivot rather quickly

52
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,800
with your resume or if a new opportunity

53
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,900
comes to you out of surprise it allows

54
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,719
you to get your resume over someone

55
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,430
rather quickly so to your vets points

56
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,340
absolute

57
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,799
keeping your resume updated is something

58
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,640
that I recommend

59
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:26,980
so resume formatting on the internet a

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,290
lot of f-style reading has been talked

61
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,899
about and that's what a lot of people do

62
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,629
with their resume and it is a good way

63
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,700
to format your resume you can look up F

64
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,108
style formatting or reading formatting

65
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,899
if you want to see what that's like

66
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:42,849
so you need to use clear headings and

67
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,139
subheadings that are bolded I recommend

68
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:49,929
objective experience education skills

69
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:51,310
and bold those highlight those so resume

70
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,489
readers know exactly where to go and

71
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,859
find that information bullet points are

72
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,590
an easy format they allow people to read

73
00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:02,500
very clearly and easily on all devices

74
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,829
we're all looking at resumes and

75
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,569
everything on all devices now so

76
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:10,599
sometimes when people are tired if it's

77
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:13,260
paragraph formatted it's just really

78
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,179
hard to read on a smaller device

79
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,879
straight to the point writing cut any

80
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,940
kind of unnecessary clutter that bogs a

81
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,679
reader down I think we all have been

82
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,150
reading something and when you get to

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,459
the end of a sentence or halfway through

84
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,199
a paragraph you don't understand what

85
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,120
you've read and you have to go back and

86
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,609
reread something or start over to see

87
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,709
what somebody was saying so you need to

88
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:37,750
make sure that you don't have any kind

89
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:40,090
of clutter or writing that's going to

90
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,970
bog somebody down they say you have

91
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,709
about 30 seconds to grab someone's

92
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,659
attention

93
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,400
hiring managers that I talked to they

94
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,168
need to hire they know they need to hire

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,459
but it's something that they don't enjoy

96
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:56,500
doing so if a manager is frustrated with

97
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,259
your resume if it's not making sense to

98
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:03,220
them they will pass on it and they will

99
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:05,349
move on to the next person name phone

100
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,389
number email address city and state zip

101
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:09,040
code you do not need to put your

102
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:12,849
physical address anymore and it'll also

103
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,638
help you save some space I recommend

104
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:17,738
that you put an objective on your resume

105
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,440
one to three sentences about the type of

106
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:23,859
opportunity that you're seeking this

107
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,659
does help if your resume is separated

108
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,060
from a cover letter and if you're going

109
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:29,360
into an applicant tracking system most

110
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,919
likely you can

111
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,800
on the fact that your cover letter will

112
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,330
be separated from your resume and then

113
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,639
that way if it's pulled up internally

114
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,530
later someone can see what kind of a

115
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,439
opportunity or objective that you're

116
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:45,020
after I do recommend that everybody

117
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,449
write a cover letter I do recommend that

118
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,270
you write a cover letter to every single

119
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:52,819
opportunity and you can't be lazy about

120
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:55,370
it I get people that will send me a

121
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:57,289
resume with the cover letter and they've

122
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,969
left the cover letter written to an

123
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:03,020
opportunity that they were applying to

124
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:04,789
previous to me if you do that to HR or

125
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,310
if you do that to a hiring manager

126
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:10,400
it just looks lazy and it is a very

127
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,840
quick turn off it just doesn't say much

128
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,599
about your follow-through and your

129
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,669
attention to detail and I think in

130
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:18,889
security you need to be attention to

131
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,529
detail oriented and so you need to make

132
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:23,569
sure that you are writing a cover letter

133
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:25,400
for everyone and make sure that you're

134
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:28,340
doing it correctly

135
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,650
a skill section this can be very

136
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:34,179
important for a couple of reasons number

137
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:37,940
one you can highlight specific skills

138
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:41,449
hardware software tools that you want to

139
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,940
bring attention to it can also act as a

140
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:46,370
keyword database if your resume gets

141
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:51,050
uploaded into an applicant tracking

142
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:54,830
system or on the dice or anywhere you

143
00:05:51,050 --> 00:06:01,339
know indeed monster so that can also act

144
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:04,669
as a keyword search bank experience you

145
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:06,020
need to clearly lay out each job that

146
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:07,849
you've had you need to put your

147
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,500
employers name unless you need to keep

148
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:11,688
that confidential which I understand

149
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,180
that happens sometimes you need to put

150
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:17,240
your title you need to clearly late your

151
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,339
label your dates of employment you need

152
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,529
to give meaningful content and an

153
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:24,139
explanation of your job responsibilities

154
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:27,349
and again as something that you've

155
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:30,259
talked to this morning you only list

156
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:33,438
skills and experience that you can speak

157
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:36,099
to in an interview I had a gentleman who

158
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:40,219
must have put every single piece of

159
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:42,979
security hardware tool and software that

160
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:43,550
they ran in his organization managers

161
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:45,469
started

162
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,960
in questions he could not answer to half

163
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,940
of them it really turned the interview

164
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,609
negative on both sides because he felt

165
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,130
like he wasn't doing well so please

166
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:58,150
represent yourself as you are that way

167
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:01,370
you just you can answer those questions

168
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:03,530
you need to have are a cues in your

169
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,540
experience and what are are a cues one

170
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,760
is our as responsibilities

171
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,470
what were your day-to-day what were your

172
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,530
month-to-month and what were your annual

173
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:15,110
responsibilities actions you need to

174
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,780
give action to what you did to carry out

175
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,280
those responsibilities and Q is

176
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,010
quantification and this might be

177
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,989
percentages or numbers that give actions

178
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,130
to something that you did measurable it

179
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,870
could be the number of servers that

180
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,300
you're responsible for the number of

181
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,900
endpoints that were protected systems

182
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,580
upgraded performance increase if you're

183
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,530
a manager or moving up you might have

184
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,200
budget responsibilities the team size

185
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:42,940
manage quantification just gives numbers

186
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,940
that people can sink their teeth into

187
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,010
education obviously you need lists

188
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,340
you're a college or university and the

189
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:55,520
degree obtained do not put graduation

190
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,729
dates you don't want to allow someone to

191
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,710
age you it does happen it's really hard

192
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,210
to get it out of your mind even for me

193
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,000
when I try to walk away from it

194
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,700
sometimes you know younger managers want

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,650
younger people on their team but when

196
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,200
you see a date of graduation sometimes

197
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,210
it's really hard but you do not need to

198
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,370
give someone the ability to aid you so

199
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,530
no graduation dates on there

200
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,630
I'm also old school like I said I've

201
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,030
been doing this over 20 years I only

202
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,130
like to see a college and degree listed

203
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,539
when you've obtained it I'm not fan of

204
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,300
putting university on there because you

205
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,190
took just some classes that has gotten

206
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,960
me in trouble before it was my fault I

207
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,820
forgot to ask somebody on their resume

208
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,880
if they did finish their college

209
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,090
education it came back on the employment

210
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,640
check that the person did not finish

211
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,200
their college education and then I had

212
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,990
to do a lot of explaining jumping around

213
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,660
we were able to secure the job for the

214
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,190
person but it was a lot of explaining to

215
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,770
do why it looked like he had a college

216
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,270
education and he didn't so I've just I'm

217
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,980
a fan of not putting it if you don't

218
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,600
have it

219
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,240
certifications obviously in security all

220
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,050
of your certifications that you have

221
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,940
need to be listed and the ones that are

222
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,410
relevant to you some of the ones people

223
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,090
don't put on there that you know have

224
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,360
expired or they don't want to keep up

225
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:17,160
anymore that's obviously okay but if

226
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,550
there is one that maybe you held in the

227
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:23,130
past that might be relevant to a job

228
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,839
that you're trying to get now you can

229
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,490
put that on there in my opinion I think

230
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:32,310
it does help show that you've jumped

231
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:35,010
through that hoop in the past spell

232
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,260
check your resume I leave spellcheck

233
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,630
alone on my word Docs and so when the

234
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,069
resume comes over to me and there are a

235
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:45,180
ton of red lines underneath words

236
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,590
obviously it doesn't catch all

237
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,270
spellcheck doesn't catch certain

238
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,370
software and hardware and stuff like

239
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,990
that and that's understandable but when

240
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,210
it's throughout the resume in other

241
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,490
places it's a pretty quick turn off a

242
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,910
lot of the people that I work with in HR

243
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,380
it's a really big turn-off for them

244
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:04,020
grammar check your resume whether you

245
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,720
put it in grammerly or whatever you need

246
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,819
to be reading your resume I say we

247
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,420
reread and reread your resume for

248
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,890
grammar and ease of reading again you

249
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,510
have less than 30 seconds to catch

250
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:20,250
someone's attention and so if it doesn't

251
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:21,750
flow they will move on after you're done

252
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,790
and you feel like you're pretty secure

253
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,350
with your resume and happy with it have

254
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,819
your spouse or your girlfriend or your

255
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:29,130
boyfriend your friend your mom your dad

256
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,710
somebody that was willing to read the

257
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,540
resume have them read it be willing to

258
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,210
take their criticism to heart and make

259
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,650
the corrections that they suggest a lot

260
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,930
of times would get really attached to

261
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,610
our work and we take criticism talk

262
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,530
you're really hard but I think that

263
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:47,460
other people's opinions would really

264
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:49,589
really really help again a lot of people

265
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,330
stress about their resume and I don't

266
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,130
think it's something you have to stress

267
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,590
about I say just make it a work in

268
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:59,460
progress work on it a little bit each

269
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,660
day again I talked to some people that

270
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,810
have been laid off they've been in a

271
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,819
company for 15 years or 20 years and it

272
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:09,300
is a really daunting task to have to

273
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,529
redo a resume so if you can keep it

274
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,258
updated

275
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:15,600
once or twice a year it really does help

276
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:17,129
and it's not such a daunting task and it

277
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,779
really will help you pivot to a new

278
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:22,649
opportunity if someone comes to you with

279
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,999
one or if you're laid off length of

280
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,649
resume is something that's pretty

281
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:27,749
subjective to a lot of different people

282
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:29,670
a lot of managers don't like long

283
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:31,410
resumes they don't have the time to read

284
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,050
them so if you have less than three

285
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,430
years of work experience maybe three to

286
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,430
five you probably should keep your

287
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,349
resume to one page if you have more than

288
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,989
three or five years of experience you

289
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,999
can go to two pages in length I don't

290
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,009
get offended if I see a three-page

291
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:49,350
resume I'm okay with that person has had

292
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:52,139
multiple contracts or has gone through

293
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,809
multiple opportunities or maybe someone

294
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:56,519
who is a senior level manager and needs

295
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:59,219
to show that progression of job

296
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,649
experience I can see it going to three

297
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,800
pages I don't really see any reason why

298
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,240
someone needs to go past three pages

299
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,349
it's just too long and people don't want

300
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,569
to read that much so if you're looking

301
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:16,050
for an internship and you don't have a

302
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:17,519
lot of experience a lot of people say

303
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,529
you know they just don't have work

304
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,689
experience what should someone list and

305
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:24,750
how should they do it I recently helped

306
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:27,149
a friend of mine son who all he's ever

307
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,879
done is work in an insurance firm as a

308
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:32,370
clerk he was a developer he was coming

309
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:36,000
out he was graduating from Kennesaw we

310
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:39,480
put the insurance clerking on the bottom

311
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,899
then we moved his project experience up

312
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,920
and we made his resume extremely heavy

313
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:51,240
on the development projects and courses

314
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,729
that he took at KSU and that helped him

315
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,290
secure an internship then once we did

316
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,870
that we were able to expand on the

317
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:00,599
internship and put a lot of experience

318
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,279
and depth around that and that helped

319
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,870
him move into a new position which he

320
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,170
secured by the time he was already done

321
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:09,179
with his internship to a new company so

322
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,759
I would draw attention to any kind of

323
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:14,399
applicable courses that you have worked

324
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,339
on or programmed in or done in security

325
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,629
if you run a home lab I would put that

326
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,170
on there whether you are a professional

327
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:24,030
or not that gives you some extra depth

328
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,939
outside of work

329
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,890
that shows that you do other things

330
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,360
outside of work or it shows tools that

331
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,030
you've worked with or projects that

332
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,890
you've done a lot of managers like

333
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,689
seeing if you've got home lab stuff on

334
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:44,370
their side projects that you've worked

335
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:47,180
on so moving over to LinkedIn since that

336
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:51,540
kind of goes obviously with the resume

337
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:53,400
and one of the things that a resume and

338
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,010
your LinkedIn profile should do is they

339
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:59,189
should complement each other you don't

340
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:01,260
want them to be the exact same and again

341
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,000
I know another daunting task of taking

342
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,580
your resume and changing it over and

343
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,110
putting it on a LinkedIn profile but

344
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,170
you've got to think of your LinkedIn

345
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,660
profile as a fishing hook that's in the

346
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,430
water constantly fishing whether you're

347
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,640
sleeping whether your lunch wherever you

348
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,979
are

349
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,650
LinkedIn is out there fishing for that

350
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,870
next opportunity for you so your

351
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,689
headline should be an industry standard

352
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,220
job title and what by what I mean by

353
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,040
that is there are a lot of companies

354
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,940
that will have specific job titles that

355
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,790
are unique to the inside of that company

356
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:38,340
if I am searching on LinkedIn or a

357
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,890
security engineer or security analyst or

358
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,870
security architect if you don't fall

359
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,730
into that category you are using a job

360
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,830
title that's unique to your company it

361
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,920
is not going to help you be found on

362
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:52,980
LinkedIn so you need to go out to say

363
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,719
indeed you can do a search come up with

364
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,930
a job title that you can probably find

365
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,600
50 or more job titles or jobs of that

366
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,310
job title and put that in on your

367
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,720
LinkedIn profile as your job title that

368
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:08,280
will help a lot a tag line is something

369
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,030
that will catch a description or catchy

370
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,860
phrase that might help you stand out

371
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,660
from the masses so you could imagine as

372
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm telling you to put security engineer

373
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,370
or security analyst if you do that

374
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,740
there's going to be thousands of you of

375
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,360
us here in the Atlanta area so you might

376
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,860
come up with the catchy phrase or a

377
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,270
catchy description that says something

378
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,130
about you or your skills or the

379
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,050
opportunity you're looking for that

380
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,270
might make someone want to click on your

381
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,030
profile and come in and read a little

382
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,160
bit about you

383
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,199
your summary this is your elevator pitch

384
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,969
this is where you're going to get on

385
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,340
your soapbox and you are going to tell

386
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,930
me about you it is different

387
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,580
LinkedIn is different from a resume you

388
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,010
were going to talk about yourself in the

389
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,980
first first person you're gonna give me

390
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,780
a summary of your skills and experience

391
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,980
you might go so far as to tell me what

392
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,079
kind of opportunity you're you're

393
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,540
looking for if you're okay with your

394
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,160
firm knowing or if you're already out in

395
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,349
the job market you can certainly tell me

396
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,410
what kind of opportunity you think you

397
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,330
might be interested in you need to kind

398
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,920
of catch my attention and link some

399
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,630
accomplishments at the top and your

400
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,870
summary and you link those

401
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:17,480
accomplishments back down to your

402
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,460
experience you can consider this

403
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,760
building your brand you are branding

404
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:26,600
yourself as a strong engineer or pen

405
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:30,439
tester or analyst or security architect

406
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,300
this is building your brand so next I

407
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,610
put certifications and the reason why I

408
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,900
did this is if you did not know this you

409
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:41,390
can reorder your LinkedIn profile

410
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:44,569
certifications as it stands now come up

411
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,640
on the end of your profile and you're

412
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,050
hoping that someone is going to hang

413
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,520
around long enough on your profile or

414
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,290
stay interested long enough on your

415
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,870
profile that they're going to read all

416
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,209
the way to the bottom I like taking

417
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,820
certifications and moving it up under

418
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,740
summary and before experience because

419
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,140
this just really puts certifications

420
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,589
right in someone's face and they know a

421
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:09,170
little bit more about you right there

422
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:11,240
education again college university major

423
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,450
no dates you do not want to age date

424
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,980
yourself your experience just like your

425
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,720
resume except that you want to talk

426
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,310
about yourself in the first person I was

427
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,430
responsible for this I installed that I

428
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,899
use xx tool to scan just talk about

429
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,380
yourself and share that level of

430
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,660
experience with me skills and

431
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:33,710
endorsements the way that LinkedIn has

432
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:36,170
changed things you can have up to 50 but

433
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:40,220
on your page without me clicking into

434
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:43,190
more I can only see your top 3 you can

435
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,900
reorder and bring to the top your top 3

436
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,420
that I can see and then if I want to

437
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,770
click on it I can go into more but

438
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,660
please put your top

439
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,310
three skills on your skills and

440
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,220
endorsements endorsements don't mean

441
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:58,850
much but that's just the section that as

442
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:01,280
it's called on LinkedIn I do recommend

443
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,820
since you can have up to fifty skills

444
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,770
I do recommend trying to fill that up

445
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:09,200
skills is a section that is also a

446
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:13,040
keyword section and so if I want to

447
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,560
search for someone by just keywords this

448
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,290
is a great place to heavy load your

449
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,200
resume with various keywords that I'm

450
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,430
going to use to find you so I do

451
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,960
absolutely recommend that you fill that

452
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:29,870
up references

453
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,670
I recommend references two to three you

454
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,520
do not need more than two to three

455
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,530
references people are just not going to

456
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,260
invest that amount of time so don't

457
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,540
bother a bunch of people I also like

458
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:45,020
making sure that they are from a

459
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,520
previous manager or supervisor we all

460
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,440
know the people that would play golf

461
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,940
with or play tennis with or go out and

462
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,490
hang out with we know our friends are

463
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,130
going to give us good references and you

464
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,630
can easily read through that so if

465
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,160
you're going to take the time to put a

466
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,460
reference out there make sure it's a

467
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,530
previous manager or supervisor or

468
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,810
someone that you did a project with

469
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:07,610
someone that you may have done some

470
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,460
installations with or something that can

471
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:13,250
speak to how you are working with them

472
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:18,050
as a partner or a peer it's always very

473
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:20,360
important again content is king use

474
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:23,240
phrases and keywords that you want to be

475
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,490
found for a lot of times I won't

476
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,970
necessarily search by job title I will

477
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,350
search by keywords or phrases so keeping

478
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,090
that in mind you might want to build

479
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,070
your profile around those keywords and

480
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:37,879
phrases that you would like to be found

481
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,500
for always keep it just like your resume

482
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,270
if you're updating your resume try and

483
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,540
keep in mind keep your LinkedIn profile

484
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:46,220
updated again think about your profile

485
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,230
as a fishing hook in the water that is

486
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,040
always fishing for a new opportunity no

487
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,810
matter what you are doing so make sure

488
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,490
that you've filled it out and put a

489
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,260
little meat on the bone so to speak so

490
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:01,850
that people will know a little bit about

491
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,929
you word clouds if you're familiar with

492
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,299
the word cloud

493
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:07,010
I recommend running your resume and your

494
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:09,740
LinkedIn profile through a word cloud

495
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:12,650
and what a word cloud will do you know

496
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,090
anything about them is that the word in

497
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,429
the middle are the words in the middle

498
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,289
that show up the largest they're the

499
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:20,090
ones that you're using the most

500
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:22,370
throughout your resume or throughout

501
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,049
your LinkedIn profile they're the ones

502
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,600
that you're using to describe yourself

503
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:28,400
the most sometimes if you take a word

504
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,260
cloud and you visually look at it then

505
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,110
you'll see the words that you're using

506
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,940
over and over and over is that what you

507
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:38,360
want to be representing about yourself

508
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,100
is that representing correctly so you

509
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,219
know you might do that with your resume

510
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,260
I did it previously with just my summary

511
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,970
on my LinkedIn profile and then I did it

512
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,460
overall with my LinkedIn profile and

513
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,590
summary together they kind of presented

514
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,500
differently and separately so I had to

515
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:56,918
do some tweaking to make sure that it

516
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,850
came across the way that I wanted to

517
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:01,970
there's a link right there

518
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:03,918
ABC forward slash gains forward slash

519
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,710
words and there's an underscore in there

520
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:10,490
you can't see but word slash underscore

521
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:12,380
clouds it's free go in and generate a

522
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,090
couple word clouds and and play around

523
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:18,340
with it and see if you're if you're

524
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,340
presenting yourself as you like

525
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:24,060
so I know I went through that pretty

526
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,740
fast I didn't know I didn't know how it

527
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,110
would go so if there's any questions

528
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,620
maybe we could go over to slack this is

529
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:34,050
me my LinkedIn profile you can send me

530
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,120
an email you can that's my website you

531
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,100
can connect with me on LinkedIn I'm more

532
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,169
than happy to take a look at some

533
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,449
people's resumes since that's what I was

534
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:44,550
going to be doing today at besides if

535
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,140
anybody wants to email me or set up a

536
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:49,050
time we can talk I can look at some

537
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,880
resumes and make some recommendations I

538
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,070
can also do the same thing for LinkedIn

539
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,180
profiles if anybody wants to take time

540
00:21:53,070 --> 00:22:02,100
to do that he's Mike there's actually a

541
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:04,860
lot of questions for you in slack I have

542
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,449
a quick question before we let one of

543
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,929
our sponsors talk and a little met but

544
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:13,890
when I was doing recruiting at Purdue we

545
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:16,770
see one of the things I saw often from

546
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:20,010
you know going to various colleges is

547
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:22,500
people add their GPA on their resume

548
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,330
that's not something I ever did not

549
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,400
because I didn't have a good GPA I just

550
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:29,419
when I was writing my resume I never did

551
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,590
I didn't know how important that was

552
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:35,370
adding to a resume for somebody coming

553
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:37,080
out of college what do you think I mean

554
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,479
I think personally it says something

555
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,780
about you and your grades and your study

556
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,930
habits so I don't think it's a bad thing

557
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:47,280
I mean I've never had a manager say you

558
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,900
know good or bad about it but it

559
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,290
certainly it could say something about

560
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:55,230
you as a person and your abilities but I

561
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:56,970
don't know I don't I don't put a lot of

562
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:01,320
depth into it myself either I guess I

563
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:06,390
would say yeah and then let's say just

564
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:16,379
looking a few questions

565
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:19,860
any tips for getting past the 80s just

566
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:22,380
sometimes I see a lot of PDF resumes

567
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,360
that come over with a lot of formatting

568
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,260
that's fancy

569
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,060
certainly when you're going to an

570
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,580
interview and you take your resume with

571
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,409
you I do think that you need to take

572
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,750
your fancy formatted resume

573
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:36,120
with you but they recommend that you

574
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:39,750
have a text formatted resume that you

575
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:44,459
submit to the ATS is ATS is don't

576
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:46,290
generally like the pretty formatted with

577
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,120
the bars and sections and everything

578
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,830
they don't like them so you probably

579
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,209
ought to have a text version of your

580
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:54,899
resume that you're going to submit to

581
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:56,610
applicant tracking systems okay

582
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,110
and then another really key question

583
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,429
that I saw I have lots of personal

584
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,090
friends who have been out of the

585
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:04,260
workforce for an extended period of time

586
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:07,980
what what advice would you give somebody

587
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:11,940
like Bob I think more than anything

588
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,740
right now is so for some people what I

589
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:19,140
say is you know there's some people that

590
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:21,090
are pivoting say from a different type

591
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,370
of IT and they want to pivot over into

592
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:26,129
IT security and what I tell people is

593
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:28,260
you've got to use experience of where

594
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:31,710
you were to build a bridge to where you

595
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:33,330
want to go so if you can take that kind

596
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,780
of experience and obviously we're

597
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:38,310
talking about anything that you do

598
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,100
you've got to be able to talk to an

599
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:45,810
interview and and it can't be lying or

600
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:48,030
no but it'll build on experience that

601
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:50,460
you have on where you want to go and see

602
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:52,410
if you can help bridge that gap for

603
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,700
those people that and and right now

604
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,720
we're probably going to be facing that

605
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,600
people that have been out of the

606
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,180
workforce I think the only thing that we

607
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,100
can do is try and get out like we were

608
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,600
going to do it besides today and you've

609
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,490
got a network and you've got to get a

610
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,080
people's faces and you've got a network

611
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:09,120
or see if you can find some people that

612
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,570
will help Network on your behalf for you

613
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,600
and see if that will help you very cool

614
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,850
all right well if you can go into the

615
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,590
flood Channel and there's probably 10 or

616
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,719
15 questions they would love your

617
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:25,439
attention okay um and I'll let you just

618
