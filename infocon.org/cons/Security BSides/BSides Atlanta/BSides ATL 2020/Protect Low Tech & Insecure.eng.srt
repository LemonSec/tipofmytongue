thank you also for inviting me to talk

50
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:30,620
about low tech and insecure building

51
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,638
healthy boundaries and defeating

52
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,379
imposter syndrome hopefully this is not

53
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,569
a technical talk this is a talk about

54
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,819
being a human in tech that is something

55
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:44,388
I've had 20 plus years of experience

56
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:47,929
with and I want to set a couple of

57
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:49,099
expectations here whenever I've been

58
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,019
submitting this talk to besides

59
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:53,869
different V sides all over the country

60
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:55,669
for about a year now and I get two

61
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,099
pieces of feedback one piece of feedback

62
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:00,349
is this is natura talk it doesn't belong

63
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:02,659
at Abby sides and the other piece of

64
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:06,469
feedback I get is imposter syndrome

65
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:08,540
isn't a real thing so I want to address

66
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:12,950
those in case those are already in your

67
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,569
mind this is not an HR HR it's probably

68
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,879
a good thing I own my own company right

69
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:19,250
now because I don't think that HR would

70
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,739
really like what I'm about to say number

71
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,319
two impostor syndrome whether that is

72
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:26,690
real or not I am NOT going to wait for

73
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,418
the American Medical Association or for

74
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:33,500
the Mental Health God folks to declare

75
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:36,849
that an actual issue or label it a a

76
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,650
mental health issue people who are use

77
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,179
experiencing this anxiety feel like

78
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,919
impostor syndrome describes their

79
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,259
experience very well and I'm going to

80
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:47,780
not be dismissive of that experience for

81
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:51,048
them I do not have that experience I am

82
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,790
very fortunate in that regard so let me

83
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:55,489
tell you a little bit about why I feel

84
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,198
like I don't have that I am Curtis age

85
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:59,120
you can find me on LinkedIn you can find

86
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,060
me on Twitter I've worked at a lot of

87
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,090
big companies and in tech in Silicon

88
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,159
Valley mostly in IT and support

89
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:10,310
operations I ended up on a six-week

90
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:13,009
contract in 2013 at a little company

91
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,310
called fireEye that went from 300 people

92
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:18,349
when I started in April - almost 1,200

93
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,659
people including contractors by December

94
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:23,539
of that year so that was a wild ride I

95
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:25,880
ended up taking a role a long-term role

96
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:27,320
with them and four and a half years

97
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,810
later when I left it was like wow that

98
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,669
was amazing

99
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,500
I really loved the company but more than

100
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:35,630
that I really love this industry and

101
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,620
what information security and and

102
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,210
cybersecurity are trying to do from that

103
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,040
perspective it's easy to look at my

104
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,049
career and say I've been very successful

105
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,760
now there have been a lot of failures

106
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,740
that have gone into that success and

107
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,200
some of those for educational failures I

108
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,990
dropped out of Auburn before I could

109
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,909
fail out I started back to school at

110
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,000
Durham Tech shout out to our community

111
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:01,310
colleges and I did finally graduate with

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,229
a bachelor's degree in textile chemistry

113
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,210
of all things from and some states so

114
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:07,340
shout out to our public schools and then

115
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,289
I did a master's at an Ivy League

116
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,780
university which was essentially

117
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,580
fortunately for me out of pocket from

118
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,239
all of my Netflix stock when I went to

119
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,900
work there now I'm broke so but I tell

120
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,479
you these things to give you context of

121
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,760
my path into security and through

122
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:27,710
technology has a human being and as a

123
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,260
woman has been very diverse it's been

124
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,409
all over the place and I don't want

125
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,810
anyone to be discouraged if you have

126
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,460
career concerns I am always happy to

127
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,620
help or listen to you talk about those

128
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:44,450
things but let's get on talking about

129
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:47,090
being low tech and insecure boundaries

130
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,610
for me or what I feel like really

131
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,340
defined and helped me be successful or

132
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,190
more successful it has I've grown older

133
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:58,580
in technology and InfoSec we don't all

134
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,500
start out this amazing human being who's

135
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,039
full of confidence who knows what

136
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,770
they're doing

137
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,270
and and we look at other people and when

138
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,250
we see that and try to compare ourselves

139
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,010
to that that's really unfair comparison

140
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,139
we don't all start out with mentally

141
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,479
healthy families who are supportive of

142
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,880
our decisions we don't start in the

143
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,860
right body sometime there is a lot of

144
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,389
pieces that go into this that when

145
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,430
you're looking from the outside at

146
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:25,520
somebody you're not seeing their

147
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:28,150
evolution through through into their

148
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:34,940
success or into their person played so

149
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:37,370
part of it for me is just helping people

150
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,710
who either don't come from that healthy

151
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,599
background find that healthy level

152
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,669
playing field and also helping people

153
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:46,039
who do you

154
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,530
that hope the background understand you

155
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:52,820
bridge that gap how can you help it

156
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:56,059
folks who need when we're coaching on

157
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,540
the emotional or the human side I think

158
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,200
it's incredibly important has

159
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,460
technologists we want to solve

160
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,060
everything with a widget or an

161
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,710
application or a platform but the pieces

162
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,170
that we're securing the data that we

163
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:11,479
secure it's created by humans

164
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,870
it's acted on by humans it's stolen by

165
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:17,840
humans rate this is a human problem we

166
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,390
are we are in a technology field that

167
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,000
solves human problems and that's the

168
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:26,690
piece that I I feel like gets lost in

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,440
translation sometimes I love that I'm

170
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:32,420
seeing more and more b-sides and other

171
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,520
regional conferences focus more on the

172
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,460
given piece I think it's very important

173
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,520
I don't think you can be as successful

174
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:44,210
as you could be in technology if you

175
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,140
walk away from that human piece I'm

176
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,960
gonna start with some physical

177
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,810
boundaries the me to movement you hear

178
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,390
from a lot of folks I'm not sure what I

179
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:56,330
can and can't do I think coronavirus

180
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,919
right now coded 19 and the shelter in

181
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,890
place is going to change how we think

182
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,810
about our physical boundaries so this

183
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:07,400
slide may get updated in the next few

184
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:09,500
weeks and that how you impact other

185
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,099
people's space is very important when

186
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,810
you're very tall or very broad

187
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:18,080
physically big person who takes up a lot

188
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:20,270
of space you want to be a little bit

189
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,210
further back from people right when when

190
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,909
you close in on them we has humans we as

191
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,289
animals fundamentally find that to be a

192
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:32,600
very aggressive move and we're going to

193
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:35,840
move back in terms of touching it

194
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,840
becomes that's a very cultural piece

195
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,690
almost there's a lot of pieces around

196
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:45,170
where can I touch somebody how long a

197
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,730
very brief touches acceptable touching

198
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,890
on the arms is usually acceptable

199
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,600
historically shoulders have been

200
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:55,050
acceptable I think they're moving maybe

201
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,630
more more towards and maybe but

202
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,699
the front of anyone torso male or female

203
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,500
or unidentified that's just not

204
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,709
acceptable never you should never be

205
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,279
touching somebody's body torso breasts

206
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:11,339
chest upper thighs unless you know them

207
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,720
and have consent right when you're

208
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,000
taking pictures if you look at the

209
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,680
backside on the right there is a little

210
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,910
sliver of maybe if you're taking

211
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,430
pictures and you're sliding your arm

212
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,959
around somebody to gather people in for

213
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:26,040
a picture that's acceptable that's a

214
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:29,910
context specific incident right or it's

215
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,620
context specific moment but your hand

216
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,149
should stay up it should not slide down

217
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,130
to the hip it should definitely not

218
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:38,070
slide down to the rear these these are

219
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,610
very common-sense pieces most people

220
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,720
know this but not everyone does

221
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,820
especially if you come from a very

222
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,230
touchy-feely family and you're

223
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,560
surrounded by people who aren't as

224
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:52,500
comfortable being touched it's easy for

225
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,510
misinterpretation or discomfort to be

226
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,040
generated if you're much more physical

227
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,529
and I tend to be a very huggy physical

228
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,390
person and I've had to learn over the

229
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:02,070
years to kind of pull back make sure

230
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,300
when I go to see somebody I haven't seen

231
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,630
in a long time are you a hugger

232
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,000
or a handshake er asking is never a bad

233
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,189
idea people usually really appreciate it

234
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,649
especially when you're dealing with a

235
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:16,079
lot of introverts who aren't getting out

236
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,370
especially right now right who aren't

237
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,099
getting out and they're not seeing

238
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:23,640
people understanding physical boundaries

239
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:26,790
becomes very important and if you're not

240
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:31,050
sure it's totally fine to ask I don't

241
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:33,300
think anyone should ridicule you for

242
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,649
asking and if they do that's I want you

243
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,010
to remember that song them and not on

244
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,690
you

245
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:41,699
you were right to ask where those

246
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:44,339
boundaries are verbal boundaries words

247
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:46,800
can kill and I mean that both literally

248
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:49,980
we see a lot of cases where bullying has

249
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,729
led to a suicide families are pursuing

250
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,769
that prosecutors are pursuing that but

251
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,500
more importantly in a even more broad

252
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:59,820
context the words that you choose can

253
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,570
kill morale they can kill your

254
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,430
credibility the tone that you use and it

255
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,990
and this is a tough one because there

256
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,609
are people who have very flat effects

257
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,209
and very flat tones

258
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:15,930
you need to give you need to get people

259
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:17,630
room for cultural differences for single

260
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:21,120
you know English as a second language

261
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:23,279
it's important that we let people fill a

262
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,370
little and then offer to help them if

263
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,689
needed if you have a very flat

264
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,120
expectation and that's a part of who you

265
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:32,550
are and there's not a lot that you can

266
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,160
do about that it doesn't hurt to say I

267
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:37,620
know that this sounds very flat because

268
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,680
this is how I am let me give you a

269
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:45,870
little more context people are going to

270
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:49,589
be much more forgiving if you can try to

271
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,940
bridge that gap upfront right so I know

272
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:52,079
that we don't have a lot of time

273
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,970
together and they're probably going to

274
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,209
be some questions about this so I'm

275
00:11:53,970 --> 00:12:00,660
gonna hold questions off to the end if

276
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:02,880
you have in the workplace we get very

277
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,010
comfortable with each other we like to

278
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,439
talk smack we like to put each other

279
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,089
down sometimes and we can get some of us

280
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,500
can get very aggressive is with that if

281
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:11,579
we're very comfortable with it but you

282
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,589
have to be very aware of the people

283
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:16,800
around you and how they interpret that

284
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,449
give people an opt-out right if if

285
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,890
you're very casual and comfortable

286
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:22,500
talking about terrible things in the

287
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,660
office and somebody says hey guys could

288
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,940
you not ladies could you not could you

289
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,730
take us somewhere else be respectful and

290
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,390
thank them excuse yourselves to another

291
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,880
room and have that conversation

292
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:36,149
somewhere else we're in a profession

293
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:40,110
where there's a lot of pressure on us

294
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:42,990
and especially anyone who is involved in

295
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,699
defending human lives and one of those

296
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,410
outlets that we have is to express

297
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:48,899
things and very horrible and socially

298
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,480
unacceptable ways which can be very

299
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:55,399
funny but don't necessarily belong

300
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:58,680
somewhere where other people can hear it

301
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,360
be aware of your situation be aware of

302
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,699
your surroundings be aware of how you

303
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,260
look to other people you don't want to

304
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,810
kill your credibility because you're

305
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:11,130
trying to blow off some steam so I would

306
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:12,869
very much caution around there's a lot

307
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,079
that you can do around training for this

308
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:18,089
and there's also a lot that you can do

309
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:20,439
to step in if you feel like somebody is

310
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:23,170
being verbally aggressive and

311
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,690
and in a not good way it's okay to step

312
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:29,439
in absolutely or if they've said

313
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,730
something really truly horrible and I I

314
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,500
don't want to give you examples right

315
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,180
now because I've heard some really

316
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,280
terrible things but I'll give you an

317
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,920
example of how I respond to those things

318
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,750
and one of the responses I use is I want

319
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,160
you to hold that thought because I want

320
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,020
you to think about what you've said and

321
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,579
reflect on it later but I want you to

322
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,560
take this moment right now and say

323
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,190
anything else just say anything else

324
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,750
right and that kind of puts people an

325
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,690
alert that they have said something

326
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,970
egregiously wrong and gives them a

327
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,290
chance to self correct and that's worked

328
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,320
very well for me and in the

329
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:05,170
organizations I've worked in you may

330
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,810
need to sit down if you are a hiring

331
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,939
manager especially or or a leader in

332
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,739
your organization it does not hurt to

333
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,410
sit down and pattern at it and actually

334
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:17,230
write down an etiquette an etiquette

335
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,030
that you expect people to follow because

336
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,430
fundamentally we still have to work

337
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:23,410
together and we want to be respectful of

338
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:27,430
each other in the best way possible

339
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:29,290
right so if you have situations where

340
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,060
people have said something to you or

341
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,699
about you that you weren't sure how to

342
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,439
respond throw those in the in the slack

343
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,540
channel and we'll talk about those I

344
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,460
would love to get some examples and see

345
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,920
how people handle different things maybe

346
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:45,750
we can build a kind of a pool of

347
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,750
experience that people can share

348
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:52,540
emotional that is one of the biggest

349
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:54,580
gray areas because we as human beings

350
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,689
the first 20 years of our lives why are

351
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,520
us in very wildly different ways and our

352
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:04,480
emotional response may or may not be

353
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:06,520
appropriate to certain situations what I

354
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,770
really like people to remember is that

355
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,079
your your boundaries anything that makes

356
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,089
you uncomfortable has pushed on a

357
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,600
boundary and that boundary may be

358
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:17,670
perfectly reasonable or it may not your

359
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,020
boundaries are your own

360
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:22,120
other people don't have to understand

361
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,410
them or agree with them but hopefully

362
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,440
they do respect them if you are

363
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,750
terrified of dogs your friend bringing a

364
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,910
dog around is not going to make you not

365
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:34,279
terrify the dogs and it's it's a little

366
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:36,469
disrespectful of your phobia hey dogs

367
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,600
great I love dogs they're fantastic but

368
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,490
if you don't like dogs if you had a

369
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,410
traumatic experience with a dog and

370
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,810
you're half in your past my bringing a

371
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,730
dog around is not going to solve that

372
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,229
it's not going to defuse that it's going

373
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:54,290
to push that and it's gonna make you

374
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:56,209
upset be more aware if you can when

375
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,998
people say oh I have a phobia about that

376
00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:00,800
or no I'm really scared of that or

377
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:03,620
people just react very defensively to

378
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,809
something that's going on see if you can

379
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,149
break that down with them and if you can

380
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:10,850
understand what's going on maybe you can

381
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:13,670
work around it your boundaries are also

382
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:16,749
flexible you may be more forgiving of

383
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:20,689
being touched or being pushed verbally

384
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:23,470
by others in a given situation but not

385
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:25,129
by but not by a certain group right

386
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:28,009
that's up to you

387
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:31,879
that's up to you and you need to be very

388
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:32,689
clear on why you're more flexible with

389
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:35,689
some people than others

390
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:37,550
maybe you just trust some more but

391
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:39,399
mostly your boundaries whatever you

392
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,628
develop from an emotional standpoint

393
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,339
they should help you navigate the world

394
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:45,050
in the personal interactions that you

395
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:47,000
have with confidence if your boundaries

396
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,819
are too restrictive you're going to have

397
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,620
trouble with that and there's a given

398
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:53,089
take they're the it could be that you

399
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,370
just accept that as part of who you are

400
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:56,809
it could be that you find a therapist

401
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,449
who works with you through those those

402
00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:01,459
problems if you were madly in love with

403
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:04,010
someone and they have a dog and you're

404
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:06,648
you have a dog phobia you're gonna have

405
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,980
to figure out where that boundary is and

406
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:14,349
how you want to work around it and I I

407
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:18,280
don't I don't have any easy answers here

408
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:21,799
as I said a lot of us don't come from a

409
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:25,549
motion Elyse table supportive home and

410
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:27,589
so this piece becomes very critical and

411
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:29,270
learning how you're reacting to your

412
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,370
workplace and to the people you work

413
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:36,020
with and the trust and the relationships

414
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:37,850
that you build if you have and right now

415
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,270
especially with most of us working from

416
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:44,510
home this becomes very very stressed

417
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:47,720
because you are now even if you work

418
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,820
from home all the time now remain

419
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,860
or your spouse or your kids are home all

420
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,080
the time as well and that changes your

421
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,299
dynamic very much and that puts a lot of

422
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,158
pressure on your emotional boundaries so

423
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:00,470
I would really encourage you if you're

424
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:03,679
struggling right now don't beat yourself

425
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:07,840
up about it things are crazy right now

426
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,460
your life has been very much impacted by

427
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,980
something that you have a zero control

428
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,679
over and that's that's very stressful

429
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,549
whether or not you've been working from

430
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,900
home for years

431
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:23,120
so but if you have questions that you

432
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:27,020
think I can help you with take them to

433
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,399
the channel we'll go to them there now

434
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,379
I'm gonna get to the stuff that HR

435
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,320
really doesn't like to talk about and

436
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:36,700
that's sexuality sexuality in the

437
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:41,539
workplace in the industry at conferences

438
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:44,720
it happens we are fundamentally animals

439
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:46,250
we have attraction we have both

440
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,020
emotional attraction we have physical

441
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:54,409
attraction my biggest and simplest

442
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,210
advice is when it comes to sexuality in

443
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:59,600
the workplace and relationships in the

444
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:03,799
workplace taking them beyond co-worker

445
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:08,059
environment don't do it just do it it's

446
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:10,220
just a bad idea and I have seen it work

447
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:12,710
out very well for people I have seen it

448
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,840
go very badly as well

449
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,990
I have seen people quit jobs and leave

450
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:24,320
industries over it it is it is a tough

451
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:26,929
line to walk if you are spending a lot

452
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,149
of time with someone though you do you

453
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:30,799
you're spending eight hours 10 hours a

454
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:34,159
day sometimes working with that person

455
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,980
and you're creating those bonds maybe

456
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,880
you're responding to that you also have

457
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:41,330
to remember that maybe they're not

458
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,010
responding to it the best thing that you

459
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,620
can do is be extremely clear in your

460
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:48,110
communication if you think there is no

461
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:51,649
hope that this personality has a

462
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,399
committed relationship don't just don't

463
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,700
even go there

464
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,010
just drop it it hurts it sucks to work

465
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,570
around but you do you get over it

466
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,580
eventually I promise I promise

467
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:06,299
I've been in this situation I've been

468
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:09,928
the target of this situation it is it's

469
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:12,779
tough I I won't lie it will stretch your

470
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:16,980
new boundaries you'll learn you'll learn

471
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:20,480
to grow the other piece of this though

472
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:24,000
is even if you do start a relationship

473
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,340
it can get very dicey because if people

474
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,990
don't know that you're in a relationship

475
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,928
and they see you getting a little bit

476
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:33,600
more cozy that can raise questions of

477
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:37,590
your credibility and and that becomes a

478
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,209
risk for you and for your career if that

479
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,709
person is already in a relationship even

480
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,480
if that relationship is an open

481
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,200
relationship and your relationship is

482
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,600
consensual

483
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,269
not everyone office may know that right

484
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,799
if if you are going to do an office

485
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:55,139
romance take it out of the office and be

486
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,019
very clear upfront if this seems to be

487
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:59,610
working out you know does one of us need

488
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:02,820
to leave the company does one of us need

489
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:04,649
to leave the organization I have seen it

490
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:08,309
where and of course some of the really

491
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:10,559
large companies I believe in Silicon

492
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:12,658
Valley have dating services so they can

493
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,389
match their own employees up if you're

494
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:16,529
working in totally different places that

495
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:18,418
is not a problem

496
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:20,639
but if you're in a smaller organization

497
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,799
that it becomes a huge problem and you

498
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:26,309
need to be very aware of that before you

499
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:31,049
make any move on anyone but for the most

500
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:33,570
part just don't that's my best advice I

501
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:35,340
have had workplace relationships there

502
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,080
are people that I would would work with

503
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,820
again in a heartbeat with the

504
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,168
understanding that that was the past and

505
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,820
won't ever happen again and I know that

506
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:43,409
they know that and I know that and we

507
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,500
can work together fine I've had

508
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:49,529
workplace relationship where where

509
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,139
that's not a case so it can be very

510
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:53,279
dicey if you are in this situation and

511
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:57,120
you're looking for some guidance I'm

512
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:59,639
happy to talk to you about that but more

513
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:07,370
importantly there there are other pieces

514
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:08,479
here that I'm just going to jump to a

515
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,280
should

516
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,990
send this person a dick pic like if

517
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,270
you're on that point I'm really into

518
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:18,200
this person yeah male or female whoever

519
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:20,510
you're your target is really did they

520
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,490
specifically ask for that because if

521
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:25,669
they didn't don't do it just understand

522
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,410
just don't do it it's a bad idea if they

523
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:29,750
specifically ask for it that's a

524
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:32,450
different thing and what I don't go into

525
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,770
here is also there there's so many

526
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,020
topics that we can talk about here

527
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,490
revenge porn if you are surfing than

528
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,490
that and you come across porn of a

529
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:42,950
co-worker that puts you in a very

530
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,570
interesting place because if you tell

531
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,790
that person that you have found porn of

532
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,100
them did they already know is this going

533
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,990
to be crushing or they are you putting

534
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,469
them in a very emotionally vulnerable

535
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:57,230
place for the most part I would try to

536
00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:00,140
be very circumspect about that

537
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,419
it's unfortunate unfortunate truth in

538
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:05,210
our industry we're very familiar there

539
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:07,429
are a lot of women in our industry or in

540
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:11,210
tech in general in the world in general

541
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:13,820
who've been victims of revenge porn and

542
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,410
it's a very sensitive subject how you

543
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,470
would approach somebody about that I

544
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:20,809
would be very careful I would not I

545
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,580
would certainly not send that link

546
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:24,799
around and say hey is this so-and-so

547
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,740
that is not okay if you think it's so

548
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,940
and so make the assumption that it is

549
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:32,419
delete it from your hard drive never

550
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,919
look at it again and make if you think

551
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:35,720
they don't know it's out there and and

552
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,890
you think they trust you enough and

553
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,820
you're willing to help them in whatever

554
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:43,549
way you can maybe approach it but if

555
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,470
it's not someone that you know well you

556
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:47,620
may do more damage than good and that's

557
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,450
something that you'll want to consider

558
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,790
and in terms of sending images of

559
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,340
yourself whether you're male or female

560
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:58,010
if they have not been requested don't do

561
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,860
it because it's it's a very dicey thing

562
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,179
that you that you're really you're

563
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,879
really putting your credibility out

564
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:09,780
there and some potentially very negative

565
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,490
ways right so I know if

566
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,889
kind of step through very quickly a lot

567
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,110
of things about pushing boundaries and

568
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:18,090
but I want I want to get spend a little

569
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:21,479
more time around the concept of

570
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,830
boundaries and abuse pushing boundaries

571
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,940
can be a good thing they take you out of

572
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,730
your comfort zone and they give you a

573
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,140
chance to grow but if somebody's pushing

574
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,270
your boundaries repeatedly to the point

575
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:33,330
where you ask them to stop with that's a

576
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:37,770
problem and you see that a lot with more

577
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:39,780
control of use of a more less so in the

578
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:43,550
workplace with physical abuse although I

579
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:46,350
have I have seen witnessed that as well

580
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:48,120
but if if you are to the point where

581
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:51,570
you've asked somebody to stop that's

582
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:54,989
that you're getting some some great very

583
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:57,090
yellow orange areas and if they continue

584
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,560
doing it after you've stopped ask them

585
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,199
to stop especially if you ask them

586
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,990
repeatedly to stop now now we're getting

587
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,180
to abuse territory obviously anything

588
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:08,490
that is illegal a sexual or physical

589
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,480
assault that's obviously an abuse you

590
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,060
know call the police

591
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,950
but in the workplace that can be harder

592
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,320
you know it's a lot harder to recognize

593
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,210
abuse especially if you either came from

594
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,399
an abusive family so this looks like

595
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,980
normal kind of behavior to you and it's

596
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,690
really not acceptable or you come from a

597
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,580
normal family and you've never

598
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:32,120
encountered this before sometimes it can

599
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:35,389
be very very subtle excessive negativity

600
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,300
belittling nothing you do is good enough

601
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:40,490
the obvious ones of course yelling

602
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,980
name-calling that kind of thing but

603
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:46,650
those are very obvious it can be very

604
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,540
subtle gaslighting is a term that we use

605
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:50,940
a lot in relationships it comes from an

606
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:54,780
old movie I think in the 1940s or 50s

607
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,580
where basically they're turning lights

608
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:59,280
and on and off and telling this woman

609
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:02,730
she's crazy when in reality they're

610
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:05,580
trying to drive her crazy it can be that

611
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:09,780
malicious a lot of that is about control

612
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,909
and the desire for control if you are if

613
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,110
you're questioning whether or not your

614
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:18,270
box is abusive

615
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:21,959
I would definitely seek a third party to

616
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,960
bounce some ideas off of because it can

617
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,909
be

618
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,490
it can be tough to see it it can be very

619
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:30,159
tough to see it making you feel like

620
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:34,390
nothing you ever do at work is is good

621
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:36,760
enough is a big red flag to me at moving

622
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:40,179
goals like oh if you do this project

623
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,500
then I'll give you this title oh well

624
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:42,850
you didn't do that project as well as I

625
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,230
thought you would but they don't have

626
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:48,029
any constructive feedback but the goal

627
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:54,270
was moved that's that's pretty shady

628
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:56,470
being in a work environment can be very

629
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:59,080
emotionally devastating with the wrong

630
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:01,659
box and if you're a new if you're new to

631
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:04,330
the work field you don't necessarily

632
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:08,080
know what a good boss versus a bad boss

633
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:10,149
it looks like if you're not sure go and

634
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,039
ask someone come you know hit me in

635
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:15,370
Twitter I'll give you my phone number

636
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:19,000
we'll talk about it there there are

637
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:20,949
times when it really is clear that that

638
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,470
your boss is just emotionally not

639
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,390
healthy and they're creating a very

640
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,700
toxic environment for you over then and

641
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,980
work in and there's only so many things

642
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,830
that you can do there

643
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:35,590
HR usually is invested and not rocking

644
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:37,779
the boat they don't want your complaints

645
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,330
because now they have to do something

646
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:42,399
about them and because you're the low

647
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,500
person on the totem pole or you're not

648
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:47,408
the director or whatever you know they

649
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,299
have invested in sometimes that solution

650
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:52,240
is to make you go away

651
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:54,700
and that's not pretty but that is a

652
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,240
reality of corporate America that I want

653
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:01,330
you to be aware of HR is not your friend

654
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,789
HR is there to cover the company as long

655
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:05,980
as keeping you happy does serve the

656
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:10,620
company they're going to keep you happy

657
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:13,210
but when your situation becomes a risk

658
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,010
you were just as likely to be the person

659
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,419
to go or more likely to be the person to

660
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,610
go especially if there's a power

661
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:21,580
imbalance if it's a director or a

662
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:23,049
manager it's a problem right and and

663
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,059
you're the easier problem to solve

664
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:29,470
sweeping the problem under the rug is

665
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:32,100
usually easier to solve so be very

666
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:34,460
careful when you're when you're

667
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,649
traversing this route

668
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:39,830
how you handle those discussions with HR

669
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:42,950
if it's anything that can be absolutely

670
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:45,260
recorded and is knew and acted on

671
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:47,600
legally then you need to record it act

672
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,490
on legally not through your HR

673
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,240
department you need to engage outside

674
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:54,980
counsel or go ahead and call the police

675
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,180
and do it that way because a lot of

676
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:02,030
times I knew a woman who came from a

677
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,250
large corporation that had essentially a

678
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:07,250
whisper network where one director in

679
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:09,860
particular would hit his co-workers or

680
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:12,200
his his peers and other groups at

681
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:15,860
conferences with a day drug rape drug

682
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:18,260
and that company had probably 10 or 12

683
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,179
complaints about that person and he was

684
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,160
no it was always easier to sweep it

685
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,260
under the rug for them so once you'd be

686
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,680
very aware if you're at an industry

687
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:30,560
conference even with your own team keep

688
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:34,070
an eye out for each other it's super

689
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:36,020
important that we be as ethical as

690
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:39,320
possible in our industry and there were

691
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:41,120
people who abused that and I can't I

692
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,580
can't underscore the seriousness of that

693
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,010
enough so I know that we don't have a

694
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,510
lot of time together and and this is a I

695
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,180
got into some pretty heavy stuff pretty

696
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:52,790
quick and we're coming up on two minutes

697
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:55,550
before I need to hand this over so I

698
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:57,680
want to give you some resources if you

699
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:59,510
feel like you have grown up in an

700
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,690
abusive or traumatic environment if you

701
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:04,550
have been incredibly depressed and are

702
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,440
feeling suicidal if you have been

703
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:10,639
sexually assaulted there are a lot of

704
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:13,280
resources out there please never be

705
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,550
afraid to ask for help whether it's a

706
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,680
small thing and saying to a co-worker

707
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:20,149
I'm really drowning right now can you

708
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,670

off of me and being willing to step and

710
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:26,990
step up and do the same when they're

711
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:29,780

can't I cannot express that enough for

714
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:39,260
me learning to ask for help was the

715
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:42,140
biggest piece of making this all all

716
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,730
possible so with that I know we're

717
