1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,490
so hey everyone I'm Nico I'm gonna be

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,040
doing the talk from zero to red team

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,560
we're gonna be talking about what a red

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,879
team is and when we need one and when I

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,530
should put my computer in do you know

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:21,710
sister so the first thing we'll talk

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:38,839
about Oh hold on and let me share my

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:49,219
screen that's about me all right can you

9
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:53,179
guys see the presentation yes yep okay

10
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:55,609
great all right so a little about me

11
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:58,309
before we get started

12
00:00:55,609 --> 00:01:01,190
Nico my name is Nico I'm on the red team

13
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:02,019
at Deloitte I'm based in San Diego

14
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,489
California

15
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:07,310
before coming to Deloitte I worked at

16
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,830
several companies Accenture PwC ResMed

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:13,310
an active network I'm also an adjunct

18
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:15,800
professor specializing in ethical

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:19,660
hacking and information assurance at

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,160
several universities here in San Diego I

21
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:25,460
got my undergraduate degree in political

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,470
science from UC San Diego and my grad

23
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,809
degree in information security from the

24
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,610
University of London is anybody who

25
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,310
knows me will tell you I hate coffee and

26
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:37,910
I much prefer Red Bull you can follow me

27
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,710
on twitter at eco Behar then my LinkedIn

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:46,130
address is at the bottom of the slide

29
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:48,169
here so first thing we need to do is we

30
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,759
need to map the attack surface and so in

31
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,890
order to do that we need to understand

32
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,510
what our assets are so in today's day

33
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,760
and age assets can come in a lot of

34
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,740
different shapes and sizes so I was

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:02,120
shown in the beautiful stock photograph

36
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:05,300
here we have phones laptops mice we can

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,729
have IOT devices we can have operational

38
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,758
technology devices medical devices we

39
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:12,650
can have ICS devices anything really

40
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:15,549
with an operating system or a network

41
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,830
connection can be considered an asset

42
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,440
and we first thing we have to do before

43
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:23,910
we actually go and form a red team or

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:29,170
Commissioner red team is we have to

45
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:30,670
determine our assets so first type of

46
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,579
asset we're going to look at our

47
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,519
hardware assets so there's a few

48
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,370
different types we have endpoints and in

49
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,970
that category we have laptops desktops

50
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:45,550
and terminals then we also have servers

51
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:48,450
in that category we have file servers

52
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,710
databases and hypervisors among others

53
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,260
then we have Network Devices which

54
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:57,490
include routers switches access points

55
00:02:53,260 --> 00:03:00,040
firewalls and hubs we also have mobile

56
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:03,340
assets so smart phones tablets and

57
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,190
points of sale and then operational

58
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,760
technology or high-end IOT so any

59
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:13,510
network enabled devices any ICS devices

60
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,609
any sensors any medical devices and we

61
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,190
want to collect certain data points from

62
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,440
our Hardware assets so we'll want to

63
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,930
collect the serial number we'll want to

64
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,870
collect the model number we'll want to

65
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,900
look at the manufacturer we'll want to

66
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,360
look at the warranty and the hardware

67
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,900
specifications this is important because

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,280
different Hardware types can have unique

69
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,690
vulnerabilities like firmware

70
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,550
vulnerabilities architecture

71
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:45,310
vulnerabilities and hardware

72
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:47,860
vulnerabilities next we want to look at

73
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,540
software assets so there's several

74
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,060
different types of software that we want

75
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,010
to look at first we'll want to look at

76
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:59,020
operating systems so for example Unix

77
00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:02,530
Linux Microsoft Mac Android iOS among

78
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:04,600
others then we have productivity

79
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,920
software so we're talking about word

80
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,350
processors spreadsheet software slide

81
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,619
deck software any email clients any

82
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,719
calendar software another type of

83
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,519
software is a driver and that's a piece

84
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,370
of software that allows the operating

85
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,400
system to interact with the hardware own

86
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:28,030
host then we have other third-party

87
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,289
software so video editing software CAD

88
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,628
software

89
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:36,909
visual design software any data

90
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:38,770
visualization software any IDE etc so

91
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:41,379
what kind of data do we want to collect

92
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:45,248
about these assets while we want to

93
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:48,069
collect first application name then the

94
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:52,389
version number who's the vendor of the

95
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:54,610
application is the application supported

96
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,619
right so a little side story here I was

97
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:01,089
recently at a client and they were

98
00:04:56,619 --> 00:05:03,789
running a patching system that was not

99
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:06,789
supported for the past three years and

100
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:09,909
could not patch Windows 10 so it's very

101
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:11,680
important to find out if the software

102
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,509
that you're running is supported and

103
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,999
updates are still provided for it

104
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:18,819
we also want to look at any dependencies

105
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:20,229
so maybe it has some library the

106
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,479
software will have some libraries that

107
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:24,188
it runs on or some codecs that need to

108
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,498
be installed so we want to make sure

109
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:28,629
we're looking at those as well and the

110
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:30,669
reason that this matters is because

111
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,499
different applications can introduce

112
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:34,808
various vulnerabilities in different

113
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:37,209
parts of the application or the

114
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:42,249
underlying libraries runtimes or

115
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:43,990
dependencies and those are all that are

116
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,889
just the two different types and now

117
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,159
let's put it together

118
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:50,349
so now we can see which vulnerabilities

119
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:52,808
are in the environment so the hardware

120
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:55,089
asset information will help monitor for

121
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:57,699
vulnerabilities that affect the hardware

122
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:59,800
and equipment in the environment the

123
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,839
software asset information is going to

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,939
help monitor for vulnerabilities that

125
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,789
affect applications running in the

126
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:08,409
environment so now we can look at vendor

127
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:11,050
advisories to see if there's any

128
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:14,050
vulnerabilities that have been disclosed

129
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,550
we can do the same with mailing lists we

130
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,499
can look at community forums and

131
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,469
discussion boards and we can look at any

132
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:24,219
update feeds for many of our security

133
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:26,740
products that we have so this matters

134
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:28,509
because monitoring the environment and

135
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,449
the appropriate information sources

136
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:34,119
allows for identification and analysis

137
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:36,490
of new vulnerabilities that are present

138
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:40,689
in the environment and in step zero on

139
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:43,629
our journey to a red team all right

140
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:47,409
so now we'll look at the next step which

141
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:51,729
is vulnerability management so some

142
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:54,369
objectives and activities we're going to

143
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:55,508
scan assets for vulnerabilities and

144
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:58,299
misconfigurations

145
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:01,239
so we can do this with a commercial

146
00:06:58,299 --> 00:07:03,429
solution like necess or we can use an

147
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:06,818
open source solution like open bass or

148
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:08,349
we can build our own solution we want to

149
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:09,809
make sure that we're monitoring and

150
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:13,419
analyzing threats and vulnerabilities

151
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:15,969
reported in real time to respond to

152
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:18,429
security incidents right so we want to

153
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:20,769
look at any threats new threats and new

154
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:23,979
vulnerabilities that are being released

155
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:26,589
through whatever mechanisms were using

156
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:29,769
to get those whether that be a threat

157
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:32,379
intelligence feed or through community

158
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:33,639
intelligent sharing network we want to

159
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:36,849
make sure that we're using that

160
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,739
information to respond to security

161
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:41,589
incidents that may present themselves in

162
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:44,018
our environment we want to make sure

163
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:46,769
that we're maintaining our scanning

164
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:50,469
tools and we're reviewing the latest

165
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:52,539
rules and configurations that are to be

166
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:55,089
used we want to make sure that they line

167
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:57,729
up with our environment and that they're

168
00:07:55,089 --> 00:08:00,819
not going to take anything down we also

169
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:04,149
want to use the software asset

170
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:06,339
information to help monitor for

171
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:10,059
vulnerabilities that affect applications

172
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:11,649
that are running in our environment so

173
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:15,009
we're doing this but how do we actually

174
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:17,919
determine if we're performing as we

175
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:19,659
should be well first thing we want to do

176
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,029
is we want to consider the risk and

177
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:24,009
prioritize the activity so this is very

178
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:26,079
important because every organization is

179
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:28,029
different and so every organization's

180
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,279
risk is going to be different so they're

181
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:31,569
going to be measuring and differently

182
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,370
and they're going to be looking at

183
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:35,680
different vulnerabilities because every

184
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,769
organization has different unique risks

185
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:42,188
that are posed to them and so they

186
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:43,899
should approach that appropriately after

187
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:46,870
we've considered the risk and prioritize

188
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:48,850
the activity we can also look at the

189
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,579
percentage of organizationally deemed

190
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,209
critical systems scan per quarter so of

191
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:56,300
the systems that are the most

192
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:58,429
to us so for example let's say we have a

193
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,779
bottling company somebody that bottle

194
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:02,720
soda right one of their most critical

195
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:05,749
systems would be the system that runs

196
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,259
the the bottling machine the one that

197
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:11,600
actually files the bottles through the

198
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:13,040
factory and they get filled with this

199
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,839
soda right so that's gonna be a very

200
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,059
that's going to be a critical system so

201
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,329
how many of the systems with that

202
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:22,040
criticality that are very very important

203
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:25,309
throughout the organization have been

204
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,839
examined this quarter another metric we

205
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:27,920
can look at to see how we're doing is we

206
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,259
can look at the number of

207
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,800
vulnerabilities that have been

208
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:36,459
enumerated we can also look at the

209
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,069
percentage of systems with no known

210
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:41,959
severe vulnerabilities we can look at

211
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:44,420
the percentage of detected

212
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:48,229
vulnerabilities associated with accepted

213
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:52,128
risks or non-technical controls so what

214
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,740
we mean by accepted risks is that

215
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:57,050
sometimes we can get a if we're not able

216
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,660
to patch a vulnerability we can get a

217
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,910
risk exception and then they'll and the

218
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,089
risk is then accepted and they will

219
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:07,249
allow us to forego applying or that

220
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:10,119
update or remediating that vulnerability

221
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:12,949
because somebody has accepted the risk

222
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:13,990
now we can also another metric we can

223
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:16,670
look at the percentage of

224
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:20,299
vulnerabilities associated with known

225
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,769
patches or fixes and how many how many

226
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:23,839
of those vulnerabilities have been

227
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:25,999
actually remediated and how many are

228
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,999
still in the environment waiting to be

229
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:30,980
remediated with the patch available so

230
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:33,589
the reason that a vulnerability

231
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,629
management matters is because monitoring

232
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:37,309
our environment and the appropriate

233
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:39,980
information sources will allow us to

234
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:41,749
efficiently identify and address new

235
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,790
vulnerabilities that are present in our

236
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:47,329
environment and this is going to be

237
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:49,809
considered step one on our journey to a

238
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:49,809
red team

239
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:57,120
all right so next we have penetration

240
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,920
testing and this is where we're actually

241
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:05,130
going to exploit the vulnerabilities so

242
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,500
oftentimes it can start out with a set

243
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,930
of formal documents right and so for

244
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,090
example it could have a statement of

245
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,680
work and a rules of engagement and the

246
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,440
rules of engagement is going to say what

247
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,489
we can and cannot do so we'll oftentimes

248
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,410
refer to the rules of engagement

249
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,450
document to see if something's in scope

250
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,640
so before we start a penetration test

251
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,290
we're gonna look at all the systems for

252
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,819
going to sit down with the client and

253
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,959
we're going to determine the scope and

254
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,390
we're gonna determine their pools of

255
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,510
engagement so they can say okay you can

256
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,520
only test between one time I had it

257
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,700
where it was you can only test between

258
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,650
4:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. so you have to

259
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,660
be on-site only between 4:00 p.m. and

260
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,880
2:00 a.m. right and so if that's what

261
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,240
the rules of engagement say then that's

262
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,250
the time that you're going to be testing

263
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,080
penetration tests also allow an

264
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,730
organization to discover potential

265
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,350
weaknesses in their environment because

266
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,510
the key difference here between the

267
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,550
penetration tests and the vulnerability

268
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,140
assessment is that in a penetration test

269
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,880
are actually exploiting the

270
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,800
vulnerability whereas in the

271
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,900
vulnerability assessment we're just

272
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,000
checking to see if the vulnerability is

273
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,890
present now that's not to say that we

274
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,240
could potentially exploit it there but

275
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,949
the key difference between the

276
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,200
penetration test and the vulnerability

277
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,870
assessment it's the active exploitation

278
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,850
of vulnerabilities and so this gives us

279
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,250
an opportunity to test our security

280
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,830
controls are the controls that are

281
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,320
looking for exploitation going to detect

282
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,510
that exploitation or are they going to

283
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,090
fail and not be able to detect that

284
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:37,020
exploitation the penetration test is

285
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:38,700
ideally going to be a blackbox test that

286
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,770
ideally would be performed by a third

287
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,250
party in order to get an independent

288
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:47,130
perspective and it can oftentimes be

289
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:51,090
compliance driven as we know a lot of

290
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:54,600
regulations like HIPAA Sox among others

291
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:58,710
they require penetration tests to be

292
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,510
carried out I think every year or

293
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:02,880
multiple times per year depending on the

294
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:06,660
regulation

295
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,210
and the security team so oftentimes

296
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:12,510
gonna know that the penetration test is

297
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:14,880
going on so how do we measure our

298
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,170
performance in one or conducting

299
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,910
penetration tests how do we know that

300
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,479
they're helping our organization become

301
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:24,180
more secure well how many

302
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,370
vulnerabilities have we picked up right

303
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,160
did we pick up all the vulnerabilities

304
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:32,490
that were picked up in the vulnerability

305
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,969
assessment base are we able to identify

306
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,950
the main root cause that can address a

307
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,900
lot of the findings that the penetration

308
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:44,370
test has brought to light so if we have

309
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:46,170
a lot of MIS configuration do we know

310
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:50,280
why everything is misconfigured are we

311
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,020
able to address that so we can fix it if

312
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,520
we have something that's not updated do

313
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,220
we know why it's not updated are we

314
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,880
going to be able to identify the root

315
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,800
cause and then go and fix it and so the

316
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:06,660
reason that penetration testing matters

317
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:09,599
is because monitoring it and testing it

318
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:12,480
is actually going to allow us to see if

319
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,220
we can test our controls and see if we

320
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,610
can actually exploit the vulnerabilities

321
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:21,710
and it's step two on our journey to the

322
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:24,180
red tape so now let's get to Red Team

323
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,790
operations and one of the main goals of

324
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,839
teams operations is to look at the

325
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:32,670
organizational blind box so we're going

326
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,770
to assess the effectiveness of the

327
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,319
organization's cybersecurity program

328
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,199
from a holistic standpoint to include

329
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,850
the monitoring and response capabilities

330
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,740
so the testing is performed and via

331
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,440
tailored scenarios looking at an

332
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,720
organization as a sum of its parts so

333
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,480
we're taking into account physical human

334
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,120
and cyber as well as from the point of

335
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,460
view of a determined attacker so these

336
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,840
are oftentimes the different aspects

337
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,970
that we're going to look at when we're

338
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,600
doing a Red Team engagement right so we

339
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:06,300
can look at physical entry we can look

340
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,730
at physical access mechanisms access

341
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,130
control mechanisms or also definitely

342
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,740
going to look at the human element right

343
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:16,200
and a lot of the times we're going to

344
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,820
engage in phishing

345
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,760
all right so I promise pretty pictures

346
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,220
so here come to pick pretty pictures all

347
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,370
right so the bottom line with red

348
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,690
teaming right so real quick some points

349
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,210
of reference based on our client

350
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:34,530
experience so six days is the average

351
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:38,280
time to achieve a set objective after

352
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:40,430
the reconnaissance phase 94% of our

353
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:44,790
clients we're successfully compromised

354
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:46,439
during the red teaming engagement 70% of

355
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,530
our clients had very limited

356
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,780
capabilities in detecting or responding

357
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:56,730
to the breach of their system and their

358
00:15:51,780 --> 00:16:00,089
crown jewels and one day is on average

359
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:02,790
the time to compromise the first device

360
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:06,300
and gain initial access to the clients

361
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:08,160
network after the reconnaissance face so

362
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,859
when we talk about adversarial

363
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,660
simulation or red teaming we're talking

364
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,030
about a realistic approach to security

365
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,209
testing right because we're emulating

366
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:21,060
our adversaries so it's going to enable

367
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:24,030
an organization to assess their overall

368
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,310
readiness resiliency and awareness using

369
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:29,910
a realistic scenario based controlled

370
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:31,770
events adversarial simulations offerings

371
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,630
go above and beyond for 'nor ability

372
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:36,720
assessments and penetration testing as

373
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:39,900
it incorporates all components within

374
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,260
the organization in scope and has a

375
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,449
realistic scenario based approach but

376
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,370
ultimately red team operations allow

377
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,680
organizations to mature their cyber

378
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:52,350
capabilities and kickstart

379
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,030
transformation programs so as we talked

380
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,270
about on the last slide there's three

381
00:16:54,030 --> 00:17:00,060
core elements that we consider when

382
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,439
we're doing red teaming so the first

383
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,390
thing we're gonna look at is we're gonna

384
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,130
look at physical so we're gonna look at

385
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:07,560
your buildings we're gonna look at your

386
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,120
desks we're gonna look at the safes

387
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,000
right and we're gonna look at any

388
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,520
physical IT infrastructure the amount of

389
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,569
passwords that I have found on people's

390
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,699
desks I've lost track people leaving

391
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:23,040
their drawers on lock right a whole

392
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:26,520
bunch of stuff going on in the physical

393
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,680
element then we have human helmet right

394
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,340
so that represents the employees or

395
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,780
customers the

396
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,070
clients or third parties that bind the

397
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,370
cyber in the physical world together

398
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:41,040
right so people will oftentimes hold the

399
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,780
door open for you or if you ask them

400
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,970
questions they will give you the answer

401
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:49,670
even if they're not supposed to right

402
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:52,910
then we have cyber that represents the

403
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:58,130
online world the Internet as well as

404
00:17:52,910 --> 00:18:01,170
corporate internets right any cloud

405
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:05,790
services right and all other computer

406
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:09,600
networks and devices so some use cases

407
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:12,060
for adversary simulation right so the

408
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,399
first example we can look at is source

409
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,169
code exfiltration so somebody might

410
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,660
bring in a red team to do source code

411
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:21,960
exfiltration so they can test from both

412
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,720
a trusted insider and an external threat

413
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,300
agent perspective right so we're going

414
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,360
to do so for example we could do

415
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:33,600
reconnaissance and find the exposed

416
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,800
repository or we could find it on the

417
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,610
Internet

418
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,590
then after that we could exfiltrate the

419
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,139
code we could also test developer

420
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:46,350
workstations and develop and deployment

421
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,570
workflows like Jenkins to create target

422
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:52,500
packages for spearfishing developers

423
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:56,330
right we could X well we could export

424
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,890
rate through physical means such as USB

425
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:02,610
another use case would be customer data

426
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:05,820
exfiltration we could identify where the

427
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:08,310
technology stores customer data where

428
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,899
the website and CRM the databases the

429
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:14,340
workstations the software as service

430
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,440
applications and the client services

431
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,530
data is stored then we can test

432
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:23,040
different exfiltration vectors both

433
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,570
overt and covert and depending on what

434
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,800
we find during the reconnaissance phase

435
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:33,120
and we can also leverage targeting data

436
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:36,149
supplied by our reconnaissance phase to

437
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,989
attack eternally facing weaknesses and

438
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:42,750
misconfigurations we could also

439
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:46,980
go after a manufacturing and logistics

440
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:50,010
system first we would identify critical

441
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,770
manufacturing and logistic systems then

442
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:55,760
we would conduct physical and wireless

443
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:58,620
security testing at manufacturing plants

444
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,780
then we would test system segmentation

445
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:05,459
move laterally throughout the network

446
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:08,010
and then we would test any hardware and

447
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:14,160
firmware and maybe do some source code

448
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:16,590
review we can also look at remote update

449
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,600
mechanisms for customer systems right so

450
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,570
we've done a few of those we can test

451
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,330
the authentication mechanisms and we can

452
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:27,360
see if we can bypass them we can test

453
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:30,270
the impact of an insider threat to

454
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,310
clients so this is one that I was lucky

455
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:35,129
enough to have just done unfortunately

456
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:37,950
it was cancelled but we were doing an

457
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,900
insider threat emulation at a point

458
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:43,110
where we had to break out of a Citrix

459
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:46,710
environment we were successful until the

460
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:49,679
corona virus came along also code

461
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:51,240
signing services another example so the

462
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,420
first thing we would try to do is

463
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,580
identify key individuals in appropriate

464
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:59,490
business units and craft targeted spear

465
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:02,250
phishing emails after they click the

466
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,920
link hopefully we're going to elevate

467
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:07,770
access to the point that it's possible

468
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:13,560
to sign malicious code and the final use

469
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:15,690
case is product or technology testing so

470
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,120
one example would be testing the data

471
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,070
synchronization mechanisms and the

472
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,770
protocol between the company network and

473
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,929
their air-gapped recovery system we

474
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,510
could also test the recovery procedure

475
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:32,040
and verify the integrity and the

476
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:37,800
recovery system can't be affected when

477
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:39,720
performing those procedures so some

478
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,700
benefits of adversarial simulation or

479
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,160
event timing well we're gonna have

480
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,090
extensive technology coverage right so

481
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,470
we're going to test the traditional

482
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,959
attack surface right so network

483
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,340
application and wireless but then we're

484
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,400
also going to look at

485
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:59,000
non-traditional technologies like ICS

486
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,140
SCADA we can do cloud we can do mobile

487
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,810
we're definitely going to incorporate

488
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,880
threat intelligence we're going to use

489
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:09,240
multiple threat intelligence sources to

490
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,740
provide insight based on threat sources

491
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,840
so we're going to emulate the threats

492
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,970
that may actually pertain to you so if

493
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,370
you're doing business in China or if

494
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:21,780
you're business that's heavily relying

495
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:25,889
on China we could choose to emulate the

496
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:28,770
TTP's of known Chinese actors we can

497
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:31,710
test the process effectiveness not just

498
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,780
the technical symptoms right so since we

499
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:38,880
have a much larger scope we can actually

500
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:41,010
go and test the entire process right now

501
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,910
we can tie it back to a cybersecurity

502
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:46,950
process we can recognize that threats

503
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,540
don't respect boundaries right because

504
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,100
during remember I talked about the

505
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,550
penetration test we had the rules of

506
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,530
engagement we do have rules when we're

507
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:58,560
doing Red Team operations but they're

508
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:01,379
not there aren't as many rules so we can

509
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,830
more closely emulate a real-world

510
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,060
adversary by reducing the amount of

511
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,870
boundaries that we have to subject

512
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:12,120
ourselves to we're also going to address

513
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,889
the human factor of cybersecurity right

514
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,389
a lot of penetration tests and

515
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:18,270
vulnerability assessments aren't going

516
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:20,220
to assess the human factor but in Red

517
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:22,110
Team operations advance address or

518
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:25,500
simulation we're making sure to address

519
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,090
the human factor of cybersecurity we're

520
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,280
going to do social engineering we're

521
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,830
gonna do insider threat and we're going

522
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,580
to do phishing you can also look at

523
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:38,669
automation and integration between tools

524
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:41,419
we can look at the alignment to actual

525
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:43,680
emerging cyber threats not just

526
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,680
compliance requirements so we'll make

527
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,110
sure that we're testing we're testing

528
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,390
systems based on threats that could

529
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,010
actually be posed to them we're not just

530
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,710
going through and doing the OWASP top 10

531
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:58,590
or the CIS top 20 we're actually going

532
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,720
to look at the environment and see what

533
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:06,010
is possible in the environment and try

534
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:08,350
to craft something that is unique

535
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:12,670
would successfully result in

536
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:14,740
accomplishing one of our objectives also

537
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:18,040
we can provide business awareness and

538
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,990
insight because we're going above and

539
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,700
beyond the difficult penetration tests

540
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:23,200
we're getting to know the different

541
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,350
business processes the different

542
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:32,230
functions and therefore we can test the

543
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:33,969
integration between business and IT all

544
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,760
right so I promise maturity model so

545
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:39,460
here we go so adversarial simulation

546
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,129
uses multiple testing techniques to

547
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,410
achieve value so we're gonna focus on

548
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:47,320
performing realistic cyber threat based

549
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:49,960
testing activities with actionable and

550
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,159
value-added results and resulting in

551
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,740
improvements to the client's

552
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,650
capabilities to protect against detect

553
00:24:53,740 --> 00:25:03,010
and respond to cyber attacks so here is

554
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:06,340
the Red Team maturity model so on the

555
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:09,520
bottom on the x-axis we have actually

556
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:12,459
slide to the right the organizational

557
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,490
maturity and the capability to action on

558
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,490
results that they get from one of the

559
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:23,310
three steps is going to increase on the

560
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:27,280
y-axis as we move up the y-axis the

561
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:30,730
analysis and complexity of the test and

562
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:33,280
the environment are going to go up so we

563
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:35,710
can see in the first step we have ulnar

564
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,590
ability assessments so here before we

565
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,180
move to the next step we want to make

566
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:42,250
sure we're doing automated and

567
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,710
vulnerability scans that we have

568
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,230
configuration analysis so we're making

569
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,480
sure everything is configured correctly

570
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,730
and it stays configured correctly we

571
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,250
want to make sure we're integrated with

572
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,990
security operations so everything that

573
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,820
we're doing in a vault in the

574
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,770
vulnerability assessment base and

575
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,090
looking at configuration management

576
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,970
doing all that should be integrated

577
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:06,100
security operations we should also be

578
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,130
conducting code analysis if we're

579
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,110
writing any software and in addition we

580
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,810
should be manually verifying our the

581
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:17,469
existence of our vulnerabilities

582
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:20,260
then once we move to step two we should

583
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:23,890
be performing manual exploitation

584
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:26,950
analysis right we should be validating

585
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:29,890
the existence of our exploits if we have

586
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:33,070
wireless networks we should be engaging

587
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:35,260
in wireless security assessments which

588
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,480
would be beginning to venture down the

589
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:40,210
path of physical and social attack

590
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,420
vectors we should also be looking at

591
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:46,360
business risk integration in the second

592
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:49,930
phase and we should also be testing our

593
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,959
detection and response now once we move

594
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:55,720
into advanced adversary simulation or

595
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,780
red team operations those are going to

596
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,980
be tailored threat driven testing for

597
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,290
your organization

598
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,970
we're going to integrate in the cyber

599
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:06,340
human and physical aspects of

600
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,380
information security and we're going to

601
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,270
have multiple feedback mechanisms and

602
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,800
integrations with key stakeholders to

603
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,620
make sure to keep them in the loop and

604
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,139
to demonstrate that we're adding value

605
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:19,000
we're also going to perform deep

606
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:22,180
exploitation and exfiltration analysis

607
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,760
now when we're ready for a red team

608
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:27,340
we're going to have scenario based

609
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,470
analysis right so one of the things that

610
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:33,149
sets red teaming apart is that it's

611
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:36,400
scenario based so somebody can say hey

612
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:38,140
ok let's say a soda company comes and

613
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,240
hires to you the soda company it's not

614
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,910
going to come and tell you hey go get

615
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,810
domain admin they're gonna tell you ok

616
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:50,920
go steal the secret formula for secret

617
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:52,810
soda pop and also turn the bottling

618
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,760
machine off without anybody noticing so

619
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:58,540
they'll give they'll give objective and

620
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,840
scenario based that's how that's how the

621
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,980
results are based we want to have

622
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,350
objective and scenario based outcomes

623
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:08,710
we're also going to start involving our

624
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:12,280
blue team once we get into the red team

625
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:14,860
operations maturity level we're going to

626
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,920
want to as I said before engage in

627
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,810
threat actor profiling and emulation so

628
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,400
if your business if your business or

629
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:24,970
your organization has a lot of exposure

630
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,859
to Russia then we could be asked to

631
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:30,320
emulate

632
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:32,570
rushon apt we're also going to do

633
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,399
exfiltration analysis we're gonna see if

634
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,408
you're going to catch us stealing your

635
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,939
stuff so if you're able to see us

636
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:41,929
stealing your stuff then great and then

637
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:45,049
if not that's something that is going to

638
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:46,639
be worked on during this phase of

639
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:48,079
maturity right that's something we're

640
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:50,928
gonna be working on since we already

641
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:54,589
have all of the other stuff in other two

642
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:58,279
phases like vulnerability scans basic

643
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:59,719
physical and social attacks exploiting

644
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:03,499
vulnerabilities that's all in previous

645
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:06,979
phases we want to be engaging in cyber

646
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:09,549
war games we want to make sure and we

647
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:12,499
also want to make sure that we have

648
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:14,269
consistent and sustained operations that

649
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:17,359
is the highest level of maturity when

650
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:22,249
we're doing all of this consistent in a

651
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:25,129
consistent and sustained fashion so

652
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:27,769
that's it if you guys have questions I

653
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:29,299
can take a few I don't know if we have

654
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:31,779
time to do it here or I can just do it

655
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:31,779
in slack

656
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,160
I'll go ahead and take a question you

657
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:43,740
actually I mean we're behind but you

658
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:49,000
actually kind of kicked us back in okay

659
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:51,910
yeah I mean anything but if you want to

660
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,880
go into flack

661
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:56,440
connect the track net on see if there's

662
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,460
oh somebody SP we're sharing your slides

663
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:03,640
and I don't think they meant like during

664
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:06,670
this talk I think maybe after so you can

665
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,080
yeah you can reach out to me and I'll

666
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:12,250
let you know where you can get a copy

667
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,850
they'll be distributed eventually all
