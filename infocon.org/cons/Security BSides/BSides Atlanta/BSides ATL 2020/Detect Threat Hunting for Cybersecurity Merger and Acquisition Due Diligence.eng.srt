115
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:07,299
hour 25 minutes here we're gonna walk

116
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:08,740
through basically what is cyber security

117
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,570
emanate your diligence why do we do it

118
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,729
how do we do it

119
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,320
and give you a couple of case studies

120
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:17,289
and then we'll be a wee rock and roll

121
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,820
and so that said let's get in Who am I

122
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:20,919
I'm not going to belabor this too much

123
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,050
either you know me or you don't and you

124
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,000
can go back and find this anyway I work

125
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,949
with renditions InfoSec out of Augusta

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,020
Georgia right down the road from Atlanta

127
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:31,440
although now that this is a virtual

128
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,159
conference you know we're gonna wear a

129
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,510
international firm we actually have

130
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,729
people permanently in other countries

131
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,849
and you know their countries outside of

132
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,409
the US so boutique information security

133
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:43,300
consulting firm do a lot of this merger

134
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:45,039
and acquisition due diligence and want

135
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,900
to basically want to share some of our

136
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,639
experiences with that and why it's

137
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,099
important get your thinking about it as

138
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,639
a possible activity that you may either

139
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:57,130
want to engage in yourself or engaging

140
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,099
yourselves or certainly at least think

141
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:02,110
about bringing somebody in to do so

142
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:03,789
agenda why it matters what are the

143
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,009
techniques for it what are the

144
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:07,690
challenges around it and Oh buddy are

145
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,490
there some challenges and then we'll

146
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,669
wrap it up basically wrap it up for the

147
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,500
day so you know we talk about why does

148
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,960
cybersecurity due-diligence matter and

149
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,120
I'm not going to not gonna kick somebody

150
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,849
while they're down certainly you know

151
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,409
with the Cova 19 scare you know the

152
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:26,229
hotel industry has been taking a beating

153
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:28,449
and Marriott is definitely my case study

154
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:31,150
here right you may remember last year

155
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:32,860
Marriott announced a breach and the

156
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,320
breach itself came from Starwood

157
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,900
Starwood is a Sheraton and a bunch of

158
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,639
other brands that Marriott bought and

159
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,679
they literally bought a breach that they

160
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,310
brought on the liabilities with those

161
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,890
assets

162
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,450
right and so we talk about why does

163
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,700
cybersecurity do the due diligence

164
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,010
manner because when an organization's

165
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,659
acquired all the assets get transferred

166
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,789
but of course so do the liabilities and

167
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,620
if you think about how normal due

168
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,870
diligence works and normal M&A due

169
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,910
diligence taking cybersecurity out of it

170
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,530
nobody goes through and buys you don't

171
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,300
like look at paper and they're like we

172
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:07,210
attest that we have the following number

173
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,970
of buildings and the following state of

174
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:13,210
these buildings etc nobody does that

175
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,890
that's just ridiculous right and so when

176
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,419
we step back I mean they always send

177
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,830
auditors out to like look at the

178
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,540
condition of the buildings to look at

179
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,370
the physical stock if you're buying a

180
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,870
I'm buying a warehouse for instance

181
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,760
right what is the actual stock on hand

182
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,410
right are the factories in shape if

183
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,030
you're manufacturing massive upgrades

184
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,040
and for some reason the state of

185
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,809
organizations cyber security posture

186
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:36,640
isn't given the same level of attention

187
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:39,840
even though we know now as CCPA I'm the

188
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,250
California consumer Privacy Act GDP are

189
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,349
numerous regulate you know basically on

190
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,360
numerous regulations around data and

191
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,920
data security certainly has huge

192
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,840
liabilities there not to mention the

193
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,510
brand damage that can come from

194
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,669
literally buying a breach right so so

195
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,710
this obviously matters a lot of it is

196
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:59,290
really you know propping that bow or

197
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,479
communicating that value proposition to

198
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,760
chief council chief risk officers right

199
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,460
typically the co-starring chief ops

200
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,020
officer CEOs etc they listen to your

201
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,390
chief risk officers which are typically

202
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,530
attorneys typically lawyers right and

203
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,120
those chief risk officers will

204
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,590
absolutely tell you they don't want to

205
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
be involved in something like this and

206
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,739
they'll explain the risk very well it's

207
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,540
a matter of you getting with a CRO to

208
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,800
get it going so what's one of the big

209
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,890
problems that run into heterogeneous

210
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,330
networks every M&A almost every M&A last

211
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,650
two decades has involved heterogeneous

212
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,479
technologies what Active Directory

213
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,890
version are you want and if you can't

214
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,870
answer this question by the way this is

215
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:34,120
a big one right are you on a functional

216
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,100
level 2008 r2 domain I can't tell you

217
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,830
how often folks come back yeah our

218
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,510
domain controllers are Server 2016 and

219
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,620
I'm like that's not which ad version

220
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,840
Your Honor I think you're telling me

221
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,970
that the version of your server it's

222
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,550
almost like saying which version SSH are

223
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,050
you running right and you're like yeah

224
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,329
I'm on RedHat right well those two

225
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,189
things are both technical terms but they

226
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,270
don't actually mean anything together in

227
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,980
context right

228
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,270
which linux builds do you have do you

229
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,149
have a bunch of Engineers that know

230
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:03,220
Ubuntu and the other organizations are

231
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:04,750
acquiring is all red hat which

232
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,190
workstation versions right

233
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,380
what about VPN and remote access

234
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,870
technologies Oh buddy has this been an

235
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,160
issue recently right and we have a lot

236
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,680
of this stuff that isn't considered

237
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,510
pre-acquisition and and we don't look at

238
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,939
how is the newly acquired network going

239
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,500
to be secured in moderate right you may

240
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,060
not be able to and I'll give you a great

241
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,680
example here I'm not pooping on any

242
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,689
vendors I want to be super clear about

243
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,819
that I absolutely not do it I mean maybe

244
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,320
Oracle right but other than Oracle we're

245
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,740
not gonna like beat up on any vendors

246
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,930
right

247
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,640
Oracle deserves it by the way but anyway

248
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,459
let's say you've got CrowdStrike

249
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,770
right and CrowdStrike you know is you're

250
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:41,199
chosen at big co-write the acquiring

251
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,270
company or that's your chosen EDR right

252
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,740
and crowd starts your josy CrowdStrike

253
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,380
doesn't run on pretty Windows seven

254
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,899
right because it relies on dotnet and if

255
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,330
you've got a bunch of technologies

256
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:54,130
legacy technologies in your to be

257
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,450
acquired Network obviously we need to

258
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,149
secure those and we need to monitor

259
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:00,970
those and simultaneously my chosen tool

260
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:02,529
right can't do it and so this obviously

261
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,360
something I need to consider how I'm

262
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:05,920
going to how I'm going to bring that

263
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,200
together and how I'm gonna secure if

264
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,390
we're on backdated active directory

265
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,100
versions I can't just join our domains

266
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,750
together right maybe there's a reason

267
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,579
you're on functional level 2008 domain

268
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,700
even though ours is functional level

269
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:20,920
2016 I may not be it's not as trivial as

270
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:25,120
as folks like to make it seem so

271
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,920
techniques for cyber security M&A cyber

272
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,779
security M&A do diligence how do we do

273
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,149
it right obviously this is a problem I

274
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:33,220
had everybody convinced here because it

275
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:34,990
was easy this is what you do you do

276
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,029
cyber security you don't want to see

277
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,440
this you know see this all fall apart

278
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:39,970
especially because it's gonna be your

279
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,010
job to go clean it up right I don't

280
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,680
remember who the actual live person is

281
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,290
behind the df' our dfi our janitor

282
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,000
account on twitter but i love a train

283
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,890
dfi are being digital forensics and it's

284
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,420
a response and they refer themselves as

285
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,770
a janitor and I absolutely love it

286
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,990
because we are the ones that end up

287
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,089
cleaning the pile poo when poop hits the

288
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,430
fan all right so we want to make sure

289
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:04,180
that this doesn't this isn't an issue

290
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,529
that we run into now M&A threat hunting

291
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,060
is different than traditional throughout

292
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,860
hunting in literally every way

293
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,630
traditional throw who uses AI

294
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,610
season baseline deviations and my

295
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,980
friends I am here to tell you that

296
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,320
baselining takes time and it isn't easy

297
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,480
and if you ever try to deploy UVA or

298
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,400
you'ii be a software user environment

299
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,650
baseline analytics or sorry behavior

300
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,060
analytics with minimal false positives

301
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,620
you know this can't be done right

302
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,390
there's no such thing as minimal false

303
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,040
positives of this there's less false

304
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,780
positives but was less mean right

305
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,849
minimal okay right doesn't happen

306
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,339
baselines are hard to generate under the

307
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,590
best of circumstances but the reality is

308
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,480
that when I'm hopping in to a network

309
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,950
where I'm trying to temporarily monitor

310
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,590
and temporarily threat hunt around this

311
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,850
network it's just not gonna happen then

312
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,470
I'm gonna be able to go generate these

313
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,560
baselines or I would love to do it I

314
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,240
just can't right secondarily I need in

315
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,209
order to hunt I'm gonna usually need to

316
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,680
go deploy software like endpoint agents

317
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,120
sorry and then I need a central server

318
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,949
or any firewall rules to allow these

319
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,590
communications this is not something

320
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:04,690
that's trivial to accomplish right again

321
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,760
super trivial when you build it out as

322
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,170
part of a larger program I said super

323
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,910
trivial then this thing is trivial

324
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,099
threat hunting but it's easier when you

325
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,050
build it as part of a larger program but

326
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,660
doing it temporarily right for the

327
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,540
purpose of evaluating risk in this

328
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,819
network to be purchased maybe right it

329
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,520
is a super difficult challenge right so

330
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,890
again we lack baselines we lack systems

331
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,270
for hunting iOS C's on endpoints IOC

332
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,610
scanning systems aren't easy to deploy

333
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,290
we could try to build baselines but that

334
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,000
gets cost prohibitive these are

335
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,250
pre-purchase investigations this is

336
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,320
trying to determine do we actually want

337
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,970
to complete the sale now usually they've

338
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,950
already determined a price or at least a

339
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,750
tentative price but but again there's

340
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,880
not a big interest undertaking huge

341
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,860
cybersecurity projects just to determine

342
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,550
whether or not that valuation that price

343
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,290
of the organization holds and so what

344
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,430
about tooling right you cannot count on

345
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,709
the organization's having their own

346
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,560
drawing typically M&A is you have a big

347
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:02,050
Co trying to purchase small Co and and

348
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,150
by the way there's another third party

349
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,459
here called spin Co because very often

350
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,680
when big Co by small Co they're buying

351
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,360
it for a specific piece in spinning off

352
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,010
the rest it is something that they have

353
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,020
evaluated that is of interest to them

354
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,670
and the rest of it Jenner interesting or

355
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,650
profitable to them the rest is generally

356
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,209
not there to spin that off and so this

357
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,400
is another place where I can't count on

358
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,690
this smaller Co having its own cooling

359
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,300
even then

360
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,010
I may be asked to look at very specific

361
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,050
areas of the network

362
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,610
ideally remain code right so it's a

363
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,290
small code the piece of it that's

364
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,150
remaining versus pin code they don't

365
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,459
really care so much about right because

366
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,800
literally they're going to buy a either

367
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,750
buy it and spin-off the chunk or only

368
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,550
buy the chunk of it as it's being spa

369
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,500
right getting buy-in for installing

370
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,510
agent based products is problematic and

371
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,950
honestly most vendors don't license

372
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,110
their stuff for this anyway right so

373
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:52,060
even going to a lot of your vendors to

374
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,370
be like hey I I need to buy ten thousand

375
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,020
agents or a thousand agents and even for

376
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,850
thirty days and don't look at you like

377
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,620
you're nuts you're absent I'm buying it

378
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,660
like that the vendors that will work

379
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,790
with you typically it's cost prohibitive

380
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,530
it's not very flexible right so this is

381
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,839
this is very difficult it's gonna rely

382
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,520
on my tooling because I can't count on I

383
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,190
really can't count on the organization

384
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,810
having their own so what do we do take

385
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,850
nothing else away from this talk these

386
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,770
are the techniques that we use right and

387
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,240
at a very high level and I'm short on

388
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,160
time so we're not gonna be able to dive

389
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,930
into each one of these in like super

390
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,430
detail all right but I'll walk through

391
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,219
and these slides are gonna be available

392
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,140
afterwards and good right so we're gonna

393
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,060
start by reviewing security practices I

394
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,370
want to know at a minimum what do you

395
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,260
have on paper how do you work

396
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,000
is there a SEM and if not how our logs

397
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,800
monitor if you tell me that your system

398
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,350
admins are going to reviewing logs for

399
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,329
security events I'm calling baloney

400
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,620
the first thing I want to do ain't

401
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,240
calling baloney depending where you come

402
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,890
from north or south sometimes that's

403
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,810
calling shenanigans whatever right

404
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,060
bottom line I'm calling shenanigans I

405
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,530
want to know how are your logs being

406
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,869
monitored right and if you tell me your

407
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,400
system admins are tell me their system

408
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,070
admins are monitoring those logs they

409
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,720
were doing log review no problem right I

410
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,370
pull a couple of system admins in the

411
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,750
room do some interviews and I just asked

412
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,550
what are you looking for in the logs and

413
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,930
usually I hear words like hackers and

414
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,550
I'm like what does a hacker look like I

415
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,660
want you to tell it to me like you tell

416
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,000
it to my mom all right

417
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,650
my mom is horrible attacks you can bring

418
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,930
a phone from 30 feet just by looking at

419
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,610
it that's the level of explanation I

420
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,140
want system admins generally can't

421
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:23,170
provide it this is not a knock on them

422
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,939
but it does help us evaluate the truth

423
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,680
of the statements right when they say

424
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,630
yes we have a log review program I'm

425
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,030
able to go back to my constituent and

426
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,980
say this is what that really meant right

427
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,819
we reviewed their log review program and

428
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,770
Wow

429
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,579
does it hurt right we want to know about

430
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,739
oddball unit

431
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:46,299
Cicero's because these are huge support

432
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:49,149
issues if you've gots coordinate all

433
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:52,540
right legacy systems again a lot of my

434
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:54,549
security platforms cannot run on these

435
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,980
legacy systems so simultaneously my most

436
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:58,569
vulnerable the population right the most

437
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,999
vulnerable things in the population

438
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:03,309
unfortunately we can't get good

439
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:05,230
monitoring across attackers know this

440
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:07,329
they will spend their time embedding

441
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,970
themselves there and as a result you

442
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:12,099
need to spend time hunting their network

443
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,989
traffic after an IDs right you need to

444
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,989
install Network apps and collect network

445
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:18,129
traffic run an IDs done right I'm not

446
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:19,239
gonna spend too much time on this

447
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:20,410
because there's not that much about it

448
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:22,779
but you're gonna have to bring your own

449
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,749
taps period because almost nobody has

450
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:27,009
them at these smaller company levels

451
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:28,660
never traffic capture I don't wanna

452
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:29,769
identify unmanaged endpoints the

453
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,420
environment I want to look at

454
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:33,549
business-to-business VPNs they are a

455
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,709
huge source of risk for organizations

456
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:38,379
the big takeaway here

457
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:40,839
go grab Andy Andy Greenberg wrote a

458
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:43,299
great book called sandworm go get a copy

459
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,860
of it it's freaking awesome and he walks

460
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:46,269
through the not Pecha attacks and

461
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,029
sandworms and learns about a lot more

462
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:50,709
than not Pecha but it's outstanding

463
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:52,329
outstanding talk there and he even

464
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,669
touches on the business-to-business VPN

465
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:57,969
side because that is a huge part of how

466
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:59,619
not Pecha spread for those b2b VPNs then

467
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,449
we do vulnerability scanning and i want

468
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:03,669
to do some of my own bone scans right i

469
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:05,168
want to see what's what we're looking at

470
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:07,089
here what is the overall security

471
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:09,220
posture of the network right now there's

472
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,869
a lot of the there's a lot of extra

473
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,459
stuff that we can do here there's a lot

474
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:14,289
of additional things that we can do for

475
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:16,269
instance looking to see even if

476
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:18,459
something's fully patched today i can do

477
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,539
some quick forensics and it's super

478
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:21,519
quick forensics because they have the

479
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,408
tooling port on host to tell when did

480
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,750
you get serious about patching because i

481
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:27,939
want to know if you just threw a new

482
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,159
coat of paint right or forgive the term

483
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:32,080
here lipstick on a pig right i need to

484
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:34,510
know that because that's gonna tell me i

485
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,010
see a question the chat there it's andy

486
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,260
greenberg sandworm is the name of the

487
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,700
book hit it on amazon anyway we want to

488
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,158
know if somebody just put lipstick on a

489
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,419
pig and kept rolling right on so a

490
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:45,970
triple threat hunting this is another

491
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:47,350
thing that we do look i can't touch all

492
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,450
the hosts here i don't have that kind of

493
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,139
time it's not a regular threat hunting

494
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,450
ever

495
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,529
and so threat honey is easiest to start

496
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,840
with on the network and that's gonna

497
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:57,370
help me vector into where to go collect

498
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,168
endpoint data now there are some

499
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,510
high-value targets we collect endpoint

500
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:03,789
data from anyway memory forensics is the

501
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,500
tip top end of that to go hunt down

502
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,580
those memory residence rats alright so

503
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
you can think about this like the base

504
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,080
of a pyramid or network threat coming

505
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,600
across everything we are then moving an

506
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,158
endpoint data on a very limited number

507
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,418
of hosts and then memory forensics on

508
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,090
onesie twosie

509
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:20,830
right bad that kind of thing so again

510
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,168
start with a network move up the stack

511
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,689
moving for residual risk from breaches a

512
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:28,299
huge percent of breaches repeat after me

513
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,820
breaches are not completely remediated

514
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:33,490
routinely horrible horrible horrible

515
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,720
right so threat hunting what I want to

516
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,840
look at here is one I want to identify

517
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,690
residual malware but I also want to go

518
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,908
in and look at the regulatory liability

519
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,950
for improperly recorded breaches this is

520
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:47,409
a huge one for us because we have seen

521
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,019
repeatedly or an organization either out

522
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:51,429
of ignorance or malice does not report a

523
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:53,950
breach to the appropriate regulatory

524
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:55,570
authorities and guess what when you buy

525
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,090
that organization you bought that

526
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:00,220
liability too and if they forgot to

527
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,110
report or didn't report or whatever

528
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,820
right you now are stuck with it you need

529
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,949
to go review that yourself and determine

530
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,720
with your chief counsel do you think

531
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,070
this needs to be done is this something

532
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,990
that hadn't have been reported to the

533
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,120
regulatory authority that's something

534
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:17,200
it's absolutely critical to understand

535
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,000
so Sakho an M&A challenges right look

536
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,289
the organization under evaluation they

537
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,149
have an incentive to be less than

538
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:24,700
completely forthcoming about their cyber

539
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:26,199
hygiene now by law they absolutely have

540
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,789
to write in the agreements they

541
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,279
absolutely have to communicate clearly

542
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:32,260
with you but oh brother the people

543
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:34,690
filling out those pay phone out that M&A

544
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,279
paperwork they are being truthful to the

545
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,990
best of their knowledge I'm air quoting

546
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,909
here right I'll tell you that what

547
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,830
appears to be deceived in most cases an

548
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:43,659
extension of existing communication

549
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,370
problems between line workers and

550
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:47,019
management right if you go into any

551
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,418
organization today forget one that's

552
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,889
under M&A any organization today and you

553
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:53,529
ask management how their cybersecurity

554
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:55,629
about good and then you go to your

555
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:57,639
practitioners right how's your cyber

556
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,529
skirt like horrible kind of thing right

557
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:02,199
they know where the bodies are buried go

558
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:03,429
talk to your text right I'll tell you

559
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,929
another thing is that a lot of folks

560
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:06,269
reduced

561
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:08,460
prior to M&A they try to basically

562
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:09,869
adjust their profit wash sheet and what

563
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,460
they'll do here is I'll try to cut cost

564
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:13,350
that comes in the form of software it

565
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,049
comes to the form of services comes in

566
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,219
the form of staff and again at the end

567
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:20,129
of the day the results here are

568
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,110
predictable InfoSec and ITR cost centers

569
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:24,029
not profit centers and you can run with

570
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,580
technical debt for a while whatever a

571
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:28,019
while is before it catches up to you you

572
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,749
want to know if that's been done you

573
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,100
want to understand the impact of that

574
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:34,679
poor asset inventory another big issue

575
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,748
here all organizations not just M&A have

576
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,070
issues asset inventory but I will tell

577
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,149
you this is a big one for us there's

578
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,470
another reason that we bring in those

579
00:20:39,149 --> 00:20:42,479
Network caps and start looking

580
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,909
east-west I don't just want to scan

581
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,190
endpoints and subnets identified by IT I

582
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:48,899
want to go find my own and we do a lot

583
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,119
of router config review we do a lot of

584
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:52,590
firewall configuration review this helps

585
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,299
us find other subnets we do a lot of

586
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,039
passive traffic monitoring those network

587
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:57,389
taps and again we have to bring our own

588
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,490
now if you're thinking like hey this is

589
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:02,820
an easy thing to get going I can tell

590
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:05,759
you that we have in calculus of money a

591
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:08,340
rendition tied up in property that is at

592
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,110
different network caps and pivot boxes

593
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,519
and servers that we can send you can't

594
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,469
send somebody a half rack of equipment

595
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,730
and be like hey find power space and

596
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,710
cooling for this you have to find

597
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,690
portable equipment as well as have your

598
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,360
own taps and your software licenses and

599
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:22,559
it is just maddening the amount of money

600
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,090
you have to put into this on the front

601
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,129
end so I just want to throw out here

602
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,809
like on the poor asset inventory side it

603
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:30,330
is really hard to get this done in the

604
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:32,039
best of times it is crazy hard to do

605
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,779
this when you're trying to drop or

606
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,940
perish it into an organization and do it

607
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:38,759
for a very temporary time and then

608
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,279
network visibility right again is huge

609
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,019
for us we don't have you know a V or

610
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,539
endpoint protection systems in some

611
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:47,490
cases or it's just antivirus knows we

612
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:50,039
don't have a good SEM with our net flow

613
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:52,980
we got EDR this can be super super

614
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,749
difficult to get over right again we

615
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,820
need to come in and figure out how we

616
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:59,190
can enable the organization or enable us

617
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,470
in the context of the organization to

618
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,929
threat hunt around those merger and

619
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,580
acquisition pieces right so again that

620
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:07,080
the bad news my friends is you end up

621
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,960
having to bring your own beer of the

622
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,999
barbecue right this is a this really is

623
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,289
if you want to do this right and you can

624
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,669
do this without doing all right don't

625
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:16,619
get me wrong you can still do a little

626
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:17,290
bit of work but to get the best value

627
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:18,370
out of this

628
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,260
you're gonna have to bring your own

629
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,939
tools and to bring your own licenses

630
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,290
your hardware etc and there's a lot of

631
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,360
considerations that are different again

632
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,129
like I mentioned you know if I'm

633
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,780
deploying to an organization normally

634
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,150
I'm bringing a rack you know basically

635
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,710
rack mounting units here right I'm doing

636
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,330
this I can't bring rack Mountain units

637
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,790
right I have to bring things that are

638
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:39,159
easy on power space and cooling I have

639
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:41,050
to bring network apps you know again all

640
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,730
kinds of stuff that you would think an

641
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,350
organization might already have that

642
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,790
they do not I just I'll just throw it

643
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,679
out there you can't count on having it

644
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:50,350
that that's probably the big one for us

645
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,420
is achieving that visibility enough so

646
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:55,240
that we can provide in the state of the

647
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,950
network back to our constituent so war

648
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,750
stories right let's get some war stories

649
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,360
going here right Michael Bay moments for

650
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,040
the win this one was awesome all right

651
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,889
this is that we forgot about the VMS

652
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,990
right not the BMS I had multiple

653
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,640
analysts correct me air quotes correct

654
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,490
me on the report right where they're

655
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,410
like hey if you could stop capitalizing

656
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,270
S&V ends that would be awesome I'm like

657
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,550
it would be but I'm not talking about

658
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,129
VMs I'm talking about freaking VMs and

659
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:23,080
if you don't know what VMs is you are in

660
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,950
good company because a lot of analysts

661
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,740
today don't either

662
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,600
this is literally like backing up into

663
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,420
the wayback machine right I see some

664
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,669
comments there Lola Wolvie MS exactly

665
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,680
right so our scanning scope is limited

666
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:38,050
due to ICS devices this is a huge one

667
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,730
this is a big ICS network we only found

668
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,379
this due to on-site interviews and data

669
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,830
center business I literally walked into

670
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,420
a data center and there were yes Andy we

671
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,659
are absolutely officially old there is

672
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,880
no question there no question right so I

673
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,340
walk in and there's an alpha server

674
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,050
actually to alpha servers sitting one of

675
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,300
them has the lid off of it I'm sitting

676
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:01,330
in the corner of this data center and

677
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,860
I'm like oh hey guys you know not too

678
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,500
good at taking the trash out they're

679
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:08,709
like oh that's our parts server right

680
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,460
parts server right and it used to be and

681
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,740
I kid you not

682
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,900
it used to be their staging server and

683
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,700
now they only have a dev and a prod they

684
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,800
no longer have a staging server because

685
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,210
they can't get parts for these and they

686
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,639
literally have to pull the staging

687
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:24,040
server out of production right so this

688
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,900
is huge by the way right VMs does not

689
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,920
run an emulator as a VM not not the way

690
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,870
they needed to run my friend

691
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,580
unfortunately right so the organization

692
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,070
repeatedly tried to move off the legacy

693
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,870
EMS servers they failed each time right

694
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,950
this is actually in an alpha you talk

695
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,539
about an emulator we're talking about

696
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,370
alpha chip here right so this if you

697
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:41,830
don't know what alpha is drop back it's

698
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,658
Dec alpha they had failed multiple times

699
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,519
here seven million dollar expense right

700
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:47,440
over three failed attempts you'd better

701
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,059
believe a hundred percent this is a risk

702
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,549
to the organization was not disclosed

703
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:53,080
I'm just gonna tell you this is yeah

704
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:54,850
somebody's like this YC nineties

705
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,428
motherboard selling for dollars on eBay

706
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,799
heck yes right absolutely

707
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:02,889
saga the BBB VPNs initially I was told

708
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:05,860
there were none none eventually we found

709
00:25:02,889 --> 00:25:09,250
or quickly found five always-on VPNs

710
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:11,110
with no filtering wide-open right and

711
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,450
I'm not gonna say target here but I am

712
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,070
alright target you may remember right

713
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:18,299
was a supply chain attack that the

714
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:20,559
target compromised came in through the

715
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,570
basic came in through an HVAC vendor

716
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,460
huge problem here once but mara and his

717
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,629
VPN connections it was clear the

718
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,429
confidential data was being

719
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,799
systematically siphoned from the

720
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:32,289
organization's ERP system from a remote

721
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:34,120
site right this is a huge huge issue no

722
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:36,639
threat hunting alone I want to be clear

723
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,129
if I go to IOC sweeps I don't find this

724
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:41,379
right we only found this because we're

725
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,090
doing good network monitoring again I'm

726
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,100
not saying that you only do threat honey

727
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,689
or only do network monitoring this is a

728
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,580
you have to do it all you have to bring

729
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:50,950
a lot of stuff together here it's not

730
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,080
easy it's not always cheap but man do we

731
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,720
I can tell you consistently we save

732
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,549
organizations more in there I will tell

733
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,860
you consistently we save organizations

734
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:01,539
way more their valuation than the cost

735
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,979
of the actual assessment by the way the

736
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:05,500
cost of the assessment is borne by

737
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,460
typically borne by the company to be

738
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:11,200
acquired and if they have made material

739
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,480
misrepresentations in their material

740
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,500
misrepresentations in their basically

741
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,929
their questionnaires and their

742
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,429
disclosures typically you know there's

743
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:20,110
no refund around if the organization

744
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:22,510
decides to pull out so this is a

745
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:25,178
no-brainer for big co if you structure

746
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:28,179
this correctly it's free to you and only

747
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:29,860
reduces the value right my final one

748
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:31,570
here is the sure we were mediated very

749
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,610
intake the org said they experienced one

750
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:36,220
major instant ransomware in the previous

751
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,928
36 month 36 months and I went in and did

752
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,370
on-site interviews the staff and by the

753
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,220
way if you don't know how to interview

754
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:45,010
people slash interrogate take a class on

755
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,840
this or find somebody from former

756
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,490
who knows this and has been trained in

757
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,100
this but I will tell you your best

758
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:53,590
tactic in in you know basically doing

759
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:56,590
these interrogations slash interviews is

760
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:58,720
silence just go silent and they will

761
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:01,090
review they will absolutely provide you

762
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,830
data and it's awesome bottom line they

763
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:06,699
fail to remediate we found about other

764
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:07,179
apt intrusions and done so this is where

765
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,950
I'm out

766
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,020
as far as wrap it up these are my

767
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,120
conclusion bullets I don't really have

768
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,470
time for a lot of questions here because

769
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,389
you know I'm running right up to the end

770
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:18,490
of my time here but look seriously I

771
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:21,010
want to thank you know thank everybody

772
