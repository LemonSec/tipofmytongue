00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:38,039
hypothetical trades at a previous date

143
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:40,889
and testing to see how they turned out

144
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,498
today I can you hear theories like

145
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,179
selling name go away so you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

146
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:46,919
myth in the market for the first five

147

months of the year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then get out and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">tell the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next January so you can look at</font>

149
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,459
cyclical things and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works or</font>

150
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:57,839
not so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do hypothetically</font>

151
00:06:53,459 --> 00:07:01,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">speaking is short sell 100 shares at the</font>

152
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:05,399
market on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> close of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the market on the</font>

153
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:06,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">day of the day of the breach so short</font>

154
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,819
selling for those<font color="#E5E5E5"> that aren't familiar</font>

155
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:11,219
with the market you borrow a hundred

156
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,779
shares from your broker you sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at</font>

157
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:14,639
the current price you hope the stock

158
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,860
drops you buy it back at a lower price

159
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,569
pocketing the difference and then you

160
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,189
give those shares back to your broker

161
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:26,729
and what we found here is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

162
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:29,039
2011 is that very few companies have

163
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:30,508
actually gotten hurt and have you

164
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,959
actually done this which I don't

165
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:35,429
recommend is that you would be down 55

166
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,800
thousand five hundred seventy four

167
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:38,998
dollars assuming<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you shorted 100</font>

168
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,389
shares of each<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these companies</font>

169
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:44,699
every time they ended up in the news so

170
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:47,069
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you should be</font>

171
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:51,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">buying the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> div hypothetically rather</font>

172
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:52,860
than shorting it so you know you're

173
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:55,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably thinking women you lost how</font>

174
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,539
much money by doing this we thought they

175
00:07:55,679 --> 00:08:00,958
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> going out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of business they should</font>

176
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:04,829
be a surefire thing well it<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns out</font>

177
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:07,349
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different in the market</font>

178
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:08,849
please direct your attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

180
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:13,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a little difficult to read so</font>

181
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:17,129
what we did was we<font color="#CCCCCC"> took a look at target</font>

182
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:20,248
<font color="#CCCCCC">and x RT x RT is the entire retail</font>

183
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:22,379
sector exchange-traded fund you know so

184
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:25,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a bucket of retail companies and</font>

185
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:28,740
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the time frame around</font>

186
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:31,289
the breach<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know we can</font>

187
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,969
yeah target performed lower than the

188
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:35,819
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the retail industry but there's</font>

189
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:40,260
not the big divergence with a sharp

190
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,270
vertical drop in the stock price so this

191
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,919
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of says that things are flat</font>

192
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,250
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing really going on there</font>

193
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,610
but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's take a look at target</font>

194
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:55,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">after the bridge so this is from Black</font>

195
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:58,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">Friday into you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the preceding</font>

196
00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:00,180
quarter and you know you say oh well let

197
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,779
me get hacked<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stock prices it's</font>

198
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,520
going down and it hit an all-time low

199
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:08,279
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> several things here</font>

200
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,490
when you dig into this chart that stand

201
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:14,670
out number one is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the implied</font>

202
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,709
volatility statistic up in the upper

203
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,140
left hand corner and this mouse is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

204
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:23,160
going to work it is twenty-five percent

205
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:26,580
and what we have here is we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a gap</font>

206
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,130
on earnings day so that says the target

207
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,880
feed expectations you have a gap

208
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:34,560
whenever you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opening price is</font>

209
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,450
significantly higher than the previous

210
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">day's close</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so people were buying this</font>

211
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:42,870
thing like crazy and it's just taken off

212
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:45,209
since then so that's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> indication of</font>

213
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,990
something that's really hurting implied

214
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:51,449
volatility is the supply demand for

215
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,029
derivative options you know so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

216
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,920
insurance you know put options in the

217
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:58,890
market so people were not<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying</font>

218
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,380
insurance on their portfolios expecting

219
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,000
things to go really south now only look

220
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,670
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> walmart oh my god that looks exactly</font>

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,410
the same did I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same chart oh no</font>

222
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:11,160
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are these are two different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> charts</font>

223
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,569
that's interesting so yeah implied

224
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,579
volatility is twenty-three percent

225
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,130
Walmart's a bigger company so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

226
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:19,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that they would do better you know</font>

227
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,910
not surprising there but look at this we

228
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,190
a gap down so as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as Wall Street's</font>

229
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,260
concerned even though target got hacked

230
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,230
they're doing better than walmart so

231
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,389
here you had the price open lower from

232
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,079
the previous day there's a small gap in

233
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:37,389
between here now let's look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the whole</font>

234
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:39,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">market gosh did I get my charts mixed up</font>

235
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:43,029
again because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this looks like Target and</font>

236
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:48,519
Lord you know let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back yeah they do</font>

237
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:50,380
look a lot alike<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if we follow</font>

238
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,709
the hypothesis the whole retail<font color="#CCCCCC"> sector</font>

239
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,839
must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gotten hacked and this here is</font>

240
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:58,029
very interesting the implied volatility

241
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,389
statistic is<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty two percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

242
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:04,959
is twice the risk of the entire retail

243
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:06,790
sector versus either target or war now

244
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,550
if we think back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas shopping</font>

245
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,860
season 2013 you know we have the polar

246
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,990
vortex going on it was cold people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

247
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,750
the Northeast couldn't get out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

248
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:20,620
houses so okay this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably to be</font>

249
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:24,519
expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> that things you know win South</font>

250
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:27,069
during the shopping season now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

251
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,589
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Target today and we got the</font>

252
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:32,319
breach all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here you know</font>

253
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:35,610
they are up about 20 bucks from their

254
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:39,250
load during the bad shopping<font color="#E5E5E5"> season</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

255
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:42,220
2013 and you know Market Watch says that

256
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,800
their black friday sales are up forty

257
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,010
percent if this does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sound like a</font>

258
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,620
company whose customers are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

259
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:54,399
leave them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they're not the</font>

only ones out there you know home depot

262
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:04,269
gone up quite a bit high at 170 dollars

263
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,970

282
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:58,279
breach and we've already<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a bullish</font>

283
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:00,500
trend line in here and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can</font>

284
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,330
clearly see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stock bounced off</font>

285
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,790
of this didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anywhere for</font>

286
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:07,930
the rest of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day but the interesting</font>

287
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:15,800
thing is this purchase right here

288
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:19,160
somebody bought 50 9898 million dollars

289
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:22,399
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stock of one time you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font>

290
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,319
again would we expect you know this

291
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,149
company to be going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of business if</font>

292
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,100
the professionals this is obviously not

293
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">an individual investor but if the</font>

294
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:34,370
professionals<font color="#E5E5E5"> are plowing this kind of</font>

295
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,380
money into anthem all right and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

296
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:40,790
if we look correlation index here it's

297
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:44,779
highly correlated to the sp500 you know

298
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:46,420
so on days of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sp500 is up anthem is</font>

299
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:49,700
typically up it's just one of those

300
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,500
staple stocks that tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do well here</font>

301
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,380
we have a horizontal<font color="#E5E5E5"> trend so we have</font>

302
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,029
double top stock went below that bounced

303
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:00,980
above it and you notice it bounces off

304
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:04,070
of it here and continues upwards so we

305
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:08,089
got a bullish channel 50-day SMA is

306
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:10,279
trending upward we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac be moving</font>

average Convergence divergence bullish

308
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:15,079
crossover about to occur again the

309
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,579
relative strength indicator is starting

310
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,670
to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and this thing's probably</font>

311
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:20,660
got some legs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run a little further</font>

312
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,050
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get little this horizontal</font>

313
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,610
support you know so it

314
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:27,130
unless something really wild happens

315
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,470
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue up oh and notice</font>

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:34,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the 50-day SMA suddenly turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sharply</font>

317

upwards after they got reached strange

318
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright this one's a little more</font>

319
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,300
difficult to to read so I don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,269
reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> power points but I'll read this</font>

321
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,130
before you this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I press release from</font>

Standard & Poor's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day after staples</font>

323
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:50,890
I got hacked and it says we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen</font>

324
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,880
many instances of payment related data

325
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:56,709
breaches at retailers we rate in all of

326
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,480
these situations<font color="#CCCCCC"> so far the cost</font>

327
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:00,699
companies incur because of these

328
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,180
breaches end up being manageable and

329
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,430
have not had a material impact on credit

330
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:10,000
protection measures or a consumer

331
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:12,279
behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not me up here</font>

332
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,740
is the crazy guy saying up the stuff

333
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:17,829
doesn't matter SP is<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there saying</font>

334
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:20,680
that yeah nobody cares<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that so you</font>

335
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:22,649
know while you're thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

336
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,189
know Santa Claus not being real and

337
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies getting hacked out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of business</font>

338
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:33,220
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> Krampus is you know we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

339
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:37,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what's good what's going on here</font>

340
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,459
well first of all you know the truth of

341
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">the matter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is data breaches aren't</font>

342
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:43,839
really hurting companies today<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

343
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:49,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">just not happening no matter what we've</font>

344
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:52,810
been told and the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite clear</font>

345
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,810
because honey<font color="#E5E5E5"> badger don't care in an</font>

346
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,069
experience survey<font color="#CCCCCC"> one third of customers</font>

347
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,649
after receiving a breach notification

348
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,540
letter said they did nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they</font>

349
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:04,000
didn't proactively call the bank and say

350
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,069
cancel my card anything like that well

351
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,140
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really too surprising because</font>

352
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,870
since a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were foreclosed on</font>

353
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,430
a few years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago by the same banks that</font>

354
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,990
have the credit cards I'm sure a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

355
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,459
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually going to the stores</font>

356
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were breached and saying oh please</font>

357
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:21,790
steal this number I want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

358
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:23,160
these guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright but real really one</font>

359
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,839
reason consumers don't

360
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,519
err aside from the hypothetical reach

361
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,370
fatigue that we keep hearing about is

362
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,079
the Fair Credit Billing Act limits

363
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,670
unauthorized charges<font color="#E5E5E5"> 250 dollars now</font>

364
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,199
most all of you have probably gotten a

365
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,110
letter from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your credit card companies</font>

366
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:40,139
that say oh we cover you down to zero

367
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,839
dollars you owe nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what's</font>

368
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:45,930
the incentive for being careful shopping

369
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:47,939
online or you know caring if the number

370
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,439
gets stolen from<font color="#E5E5E5"> retailer not your</font>

371
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:51,230
problem it's the people of foreclosed on

372
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:55,620
your house it's their problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

373
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:57,839
so yeah what does cause pain well Batman

374
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:02,279
is well known for<font color="#CCCCCC"> causing pain but not</font>

375
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:05,839
in this particular case so again we have

376
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to beat up an automatic because</font>

377
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:18,888
so if oil rig<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's really going</font>

378
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:20,898
that are hurt your<font color="#E5E5E5"> stock and your</font>

379
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:23,359
company's reputation you know if you get

380
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:25,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">your a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of credit card stolen or</font>

social<font color="#CCCCCC"> security number is stolen that's</font>

382
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:29,240
not something that people are going to

383
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,559
be seeing on the news every day and

384
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,120
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be feeling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

385
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">grocery store whenever the price of</font>

386
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,699
shrimp doubles or you see Greenpeace on

387
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:40,779
TV with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these oil so birds you know</font>

388
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,610
these real-world events are what really

389
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:45,379
hurts<font color="#CCCCCC"> company's reputations and from an</font>

390
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,209
infosec perspective yeah that is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

391
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:49,399
sad because you have other things

392
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,830
competing for people's attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

393
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:54,889
this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bad news sells more news</font>

394
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:59,389
stories than data breaches do another

395
00:17:54,889 --> 00:18:02,799
one that came up in the past week was

396
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:05,928
lumber liquidators so 60 minutes did a

397
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,769
coverage on them once some of their

398
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:12,500
factories and found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they had</font>

399
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:15,440
levels of formaldehyde in their product

400
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:18,200
that exceeded<font color="#CCCCCC"> California EPA levels so</font>

401
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,179
put this flooring in your house and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

402
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,440
you got all these toxic fumes coming out

403
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:26,779
that exceed the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> appropriate</font>

404
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,730
levels stock drops by<font color="#E5E5E5"> one fifty percent</font>

405
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:34,070
you can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that lumber liquidators got</font>

406
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:36,019
hammer haha alright till till somebody

407
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:39,860
who's been shorting them for many<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

408
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:42,289
has continued to short them and you know

409
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,789
they run out of shares too short there

410
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:45,230
are so many short positions out there

411
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,960
you can't find any stock to borrow to

412
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,460
shortlist thing hit more so this one may

413
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,970
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero but they didn't have a data</font>

414
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:57,110
breach so you're probably still thinking

415
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:59,659
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know but you know lymphocyte Press</font>

416

says that CEOs get fired and we have to

420
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,049
least I got the card cut going alright

421
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:16,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">so the financial reality of what</font>

422
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:20,039
happened you know with target is that

423
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,870
they had a pre-tax loss of almost six

424
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,390
billion dollars you know Walmart ran

425
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,580
into the same problem whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

429
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,159
underestimate the complexities you know

430
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:33,360
special<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're in retail supply</font>

431
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,080
chains and other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are more</font>

432
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">expensive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font>

433
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,970
that in the Wall Street Press they<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

434
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:44,070
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot about this misguided adventure</font>

435
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,600
into Canada you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a few stories</font>

436
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,428
mentioned like one or two lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

437
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,689
the data breach but when we look at what

438
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:54,059
gets people fired you know do you lose

439
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:58,640
5.4 billion or you know the data breach

440
00:19:54,059 --> 00:20:02,908
was 0.19 1 billion with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> insurance</font>

441
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:06,510
coverage of 0.46 billion so you had a

442
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:10,530
pre-tax loss of 0.1 45 billion against

443

<font color="#CCCCCC">top-line revenue of 72.6 18 billion in</font>

446
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,970
know nothing significant and as SP said

447
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,949
that's not material but when we do have

448
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:26,390
a fundamental analysis of what's going

449
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">on you know we look at the q4 earnings</font>

453
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:41,250
on earnings per share q4 sales were up

454
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,350
for twenty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it should be</font>

negative of customers early leaving

456
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:48,178
full-year sales are one-point-three

percent in store and online sales are up

458

thirty percent you know antara<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shea as</font>

459
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,210
they used call its kind of lost its

460
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,940
panache you know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people aren't</font>

461
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">really shopping there you know compared</font>

462
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,830
to what it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago big tell</font>

463
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:04,710
for me though is that they increase the

464
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,510
dividend 19.8 percent and they paid out

465
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:10,510
1.2 billion dollars to talk to

466
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:13,910
stockholders yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not block number</font>

467
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:17,240
picked out and they're less short-term

468
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:19,010
than my 50 oh yeah I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> kept up</font>

469

take control you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interest</font>

473
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,640
finding the numbers more interesting but

474
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:33,170
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to board replacement in just</font>

475
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,960
a moment you guys will find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

476
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:38,809
interesting so home depot according to

477
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:42,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">their earnings call they carry a hundred</font>

478
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:45,770
million in cyber insurance and their

479
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,740
gross breach expenses before insurance

480
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:52,520
for 63 million and after insurance

481
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:55,160
that's 33 million against 83,000 million

482
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,860
in revenue<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh gee that looks like</font>

483
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,840
another rounding error<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so earnings</font>

484
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,928
per share up for three point eight

485
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,800
percent for<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiscal year 14 up 25.3</font>

486
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:09,590
percent you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so online</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business they</font>

487
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,020
said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's 36 six percent versus</font>

488
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:14,110
last year increase of thirteen percent

489
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:17,120
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> their online business is doubled</font>

490
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:19,159
their and they're also increasing their

491
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,219
dividend by twenty six percent so better

492
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:25,280
than a target and they're initiating an

493
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:27,650
18 billion dollar share buyback program

494
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,040
so again you know these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are</font>

495
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,450
apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing everything right</font>

496
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,960
financially anthem is another one that

497
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:39,230
was in the news lately we have not had

498
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,420
an earnings called sense that<font color="#CCCCCC"> breach but</font>

499
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have 200 million in insurance okay</font>

500
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,980
so they got twice as much insurances

501
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,170
everybody else does we are asking to see

502
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,809
the financial impact especially with all

503
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,580
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> binds going on in their stock so you</font>

506
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,340
vendors in the back are going to start

507
00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:00,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">throwing things at me in a moment but</font>

508
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know when we look at what happened</font>

509
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,729
target and home depot they didn't really

510

they're all just reclaiming those

synergies and bottling that into a share

relational investors bought into your

other alternatives so why are we talking

626
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,700
about active investors well after doing

627
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:51,240
a little digging I found a third point

628
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:54,960
LLC and according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> activists investing</font>

631
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,470
good company because the return dan

632
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,260
loeb's getting for his investors of

633
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,250
seven three-point-four percent so you

634
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,370
know where do you go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start</font>

probably say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's some serious</font>

641
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,270
cost-cutting going on at Sony as well

642
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,860
and dan wolf was seriously going after

643

650
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,290
it off into a separate company with

651
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,410
different management they felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

652
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:51,210
Sony's management was not that great so

653
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,690
what Sony did was they compromised and

654
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,360
said

655
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:56,940

656
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,100
enough to get third point out of the way

over the board we couldn't force this

659
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:05,549
spin out so we're selling our stock and

660
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:08,370
we got out for twenty percent well that

661

covenants you know you hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your</font>

676
00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:48,240
equity investors but your debt investors

677
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,610
are really the ones that you have to

678
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,370
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about because they wield a</font>

679
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:55,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of power over your company you know</font>

680
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:58,049
you have restrictions on your loans that

681
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,939
say you have to have a certain debt

682
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:03,059
equity ratio or something like that now

683
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,730
in terms of debt covenants if you

684
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:07,980
violate the Covenant immediately it

685
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:10,440
accelerates the maturity of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the loan</font>

686
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,720
thus the entire balance comes due at one

687
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,820
time oops so if you got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two or three</font>

688
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,159
billion dollar loan the entire balance

689
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,389
comes do they start hitting you a late

690
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:20,669
fees and then they start digging your

691
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:23,189
company's credit and you know that's

692
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:25,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">just one area you know RadioShack went</font>

693
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,769

694

able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell the company because they</font>

695
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:32,279
had a debt covenant in place so they had

to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bank's permission to start</font>

penalties are immense debt covenants are

721
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:39,120
there to enrich the bankers and not the

722
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:41,400
shareholders so<font color="#E5E5E5"> leucadia capital loans</font>

723
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,649
some money to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fxcm there a currency</font>

724
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,020
brokerage so again no data breach but a

725
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,870
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> financial impact so they in the</font>

726
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:50,580
brokerage world if the customers don't

727
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,320
have the money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover losses the</font>

728
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:56,460
brokerage has to pay so they lost 300

729
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,290
million in one day and supplication came

730
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,360
along and said hey will loan you 300

731
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,159
million to your term ten percent

732
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,040
interest and it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> up every quarter</font>

733
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,500
until it hits seventeen percent and then

734
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,120
they can't sell equipment my equipment

735
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,930
or do anything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to l'acadie a</font>

736
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,729
capital first and then if they don't pay

737
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:17,370
the loan off in three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> leucadia can</font>

738
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,020
force a sale<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the company so this is</font>

739
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your debt investors have power</font>

740
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,280
over your equity investors and I just

741
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,800
absolutely love these loan terms here so

742
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,540
let's say they saw the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> leucadia</font>

743
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,870
gets a hundred percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the money to</font>

745
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:36,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sale they get half of it any money</font>

746
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,830
between 350 million and 680 million they

747
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,830
get to keep ninety percent of the money

748
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:43,439
and anything after that they keep sixty

749
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,460
percent so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is thus far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">going to financial conferences years ago</font>

765
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,980
well as you got treasurers an attorney's

766
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,889
sitting up on a panel saying we protect

767

<font color="#CCCCCC">the company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from data breaches may you</font>

772
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:44,760
your insurance is covering you know the

773
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:47,550
consultants to do the forensics you can

774
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,379
get insurance to cover loss revenue as

775
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:51,419
an add-on so at the end of the day with

776
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,670
the proper insurance coverage it's like

777
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:56,610
the surco commercials it's as if nothing

778
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:57,930
ever happened and you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how a</font>

00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,870
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of executives the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">with insurance they're not familiar with</font>

781
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:05,429
you know technology and things like that

782
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:07,590
treasurer comes to them and says yeah we

783
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:10,440
got some cyber risk but I bought a 200

784
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:15,000
million dollar insurance policy and we

785
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:17,700
are covered so what does insurance do

786
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,630
well it's substitutes a qualified

787
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:24,089
promise for uncertainty you know a lot

788
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:26,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people think it's certain but when</font>

789
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:28,560
you look at the contracts that insurance

790
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,480
companies have out there they're going

791
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a lot of exclusions now unlike</font>

792
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,719
homeowners renters or automobile cyber

793
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,360
insurance and general business insurance

794
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,609
is very customized it's not because they

795
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,330
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell you the hole in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the donut</font>

796
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:47,030
not the rest of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> donut it's that</font>

797
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:48,380
company has different needs and you know

798
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:51,530
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to talk to your broker</font>

799
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:54,380
about you know what you can do you know

800
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:55,820
what your put your<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs actually are so</font>

801
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,900
we'll talk a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some of the</font>

802
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:01,940
pitfalls with with insurance you know

803
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,010
cyber typically falls under errors and

804
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,330
omissions you know also<font color="#CCCCCC"> known as</font>

805
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,370
professional liability so it's the same

806
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:10,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">class as if someone slips and gets</font>

807
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:15,049
injured you know or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

808
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:17,660
medical malpractice suit you know some

809
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:18,950
of the terms to be aware of is know the

810
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,170
difference between first party insurance

811
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:24,500
and third party insurance so your first

812
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:27,080
party insurance is going to cover you

813
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,340
know what happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your company so if</font>

814
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,190
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring in a consulting firm</font>

815
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,930
forensics pci stuff like that you know

816
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:36,530
that's covered under first party

817
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:38,690
insurance if you're worried about the

818
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost of breach notification letters</font>

819
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:45,850
things like that that's third party that

820
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:49,310
is a third party that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have wrong in</font>

821
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:51,319
the course of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your business there's a</font>

822
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of exclusions in your standard</font>

823
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:57,440
policy so it says we don't cover

824
00:35:52,940 --> 00:36:00,110
terrorism or military conflict and

825
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,760
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you need you need to</font>

826
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,990
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at the policy language and</font>

827
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,790
this is why you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Treasury</font>

828
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,500
Department and probably an insurance

829
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:09,230
attorney looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> over these things</font>

830
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">because think about if you have five or</font>

831
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,080
six insurance policies a lot of

832
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,210
companies will try to save<font color="#E5E5E5"> money by</font>

833
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,860
getting something with a 20 million

834
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,570
dollar deductible but only covers up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

835
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,860
50 then they'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different policy</font>

836
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:21,260
that has a fifty-million-dollar

837
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,060
deductible covers up to 70 you know

838
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,130
because the risk to that second

839
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,170
insurance company because they have 50

840
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,910
million up front end leeway before they

841
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:30,770
have to pay anything the premium is

842
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,089
going to be a lot lower so sometimes

843
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,290
you're better off going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a single</font>

844
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,820
company other times you're better

845
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:37,220
staffing different insurances now

846
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:39,350
there's a clause in there that<font color="#CCCCCC"> says well</font>

847
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,790
yeah our insurance company goes last and

848
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:43,100
you have a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> insurance company</font>

849
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:45,980
that also says the same thing you're

850
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to end up in court you know suing</font>

851
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,760
both of those insurance companies to

852
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:53,150
figure out who is supposed to pay

853

wait waste of time and energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> do your</font>

854
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:59,390
homework up front insurance companies

855

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pull pull you into buckets</font>

856
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:04,850
based on your industry so if you're a

857
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:07,040
retailer you don't want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

858
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:09,529
insurance from oil drilling company and

859
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,500
vice versa so you know talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

860
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:14,600
insurance broker is you know something

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone should do and if you're</font>

not having the discussions with your

Treasury officer you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about about</font>

00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,549
this stuff you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your assets</font>

865
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:25,820
what information<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have how many</font>

866
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:27,530
customers records could be breached you

867
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:31,250
know the Treasury Department really does

868
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:35,270
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know that common exclusions and</font>

869
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:37,790
gotchas so<font color="#E5E5E5"> insurance is there to replace</font>

870
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:41,120
equipment and other things it will not

871
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:42,980
replace any lost revenue you can buy

872
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,799
that as additional coverage so it's just

873
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:48,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a disability policy you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know so if</font>

874
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have your data center catch on fire</font>

875
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:52,280
or someone breaks in and deletes your

876
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:55,310
entire database tables while you're

877
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,860
restoring you know you can have your

878
00:37:55,310 --> 00:38:00,110
revenue replaced it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same as a</font>

business continuity policy typically

880

these revenue replacement policies will

881
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,870
cover your revenue from the previous

<font color="#E5E5E5">quarter and pay that until you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,799
back up and running<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen</font>

884
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,750
some debt covenants actually require

885
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,330
companies to have two years worth of

886
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:19,550
revenue coverage you know because the

887
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,470
banks want to get paid back and you know

888
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:23,870
if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got two years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get back on</font>

889
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:26,120
your feet<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the banks are more</font>

890
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:29,990
likely going to get paid the other

891
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:32,330
gotcha here is if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> insurance policy</font>

892
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:34,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">says it covers fines and penalties fines</font>

893
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:37,279
are technically from the government so

894
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:41,450
PCI is not government so you need a

895
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,590
separate policy to cover that you know

896
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,359
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not trying to sell you the</font>

897
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:45,560
hole in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> donut they're trying to make</font>

898
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that you don't get too much</font>

899
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,620
insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's so much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there that</font>

900
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:53,629
you probably need all of it so an you

901
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,160
know trigger is

902
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,140
wrongful acts so someone slips and

903
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,720
breaks their leg you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you're going</font>

904
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:03,589
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be paying for that security and</font>

905
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:06,649
privacy policies you know the trigger

906
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:08,390
event is a security failure or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a privacy</font>

907
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,890
event and if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the fine</font>

908
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:13,069
print more likely it says it's a

909
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,509
legislative only event so you can you

910
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:17,538
see a lot of companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there who</font>

911
00:39:14,509 --> 00:39:19,759
will do a breach notification saying

912
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:21,680
well we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data was</font>

913
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:23,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">stolen or we don't believe the data was</font>

914
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,359
stolen insurance won't cover that unless

915
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,259
you buy the extra coverage because

916
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:33,049
that's what's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a voluntary</font>

917
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:36,289
notification and<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless the law says</font>

918
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:37,819
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it you really have</font>

919
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:39,799
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of pocket unless you</font>

920
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:41,720
bought that extra insurance so another

921
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:43,880
reason why companies don't actually do

922
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,140
the notification is they're probably

923
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,890
sitting around with their attorneys

924
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,720
saying yeah we technically haven't

925
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:53,000
triggered the breach notification

926
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,000
statute so let's not not preemptively

927
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,680
send any emails or anything like that

928
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,559
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can add on a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

929
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">to your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> insurance policy as well such as</font>

930
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,759
punitive damages top your insurance

931
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:07,579
attorneys about this one because<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

932
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:09,769
states such as New York will prohibit

933
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:13,339
insurance from paying punitive damages

934
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:15,828
only compensatory damages so certain

935
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:18,470
jurisdictions your insurance may not

936
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:20,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">help you so why pay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it unless you're</font>

937
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:23,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually going to get coverage and then</font>

938
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:24,529
also if you do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of those</font>

939
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:28,069
jurisdictions you may want to talk to

940
00:40:24,529 --> 00:40:31,099
your CFO about setting money aside for

941
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:33,288
lawsuits and other things you know we

942
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:34,970
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Wall Street banks set</font>

943
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:38,450
aside money to cover lawsuits from the

944
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:41,180
whole housing crash we'll probably see

945
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:44,149
companies setting aside money to pay

946
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:47,180
damages for cyber incidents as well you

947
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:49,609
just reserve that balance sheet and you

948
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:51,950
know hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to it another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

949
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:53,509
area of insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to be</font>

950
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,808
controversial to a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

951
00:40:53,509 --> 00:40:58,339
room

952
00:40:53,809 --> 00:41:00,979
cyber extortion insurance so you get you

953
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:04,189
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some locker where that encrypts all</font>

954
00:41:00,979 --> 00:41:05,959
your files or someone breaks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> doc's as</font>

955
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:09,410
you and says hey we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put this</font>

956
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:11,390
stuff out here well you can buy

957
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:13,160
additional coverage to cover paying them

958
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:15,170
off now we hear that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you should</font>

959
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">never pay a ransom in the insurance</font>

960
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:20,150
world paying ransoms is kind of a common

961
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:23,329
thing you know some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my previous</font>

962
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:25,969
clients from years ago had kidnap and

963
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:28,670
ransom insurance for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the</font>

964
00:41:25,969 --> 00:41:30,140
executives so you know they're traveling

965
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,150
a foreign country they get kidnapped

966
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,709
ransom gets posted insurance company

967
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:36,279
will pay however many millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

968
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:39,618
dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> of coverage the company has a</font>

969
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:42,650
different client had mercenary and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

970
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:44,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">rescued insurance so they would actually</font>

971
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:48,789
cover the cost of hiring mercenaries to

972
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:51,828
go state your rescue if the you know

973
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:53,180
ransom was turned down so really you

974
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:54,979
know you got insurance out there some

975
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,359
guys in balaclava<font color="#E5E5E5"> some rifles in but</font>

976
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:58,069
eventually we're going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

977
00:41:56,359 --> 00:42:00,170
point where you got guys with these and

978
00:41:58,069 --> 00:42:04,038
laptops you know trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your get</font>

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:06,650
your data back<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you know in</font>

980
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:09,859
a few minutes we have left we're going

981
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:12,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do a hypothetical exercise you guys</font>

982
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:14,989
probably be horrified and amused by this

983
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:17,479
one you know so we're going to be

984
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:21,410
consultants who are working for activist

985
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:24,919
investors to secure data and protect the

986
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:26,928
company's assets so this is the scenario

987
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,239
you're a compliance consultant for an

988
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:31,969
activist investment firm a new campaign

989

has replaced<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board and c-suite the</font>

00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:35,390
target company will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be transformed into</font>

991
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:37,640
an investment holdings company and

992
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,469
operations will be spun out target

993
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,598
company has recently completed an

994
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:43,729
acquisition but is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not completed a</font>

1025
00:44:02,779 --> 00:44:06,170

1026
00:44:04,939 --> 00:44:08,299
have you find out what your legal and

1027

contractual requirements are number<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1028
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:12,288
it opens you up to government contracts

1029
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,329
which causes you actually spend less

competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah because it's doing you</font>

1063
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,109
no good if it's just sitting there and

you're not collecting royalties from it

1065
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:35,609
you know legals also gonna incorporate

1066
00:45:33,449 --> 00:45:38,219
new subsidiaries and you know they're

1067

take a look and say okay yeah that even

1073
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,629
though it ticks the box it does look

1074
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:56,129
kind of negligent or hokey so you know

1075
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:57,509
we may or may not support that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1076
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:01,349
finance you know you're going to ensure

your assets that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the auditors</font>

1078
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:06,299
have surfaced and the other important

1079
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:07,769
apartment that's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in</font>

1080
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:11,190
one of these exercises<font color="#E5E5E5"> is your tax</font>

1081
00:46:07,769 --> 00:46:13,348
department because trademarks patents

1082
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:16,049
and copyrights are taxed differently in

1083
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:20,699
different countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1084
00:46:16,049 --> 00:46:24,180
have a local company you may and I

1085
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:26,369
apologize for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one you may have a</font>

1086
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,348
reason to put some of the stuff offshore

1087
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:30,839
which is why you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to some</font>

1088
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:32,219
licensed accountants yeah subsidiary

1089
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:34,078
companies are very important this is

1090
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:35,969
pulled from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tiffany and companies 10k</font>

1091
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,769
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to do anything this</font>

1092
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:39,749
complex where companies owned companies

1093
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:44,459
who owned companies for this exercise

1094
00:46:39,749 --> 00:46:47,519
but you know in any type of company<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1095
00:46:44,459 --> 00:46:49,229
can really restructure like this so the

1096
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,578
headquarters becomes the holding company

1097
00:46:49,229 --> 00:46:53,979
the important thing

1098
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:55,809
this situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know that the</font>

1099
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:58,089
holdings company doesn't produce any

1100
00:46:55,809 --> 00:46:59,619
goods or services so one of the

1101
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:02,469
subsidiaries is going to be the

1102
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:03,729
operating company and you know we're

1103
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:05,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have a real estate company a</font>

1104
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:08,739
staffing company<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put my leasing and</font>

1105
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:10,869
IP you can stack your different business

1106
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:14,709
lines and separate legal entities as

1107
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:17,380
well you know some of the important

1108
00:47:14,709 --> 00:47:20,680
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this is defense against</font>

1109
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:23,559
contagion<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right and yeah we're</font>

1110
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,328
talking financial contagion not computer

1111
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:27,640
viruses but each legal entity is

1112
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:29,650
self-contained so the customers have a

1113
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,868
contract with that one company they can

1114
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,170
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> sue that one company provided your</font>

1115
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:37,450
attorneys have set it up properly so

1116
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:40,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">they have separate accounting books and</font>

1117
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:42,249
bank accounts so the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> money at risk</font>

1118
00:47:40,209 --> 00:47:45,069
is what's in that bank account for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1119
00:47:42,249 --> 00:47:46,450
one company and what a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies</font>

1120
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:48,489
do holding companies do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they'll</font>

1121
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:53,288
charge management fees down into the

1122
00:47:48,489 --> 00:47:54,789
subsidiaries and you know they will move

1123
00:47:53,289 --> 00:47:56,349
that money out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those bank account so</font>

1124
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:59,140
by the time we file your lawsuit there

1125
00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:01,619
may not be any money<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1126
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:04,118
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you protect the company</font>

1127
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:06,609
against the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing intellectual</font>

1132
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:21,009
because you know companies license put
