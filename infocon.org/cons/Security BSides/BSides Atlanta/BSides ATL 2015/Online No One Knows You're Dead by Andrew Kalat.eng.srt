want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today and so a couple</font>

17
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:07,150
of upbeats there will be no cyber in

18
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:10,120
this talk whatsoever no summer aside

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:16,060
from that disclaimer that we know more

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:20,340
see words all right warning this is not

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:23,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">a fun talk this is a difficult topic</font>

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,580
there will be difficult pictures there

23
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,180
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult things to talk about</font>

24
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:31,329
here but it's important we will try to

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,130
keep it light we will try to not stay in

26
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:36,130
a bad place at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this talk but</font>

27
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:39,880
I have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a journey the</font>

28
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:42,219
point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you don't empathize and</font>

29
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,310
sympathize with this topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I have</font>

30
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:47,079
to tell you won't resonate so I'm

31
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,689
intentionally going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mess with your</font>

32
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:53,939
emotions I apologize in advance but it's

33
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:55,658
important so I don't think I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

34
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,898
apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got some feedback over</font>

35
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:01,570
here I worked with Michaels Widow Beth

36
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:04,600
and she gave her full support and input

37
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:07,178
on this talk so in no way am I trying to

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,669
do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> other than honor Michael and</font>

39
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:11,920
his life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also share important</font>

40
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,049
information and i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have done</font>

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,130
this or approaches without Beth's

to hospital the problem was nobody knew

110
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,919
what happened and here's an interesting

111
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:36,090
point one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the first points that kind</font>

112
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:40,169
of matters for us we rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on these</font>

113
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,989
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys to contact everybody and to</font>

115
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,120
of what I imagined happen emotions is is

116
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:50,789
Beth when removed from the vehicle lost

117
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,379
all of her stuff even if any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

145
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,099
Texas she was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically tell</font>

146
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:09,378
them about a website<font color="#CCCCCC"> that her brother</font>

147
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:11,438
head up and running<font color="#E5E5E5"> it had a phone</font>

148
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:14,020
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it and this is not a Sunday</font>

149
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:17,180
they called this phone number<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

150
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:20,109
fortunately her sister-in-law was there

151
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:23,690
and that's how she started

152
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,550
but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> was she didn't have any</font>

153
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">other contact info so what's Gil got to</font>

154
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:31,820
the hospital he brought with her with

155
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:34,969
him another iPad and here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another good</font>

156
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:37,250
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology she was able to</font>

157
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">get online and look through her contacts</font>

158
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,390
online and then start reaching out to

159
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,910
friends and family but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again without</font>

160
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,200
this technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean when I was a kid</font>

161
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,540
we had memorized everybody's phone

162
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:53,090
number nowadays we don't memorize<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of</font>

163
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:55,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">them so it's an interesting concept so</font>

164
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,469
meanwhile<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in Texas they leave here</font>

165
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,420
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key point they're</font>

166
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,180
traveling they're visiting the issue the

167
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,800
cars<font color="#CCCCCC"> in parking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flyer so one of the</font>

168
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,470
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> things they needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do let's get</font>

169
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,350
the car on a parking flyer this is

170
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,850
actually something I helped with i

171
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,380
started calling park and fly called

172
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:16,600
their local office called the regional

173
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:19,700
office they didn't know what to do and

174
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,610
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be a common theme very</font>

175
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,930
few companies have a process<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a</font>

176
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,950
procedure to deal with these incidents

177
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:31,790
in ought to do and so like most customer

178
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:35,598
service reps they blow me off what

179
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,789
finally worked was tweeting out hey park

180
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,550
and fly social media accounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm trying</font>

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:44,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">to retrieve my dead friend's car will</font>

182
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:47,750
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call me i got a call</font>

183
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,310
within a couple of hours and they

184
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,020
happily work with me to get the car now

185
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,329
good on<font color="#CCCCCC"> them they actually didn't charge</font>

186
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,420
all for a nice day and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

187
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,710
good once i got their attention but one

188
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,660
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i found through this process</font>

189
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:03,260
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies don't have a</font>

190
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:06,140
procedure or process for this and one

191
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,160
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found as well as that we'll</font>

192
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this from a social</font>

193
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,079
engineering aspect in a bit there's a

194
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,120
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of confusion when these things</font>

195
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,660
happen I know everybody's bummed out

196
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,660
right now I'm sorry

197
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,239
so let's talk about Michaels IT

198
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,980
footprint and he was the fundamental

199
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,260
problem and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Beth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

200
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,620
brilliant that she is she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an IT</font>

201
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:29,720
person Michael was an uber IT person

202
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,780
you're going to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> some pictures of his</font>

203
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,360
gear in a minute and because it's his

204
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:39,350
hobby like most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in here he handled</font>

205
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,900
all of the IT for their family now

206
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,560
here's the problem i put Beth a severe

207
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:48,740
disadvantage in terms of dealing with

208
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">this problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after Michael something was</font>

209
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,030
gone we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the</font>

210
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,350
recommendation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give an idea you</font>

211
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,819
know Michael<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had just about</font>

212
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,360
everything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could think of from an IT</font>

213
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,430
footprint gmail he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> over 10 personal</font>

214
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,860
domain setup that he was hosting yet

215
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:07,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">colocation servers going he had a bunch</font>

216
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,350
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff going at his own house he had</font>

217
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,329
everything Apple ever made set up and

218
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,740
running in his house I'm pretty sure

219
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,370
half of the stock price of Apple's

220
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:19,460
because of Michael and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was doing side</font>

221
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,230
businesses and you know I was one of

222
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,960
Michael's closest friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font>

223
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,790
know half the stuff he had going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so</font>

224
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,640
this top really is about how do we

225
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:31,219
figure this stuff out and more

226
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,610
importantly I think how do we help our

227
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:40,420
loved ones deal with this unfortunate

228
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:44,240
circumstance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of arabinose so to start to</font>

229
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:47,959
untangle this once Beth was recovered

230
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,600
and came back from Texas you're trying

231
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what to do and how to get</font>

232
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,440
her back online and this was as

233
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,599
fundamental as she didn't even

234
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,310
necessarily have access to the Wi-Fi I

235
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,980
mean unless she had a pre-configured

236
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,900
device but she lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of her devices</font>

237
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,520
sure she's got new devices she didn't

238
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi password that's no fault</font>

239
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,189
on her but I'm sure a lot of you folks

240
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,599
in here if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a partner and</font>

241
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:15,020
they're not an attack you probably set

242
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,250
on this up you know so this isn't this

243
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,740
isn't uncommon

244
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,560
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> went so amazing as she had a</font>

245
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,660
neighbor nearby come over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reset</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

246
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,609
laughs back to default so she could at

247
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,610
least get back online at the house

248
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:35,310
fortunately as well Michael unlike a lot

249
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:40,650
of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> today kept paper records of</font>

250
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:42,540
his bills if he hadn't done that it

251
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,550
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult for Beth</font>

252
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,250
and others to figure out what Michael

253
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:50,459
was up to because we traced a lot of

254
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,930
this back through credit card bills but

255
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,040
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us do online billing today and</font>

256
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:59,069
online receipts and all that sort of

257
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,990
stuff so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult to find</font>

258
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:04,080
this stuff because<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind most all</font>

259
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,790
this is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your email and so we're</font>

260
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about how difficult it was</font>

261
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:11,099
to get back an email especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's</font>

262
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,900
if it's google google is incredibly

263
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,380
difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back into so we're</font>

264
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:20,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about that the other</font>

265
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:22,830
upside of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Beth was on most</font>

266
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,260
of the accounts and Michael did make

267
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,240
sure make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that but like most</font>

268
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,920
couples they split duties in their

269
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,020
household they had different areas of

270
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">strengths weaknesses and you know this</font>

271
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,780
has nothing to do with gender roles it

272
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,690
has to do with Michael did all the IT

273
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,550
stuff because that was his gig but a put

274
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,820
Beth in a bond in the series

275
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:44,579
circumstance Michael also<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a bunch of</font>

276
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,280
boxes at accola I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosting a bunch of</font>

277
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:51,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff and we weren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even sure what's</font>

278
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:54,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer so first of all keep in mind</font>

279
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,300
that kolos prohibit access to people who

280
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,740
aren't authorized so the first thing we

281
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,430
had to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> was have Beth reach out to</font>

282
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,920
them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hi this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is weird but my</font>

283
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">husband</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just died</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and he's got a bunch</font>

284
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">of boxes there we got to come figure out</font>

285
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,610
what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and like many of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

286
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,020
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we encountered they had no</font>

287
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,050
process or procedure for this or knew

288
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,930
what to do the upside is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

289
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:22,319
Beth which is up

290
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:26,099
and she got me authorized as a person<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

291
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,990
come visit<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and I the cold weather is</font>

292
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,810
cooler blocks I do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank them</font>

293
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,070
publicly because they did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great job</font>

294
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:35,040
and helping us figure this out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave</font>

295
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:39,060
us all the help<font color="#E5E5E5"> he needed their up just</font>

296
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,290
off of cobb parkway<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's spring if you</font>

297
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,410
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a column in that</font>

298
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:47,520
area so what we found was Michael had

299
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:49,980
five boxes of the right of Nicola and

300
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,959
that's pretty much all I knew going in

301
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:58,500
and because i'm lazy or efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> i took</font>

302
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,160
pictures right and this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front</font>

303
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,660
this is the back lot of stuff going on

304
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,430
now for all uit folks you're looking

305
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:09,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's going yeah no big deal but</font>

306
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:12,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">imagine if you don't know I tea and you</font>

307
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,370
walked<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this and you're like I have</font>

308
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:18,240
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what this is or where to even</font>

309
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,740
start fortunately you know that's new to

310
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,750
reach out to some people like myself who

311
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,150
could help but imagine if your partner

312
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:28,709
couldn't there are things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do to</font>

313
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">help them so again being lazy I started</font>

314
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,650
figuring out okay what's on these so we

315
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,140
grabbed<font color="#CCCCCC"> a crash cart fortunate all these</font>

316
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:36,470
guys at vga plugged it in started

317
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,089
getting a screen up to see what they are

318
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">we knew we had five boxes mean you had</font>

319
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:44,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten active IPS found out he had three es</font>

320
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:47,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">xboxes to linux boxes all different</font>

321
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,510
versions because<font color="#CCCCCC"> why standardized</font>

322
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:57,460
yeah hey that was you not me so again

323
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,770
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm lazy I just pictures but</font>

324
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,570
when I start capturing was what versions

325
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,069
what flavor is what were these things

326
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,560
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of your thinking well</font>

327
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,080
this isn't so bad we can create mood<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDs</font>

328
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,599
and reset<font color="#E5E5E5"> root right all right and that</font>

329
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:17,110
was a great idea until we hit a little

330
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">point later that didn't go so various</font>

331
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,690
different flavors you know here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> es x3</font>

332
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">i-35 Bible a one of these I can't</font>

333
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember which one them here we got</font>

334
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:30,940
again 35 here we've got centos-5 one

335
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,130
here we've got esxi 50 so we were all

336
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:37,480
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the map on what versions he had</font>

337
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:38,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">running here much less what was Amon so</font>

338
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,640
once I took all that back i made the the

339
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:44,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">boot USBS and boot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cds and had to do a</font>

340
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,760
cold boot on these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

341
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:49,510
dangerous but what else I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to do</font>

342
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,510
to reset room so I could get in to see

343
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:56,439
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on one of these by the</font>

344
00:15:52,510 --> 00:16:01,689
way sxi 50 they decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be more</font>

345
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:03,160
secure and said nope sorry you can't do

346
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:10,420
that officially the only official ways

347
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:12,130
to reinstall the the host OS there are

348
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,530
some unofficial ways to capaces you can

349
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,850
google for them which which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did but</font>

350
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:18,100
it's you know could break stuffing is

351
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,140
dangerous but most these were easy and

352
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,300
when I got into found this I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

353
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:25,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">he had a bunch of different gastos</font>

354
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,949
running because<font color="#CCCCCC"> Y combined functionality</font>

355
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,140
when I can put it on multiple guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

356
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,030
so we had one else it was just DNS that

357
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,580
one host that was just email we had one

358
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,760
host that was just patchy and then a

359
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,520
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> different web servers spread out</font>

360
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">start figuring out what was out there</font>

361
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,660
what we found as well and this was a

362
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,400
huge fine was he figured out where he

363
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,410
had registered his domains unfortunately

364
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,380
for us he had registered all them in one

365
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,300
location if he had spread them out this

366
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,939
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been really hard and Beth</font>

367
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,800
discovered this from a credit card bill

368
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,250
now again keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this might only</font>

369
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">bill once per year</font>

370
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,809
so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meantime we're lost</font>

371
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:08,379
fortunately paper cup record found it

372
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:09,699
knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could get into it the other</font>

373
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,949
interesting thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll mention now</font>

374
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:13,300
is that most of the time credit card

375
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:16,270
statements don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the full credit</font>

376
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,470
card number and most of the time when

377
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're calling these services they want</font>

378
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,630
the full credit card numbers as a

379
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,319
verification of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> account we didn't</font>

380
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:29,230
have that but what I'll tell you is when

381
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:33,159
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> play me my husband just died card it</font>

382
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:35,920
helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people will usually bend the</font>

383
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:39,010
rules for so for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain registrar</font>

384
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">beth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called first and was able to reset</font>

385
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,450
the password to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we knew i was</font>

386
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,590
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in and found all these ten</font>

387
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,420
domains that he end up and running and

388
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,240
was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> map them back to what was</font>

389
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,460
going out at the colo it figure out what

390
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,690
was important that we had to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

391
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,250
and we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a couple things been</font>

392
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brother's business i mentioned</font>

393
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,800
earlier their website that was being

394
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:01,000
hosted here and his<font color="#E5E5E5"> email Beth had a</font>

395
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,850
personal domain that was hosted at

396
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,140
that's this as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so to Michael but</font>

397
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,850
along with a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other stuff we</font>

398
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,650
actually found some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

399
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,629
hosting stuff there that we had to

400
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:13,030
contact and get them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come get their</font>

401
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,400
stuff basically and take their boxes and

402
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,050
shift their hosting to someplace else

403
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,320
that was an interesting an awkward

404
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,320
conversation

405
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,860
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a huge file so if you can</font>

406
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,970
try to use one registrar because it

407
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,969
makes life easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those of us trying</font>

408
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:33,549
to clean<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the mess what we were able</font>

409
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is then figure out what we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

410
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:40,299
shift we took bets email off the server

411
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">on to its own domain we took the</font>

412
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:44,620
brothers business from one of their

413
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:47,379
family members rebuild the website

414
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,330
someplace else we reported DNS to

415
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,250
another web hosting provider pulled

416
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,379
email off put it pointed someplace else

417
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:56,440
reason for all this by the way one thing

418
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:59,679
I forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you guys is all this</font>

419
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,130
was expensive and in a situation like

420
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we were trying to stop the bleeding</font>

421
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,639
so there was a sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> urgency of</font>

422
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:10,689
getting this stuff shut down to get

423
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:12,219
these bills to stop right as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

424
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,740
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just getting control over all this</font>

425
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,169
stuff so this was probably about a month

426
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,289
long process to go let's figure it out

427
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:22,510
shift it around and moved around and

428
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:25,149
then once we've moved everything we knew

429
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:29,529
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> turned it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off and</font>

430
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:31,779
see what was going to yell fortunately

431
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:34,419
nothing did so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we found and</font>

432
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:35,950
located everything but the whole

433
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:38,820
infrastructure was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

434
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,820
story yeah you got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

435
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:51,450
yeah it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I talked to</font>

436
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> colo about that it was interesting</font>

437
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:56,070
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> secolo and the question was did we</font>

438
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:57,870
have the capability of doing passive

439
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,139
monitoring on the colo infrastructure

440
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,289
the figure out what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on there</font>

441
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:06,690
the short answer is the colo did not

442
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:09,270
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gone through an</font>

443
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,830
acquisition and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

444
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,240
monitoring stuff set back up because we

445
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,860
said i<font color="#CCCCCC"> SAT with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a cuddle guy and I'm</font>

446
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,450
like great you've got I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

447
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,289
what the what the two was it's good to

448
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,200
take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it because that was the</font>

449
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:21,030
exact idea man and we pounded on for an

450
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,700
hour and couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any any data back</font>

451
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,320
so yeah that would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> made perfect</font>

452
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,929
sense but we just couldn't couldn't get

453
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,820
it to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at that point I had already</font>

454
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:31,140
got enough other progress elsewhere that

455
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,039
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of brute forced it but that</font>

456
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:38,549
is a great idea so the home

457
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:43,230
infrastructure was a bigger mess Michael

458
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:44,820
was a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an IT hoarder in</font>

459
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:49,230
fact I'm pretty sure we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start a</font>

460
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:51,240
museum with what's in his basement the

461
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:55,770
heat load from his basement was visible

462
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,679
on satellites in fact we siphon<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heat</font>

463
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:01,080
off to feed one of the power plants and

464
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:06,809
here's the problem we have no idea what

465
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:09,149
any of it did so again I want you to

466
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:14,940
look at these next pictures and forget

467
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:17,760
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i.t this is just</font>

468
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shells of beer Mike out</font>

469
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,030
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> around we can all look at that</font>

470
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,030
know what that is pretend you don't

471
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:40,820
this is about ten percent think about

472
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:50,090
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> you walk into your basement you're</font>

473
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:54,800
like ah Andy yeah sounds like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a proper</font>

474
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:56,030
tomorrow right but you know in the

475
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,430
situation like that you just want some

476
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:04,730
sense of normalcy back you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so i</font>

477
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:07,100
will tell you we're still figuring this

478
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:10,400
stuff out this talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not all about</font>

479
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:15,290
wins we had some fails we'll talk about

480
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,510
the fails so part of the problem that we

481
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:21,260
ran into here is that we didn't know

482
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:24,170
where any of the stuff was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you care</font>

483
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:27,920
about a situation like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this Michael was</font>

484
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:31,310
a huge avid photographer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went on one</font>

485
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,800
trip with him he took over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2800 pictures</font>

486
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:37,399
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that trip buddy we were in the</font>

487
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,540
National Park<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what you do we</font>

488
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,150
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know where those pictures</font>

489
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:44,389
are it could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been on one of these</font>

490
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:45,890
servers we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure and we're not</font>

491
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,910
we're not done yet but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

492
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about that but at one point after</font>

493
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,810
we knew we had figured out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

494
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,139
infrastructure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary for</font>

495
00:22:53,810 --> 00:23:01,399
functioning we just said turn it

496
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:02,720
off see what happens we didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

497
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,700
was interconnected with what we didn't

498
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what talk to what at the colo we'd</font>

499
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:11,000
already had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the colo shutdown so that's</font>

500
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:13,070
what we did and at least to you know

501
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,520
stop the heat load and turn off all the

502
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,800
electrical draw and figure out where we

503
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,240
were the easiest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to do was terror</font>

504
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,620
back down the minimums and build<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back</font>

505
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:28,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's that's what we did</font>

506
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:31,168
Michael also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one more picture</font>

507
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:34,649
I got a lot of max he was a big apple

508
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:39,179
fan<font color="#CCCCCC"> an apples really really security set</font>

509
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:40,860
it up that way really secure which is

510
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,049
great if you want to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

511
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,709
stealing your gear breaking in really

512
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:49,710
sucks when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm trying to do</font>

513
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:51,120
so Michael had a macbook pro had a mac

514
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,059
mini and a bunch of the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and like</font>

515
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,178
no problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll just create the OSX</font>

516
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:58,649
install<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk on USB we'll have some</font>

517
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,270
dinner<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll be into these in 10 minutes</font>

518
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have a nice little time drink</font>

519
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:05,850

good day so a girlfriend and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i head</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

up to Beth's house and they start<font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

522
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,450
dinner I pull up my<font color="#E5E5E5"> little handy dandy</font>

523
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:16,020
hacking USB key thinking I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

524
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:19,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">hero and I boot up off it I go to reset</font>

525
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,580
the root password and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes nope you</font>

526
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:27,090
mean no found out it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

527
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:30,539
look at it a little more can't melt the

528
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:33,918
hard drive that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird Oh Michael set</font>

529
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:36,990
up full disk encryption that's lovely

530
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,970
all right anybody got an idea what

531
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,649
password is ya<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is Michael it</font>

532
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:44,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">was probably a thirty-eight thousand</font>

533
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:46,739
character password yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> he has a serious</font>

534
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:48,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">ax</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried stuff like</font>

535
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,700
that may be seen when did he pass word

536
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:57,149
just for giggles okay that sucks however

537
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:58,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mac offers a recovery key option it</font>

538
00:24:57,149 --> 00:25:00,809
looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> an activation key Fleck</font>

539
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,408
windows it's a 16 digit or 12 digit

540
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:06,629
character recovery key great let's see

541
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:09,779
if we can find one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those couldn't</font>

542
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:15,059
however you can store the recovery key

543
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:17,010
at apple com excellent we know that it

544
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:19,830
figured out that Michael had used one of

545
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:23,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">his own domains as his specific domain</font>

546
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:25,918
for registering apple com I'm like sweet

547
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:28,289
i'll spin that baby back up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll go</font>

548
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,059
do a restore at apple com and<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

549
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:34,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">password i'm in and see if he's got his</font>

550
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:34,220
recovery key there yeah

551
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:41,940
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple's really secure so Apple</font>

552
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:44,790
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not recognize any right of</font>

553
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,410
survivorship which by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this is</font>

554
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">variant for all these different cod</font>

555
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:53,070
domains in services album pretty much

556
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,380
says we don't care sorry this is the way

557
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,909
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we it's not going to work so we</font>

558
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,760
figured out<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was using my security</font>

partner calm as his email and got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

574
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:51,510
it was an epic<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail and this is still</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ongoing by the way we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

a sad Widow card yes Phil well you know

579
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:06,660
I did I did and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> a van showed up</font>

580
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:12,540
outside my house and they weren't

581
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:15,300
helpful but I sent them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pizza so this</font>

582
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:18,450
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a lot of other sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of online</font>

00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">services and how they work and what</font>

584
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,170
their policies are and what I found

585
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,050
throughout this process and doing

586
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:27,690
research for this talk many different

587
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:30,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">online services have highly varied</font>

588
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:33,480
policies when it goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for</font>

589
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,040
instance Google and this is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> of text but it's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a picture</font>

591
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,409
of a wall of text so that's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

592
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:42,360
breaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rule they basically say hey</font>

593
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:47,160
you know we recognize that

594
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:49,080
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what to do you can</font>

595
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,910
come and ask for information about

596
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,679
somebody's account and here's the

597
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:54,180
various things you can do by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you</font>

598
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,710
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a death certificate and all this</font>

599
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,380
other stuff and an ounce of blood in

600
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:01,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">your firstborn and fill out a form and</font>

601
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,780
we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to you we filled out that</font>

602
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:07,590
form two months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago we have not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard</font>

603
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:09,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">from google so do not count on this</font>

604
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,370
working for you in a timely manner and

605
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,470
ultimately when they probably would do

606
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,090
is send you a DVD with some specific

607
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:16,370
information you requested they're not

608
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,270
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you access to the account</font>

609
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,860
they're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the password</font>

610
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,290
of something you know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that</font>

611
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,850
explicitly well they also say by the way

612
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:26,970
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interesting counterpoint to</font>

613
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:28,169
Microsoft if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to know the</font>

614
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,580
password of the account you're not

615
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:33,270
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it that's against our</font>

616
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:35,040
policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft on the other hand</font>

617
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,330
says hey if you know the password to the

618
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,290
account and your next<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Kim rock out</font>

619
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:43,020
have a nice day so interesting

620
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:43,800
comparison there<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google does have</font>

621
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">something interesting called the</font>

622
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,530
inactive Account Manager which is kind

623
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,350
of some<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting voodoo the concept</font>

624
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:56,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it is after a certain period of</font>

625
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:58,919
inactivity you can trigger somebody to

626
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,440
suddenly get access to your account or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

627
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,600
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> data of your account or just</font>

628
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,550
being sent that email<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hey I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

629
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,189
fell<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the planet you should check on</font>

630
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:10,680
me and it's kind of odd because they

631
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,690
don't exactly tell you how they do it

632
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,700
you know how do they detect the lack of

633
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,080
activity they say we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at several</font>

634
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:20,040
signals to understand whether you're

635
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:23,399
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> using new accounts and if you</font>

636
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,440
don't after some random period of time

637
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,380
they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually send to somebody you</font>

638
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,600
designate access to your stuff so

639
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,900
something to think about if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

640
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:38,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of stuff on Google Facebook actually</font>

641
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:40,170
has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most robust death policy they</font>

642
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,580
have a couple different things so first

643
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:46,140
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> these memorialized accounts</font>

644
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:47,490
which is kind of interesting i will tell

645
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,170
you

646
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,550
the older I get and this is an obvious

647
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:53,490
statement but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the older I get the more</font>

648
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:56,389
people I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know die and it's really odd</font>

649
00:29:53,490 --> 00:30:01,140
now running across their accounts online

650
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:02,940
after they're dead so what facebook said

651
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,850
is hey we know that this is sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

652
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">online centralized gathering place so we</font>

653
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:10,500
want to spin up this concept of the

654
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:15,059
moralizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> americans so it's sort of a</font>

655
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:17,460
virtual online morning site you know so

656
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:19,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know you can you can post</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things on</font>

657
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,670
these on these you can share them people

658
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,720
can view them but it doesn't appear and

659
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,880
recommend a<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend's it doesn't appear</font>

660
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">on birthdays doesn't parent ads doesn't</font>

661
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,190
appear in<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like</font>

662
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're active and no one can actually</font>

663
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,490
log<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the Kathy count itself is not</font>

664
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,929
actually a real account anymore it's

665
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,640
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like a placeholder for their</font>

666
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:38,179
account anything they shared stays

667
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,910
visible there's no password though and

668
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:43,830
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that basically Facebook has a form</font>

669
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:46,559
and again now this is automated this all

670
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes to people have to review it so it's</font>

671
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,540
a slow process the other option is if

672
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Kim you can ask them to</font>

673
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:57,450
just delete the account immediately so

674
00:30:54,510 --> 00:31:00,059
what am I takeaways for you guys is you

675
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,830
may want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your next of</font>

676
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,899
kin what you want to happen to your

677
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">online stuff after you die I know it</font>

678
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">sounds kind of morbid but would you want</font>

679
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,650
to still<font color="#CCCCCC"> be running around online</font>

680
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:13,770
efforts that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to the</font>

681
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:17,580
side there a third option which is this

682
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:19,379
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the legacy contact and basically</font>

683
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,770
it's allow you to say hey this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my</font>

684
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:26,220
next of kin when it comes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my facebook</font>

685
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:28,020
account and you can also set and

686
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,870
designate hey this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the person who</font>

687
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,340
gets to run this and oh by the way the

688
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,649
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I wanted to do is clean up</font>

689
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,000
and delete my<font color="#CCCCCC"> account if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want so</font>

690
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:40,110
Facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually is a pretty robust</font>

691
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,059
policy on this Twitter apparently wants

692
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:43,649
you to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know get into a mortgage with</font>

693
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:45,389
them

694
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:47,730
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything they want to know about</font>

695
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:51,000
us and your only option with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

696
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:53,600
really is just shut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the account but</font>

697
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,850
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see I won't read all this</font>

698
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,899
it's a pretty lengthy thing and here's

699
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,540
the other thing because Twitter doesn't

700
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,730
have a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> name policy they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opted for a</font>

701
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:05,090
lot to try to prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is who you</font>

702
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,090
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

703
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:12,730
next can process it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft it's</font>

704
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,689
kind of all encapsulated near<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aldo com</font>

705
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,999
it's pretty interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they're</font>

706
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,830
willing to send you a DVD with all their

707
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:20,210
information and again it's not not too

708
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,340
bad you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know the</font>

709
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,690
typical stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again they're not</font>

710
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,519
typically going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grant you online</font>

711
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,769
access without typically going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

712
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,379
you access to the password but they say

713
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:31,820
elsewhere hey if you have the password

714
00:32:30,379 --> 00:32:32,959
just use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing</font>

we're going to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a DVD anyway</font>

716
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,590
again countering that to Google saying

717
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:40,489
don't ever use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it even if you know what</font>

718
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:43,939
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed back well they</font>

719
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,869

00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:49,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">through this talk quicker than I thought</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">some overall lessons large that I have</font>

723
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:55,970
found this is first time a percent of

724
00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:58,879
this talk so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I apologize if you went a</font>

725
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:01,759
little too quick but we really haven't

726
00:32:58,879 --> 00:33:03,830
caught up from a technical aspect on

727
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:07,009
next of kin issues like we have from a

728
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:09,199
physical property aspect and we are

729
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:11,509
certainly growing faster and faster

730
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:16,789
online and doing more and more things

731
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:18,499
and things happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I don't know</font>

732
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:20,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a society have really</font>

733
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:25,039
figured out how to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

event of a sudden sudden death the other

735
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,639
thing that I learned through this

736
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:31,159
process is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you play the</font>

somebody died car especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font>

inherently believe you Beth<font color="#E5E5E5"> got dozens</font>

00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:48,529
rarely<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to show them so if your</font>

social engineer be nice don't use this

743
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:55,749
it's beyond the pale unless you really

744
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:55,749
really have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then don't blame me</font>

745
00:33:55,899 --> 00:34:01,699
very few companies unless you want to

746
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:04,189
online club<font color="#E5E5E5"> over providers have a policy</font>

747
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,749
on this it's interesting they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

748
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,549
used to this concept of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer</font>

749
00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:10,699
suddenly died and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

750
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:14,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do so it becomes a very personal</font>

751
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:16,939
process to work with those companies and

752
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,030
get somebody on their side to understand

753
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,760
the situation

754
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:22,740
and give a damn enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you most</font>

755
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,200
of them will but it breaks their process

756
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,350
so a call<font color="#E5E5E5"> center person is is their head</font>

757
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,580
will explode they have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> they just</font>

758
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,319
please hold and they never<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

759
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,060
you they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know right it's too</font>

760
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,220
hard for them on eight books an hour to

761
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:40,168
deal with so typically you've got to go

762
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:43,350
up to get philosophical for a second you

763
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:46,799
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally feel that that helping</font>

764
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:50,880
prepare our partners to deal with life

765
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:55,770
after we're gone is a form of love it's

766
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:57,360
how we show them that we care so I have

767
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">some recommendations and here's where I</font>

want to seriously consider using a

password vault or some sort of shared

788
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:02,759
password credentialing system and make

<font color="#E5E5E5">about that a legacy drawer absolutely</font>

794
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:25,510
absolutely the only problem I have with

795
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:28,100
that is I changed my passwords too often

796
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:32,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so I use one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the varying</font>

797
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:34,850
password managers<font color="#E5E5E5"> online and if I can</font>

798
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:37,310
give them the master password to it that

799
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:48,160
I don't change as often in that seal

800
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:48,160
password yes yeah i er Keith great idea

801
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,240
yeah those are good<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here Phil he</font>

802
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,430
recommended an iron key which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

803
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,290
little USB has password vault<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside of</font>

805
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:10,450
have it on you during the crash that's

806
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:10,450
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good it's good discipline</font>

807
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,690
okay so filters brought up a good point

808
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,690
couldn't hear him he had his partner try

809
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:24,920

810
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:26,420
so it's good to test this stuff this is

811
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the normal topic of this talk</font>

like toys but I remember for the things

922

resonate is what he did in the stuff

928
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,440
that he valued and that he was

929
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:15,430
passionate about so you know one thing

930
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,490
