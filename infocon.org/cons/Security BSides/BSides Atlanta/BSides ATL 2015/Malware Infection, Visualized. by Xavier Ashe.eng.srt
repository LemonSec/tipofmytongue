00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,660
come on there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so I'll</font>

2
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:34,120
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could evaluate after a meeting</font>

3
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:35,800
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> would start the afternoon off by</font>

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,599
asking really just kind of gauge the

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,589
audience<font color="#CCCCCC"> of using the right language</font>

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,100
here who here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ratings</font>

7
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:49,030
which is who here actually works as a

8
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:54,540
security analyst and we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

9
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,540
for a company responsible for responding

10
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:05,650
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know researchers</font>

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:08,170
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security field doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bar or vendor I feel like</font>

13
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:17,290
a part of strength we assume the rest of

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,450
you guys are just eaten they had too

15
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:24,540
much hbu tone what was the category got

<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of other places and most recently</font>

22
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:54,380
was at<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit nine so i'll be talking about</font>

23
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">a thing out of here all classes i am now</font>

24
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,929
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer with company I've in between</font>

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,319
gigs right now so I went out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and took</font>

26
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:06,509
this presentation and rather revamped it

27
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,340
to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right let's let's look at all</font>

28
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,869
the tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are out there and see</font>

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,079
what came to build it exists to kind of

30
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,180
do this hopefully this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font>

31
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:16,890
useful to you guys to not only

32
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,700
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of see some oohs and</font>

33
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,910
ahhs turn on some levels but also to

34
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,548
take away and see that there's new

35
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,739
capability now exists out there that you

36
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:30,840
guys can start using the data in

37
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,760
different ways because you know this

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:39,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is someone stuff is like really new</font>

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,920
all right it's not nope try again

40
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:47,030
hi so I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah always gonna start</font>

41
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,250
off with<font color="#E5E5E5"> quotes and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right how</font>

42
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,349
big is the problem so what I'm talking

43
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:55,160
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> here today is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as the</font>

44
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:58,010
response so is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a response is you know</font>

45
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,030
you know something<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad has happened what</font>

46
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,950
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to do about it how do we</font>

47
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:06,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">detect it how can we respond to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> akron</font>

48
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:09,350
remediated and in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> realm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got some</font>

49
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:12,170
couple quotes here so vulnerability is

50
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:14,840
being reached sixty-nine percent of

51
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,600
breaches over the last year were

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,180
discovered externally that's where you

53
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,560
know visa calls you up and says hey

54
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're detecting a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole lot of fraud and</font>

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,390
it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from you so</font>

56
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:29,239
you've been breached FBI coming to you

57
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,069
and saying hey yeah you're sending out a

58
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,709
whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff your breach so</font>

59
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:36,018
seventy percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> no 16 nap says so you</font>

60
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:38,840
are companies the guys who said that I'm

61
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:42,890
here protecting my company we're not

62
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,430
detecting it other people are how long

63
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:51,890
does it take to discover that on average

64
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:53,450
243<font color="#CCCCCC"> days I'm yeah 243 243 days 205 yeah</font>

65
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,548
we think we're getting a year right I

66
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,958
saw that one that said the we are

67
00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:01,760
getting a little bit better but still

68
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:04,130
205 243<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's still months right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

69
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,540
that you're into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we got</font>

70
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">been an average cost on there for the</font>

71
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:13,239
bean counters<font color="#CCCCCC"> as understand that this is</font>

72
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,239
not easy thing to recover<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

73
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so traditional timeline analysis</font>

74
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:23,150
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about anybody in here that</font>

75
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,610
specifically on the IR team that does

76
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,549
instant response malware analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

77
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,430
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands are all right so you pull</font>

78
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:34,130
the image<font color="#E5E5E5"> you or you grab an image you</font>

79
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,870
do a you know collected up rebuild the

80
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,090
timeline we've got this detection we

81
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,070
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's we got this IDs alert</font>

82
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,630
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> this time we're going to go look</font>

83
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,550
to see what was going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> around this</font>

84
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,409
time we're going to pivot on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

85
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,290
look over<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the files that were written</font>

86
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,080
around this time what else we've got you

87
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:53,120
look force through all the PE headers

88
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,130
look at you know what has been

89
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,630
established<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the registry building</font>

90
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,750
that timeline is a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> time-consuming</font>

91
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,040
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> so pulled this off of a great</font>

92
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,340
blog if you guys are working in that

93
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,870
area windows forensic analysis you

94
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically wrote the book literally and</font>

95
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:12,770
has a lot of great tips he also talks

96
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:18,640
about this process mapping capability

97
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll discuss today so links in</font>

98
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:28,610
so we have established fact I mean

99
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:34,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromise happens within seconds right</font>

exfiltration starts happening within

104
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:48,719
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guess that specific download</font>

105
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:51,719
and for specifically for your version of

110
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:05,610
months and once we<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out remediation</font>

111
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,649
takes weeks we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got pull images we got</font>

112
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,550
to look back through firewall logs some

113
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,899
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we heard this morning</font>

114
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">from assume you know if you're not</font>

115
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,550
pulling in all that data you're trying

116
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,990
to recreate something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we might</font>

117
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,990
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data for so there's got</font>

118
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,029
to be a better level and and that

119
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,580
basically a lot of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

120
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:26,339
missing is what are we not collecting at

121
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,779
the time that the attack happened right

122
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,659
what are we collecting right now is

123
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:32,669
generally firewall logs<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids loves things</font>

124
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,469
that on the network we've always said oh

125
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,120
yeah we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a law for</font>

126
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:38,339
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> little packet there goes on</font>

127
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,620
well why can't we create a little long

128
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:43,589
says every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> something execute we log</font>

129
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:47,039
it every time something connects to a

130
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:48,629
endpoint let's log it we've got advanced

131
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">lee powerful pcs that are basically</font>

132
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:54,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing a whole lot of nothing and and</font>

133
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,819
other than downloading lots of movies

134
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:59,069
but that you know you ready oh we've got

135
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:01,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that capability of being able to create</font>

136
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,180
those logs now and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I my</font>

137
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,339
stress through this and show how we can

138
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,800
set that up collect it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also to</font>

139
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:10,830
visualize it so we can understand what

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,879
malware looks like and understand now we

141
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,878
can start using the data

142
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,940
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking about process</font>

143
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,860

156
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,550
well who started that process in what

condition what under user context well

158
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,910
what's the hash of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the file that</font>

159
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,160
actually got<font color="#E5E5E5"> executed what's the file</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">name what are their modules did it load</font>

161
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,760
what's the image name what network

162
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,470
connections is now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not collecting</font>

163
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that type of information so that's what</font>

164
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,060
we're looked into a strong

165
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,749
you

166
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:14,819
get the place in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux where that you</font>

167
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:20,310
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that capability is in the the</font>

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,949
the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> level of modules but it's in</font>

170
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:30,240
the attendance and basically the same

171
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:32,040
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that selinux tapped into is I</font>

172
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,540
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's called just so this blank</font>

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,670
security module in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times on</font>

174
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,790
production systems if customers are not

175
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:42,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">using selinux or skirt they'll actually</font>

176
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,160
take that the colonel build and you know

177
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:49,260
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have those capabilities but</font>

178
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:52,800
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system the windows kernel</font>

179
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:56,130
filter driver was actually create around

180
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,949
XP service pack<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 back when microsoft</font>

181
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,750
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok antivirus companies please stop</font>

182
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,860
hacking our OS to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do the</font>

183
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,480
thing you're going to do will give you

184
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,550
an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> spot to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to slide in here</font>

185
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,810
and it'll be supported and that was the

186
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,399
colonel filter driver same thing with

187
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,469
linux is you have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security</font>

188
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,440
module says<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm allowing something to</font>

189
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:20,550
come in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and shim and i'm gonna do</font>

190
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:22,620
things a very specific way OS<font color="#E5E5E5"> X has also</font>

191
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:26,219
you know you can load in k text

192
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:29,700
libraries but they they have not really

193
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:33,029
officially kind of opened that up<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS X</font>

194
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,770
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apple was still trying to figure out</font>

195
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:37,529
how to work with security vendors and

196
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:40,439
and so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> screwed Rangers still</font>

197
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:42,529
have to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack around OS X</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

198
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,750
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that easy module load</font>

199
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:47,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so so sis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mon collects the</font>

200
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,839
information were to put it it puts it in

201
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:53,520
a Windows Event log so if you you know

202
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,540
we talked about log parser earlier today

203
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,490
that's one way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting at there's a</font>

204
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:04,800
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some python modules out there</font>

205
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:07,230
that can extract out out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the event</font>

206
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,459
log you can now do the bug forwarding

207
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,220
where you can then you know send<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

208
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:15,138
this information to essential site

209
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,399
the other you know log generation tools

210
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:20,790
that could do the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that allows</font>

211
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,370
for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get all those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so bottom</font>

212
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">line is we get a system on too tight a</font>

213
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,149
free download go<font color="#E5E5E5"> download it you can</font>

214
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:29,069
install it with a couple of different

215
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:30,959
options very easy to set up it'll

216
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:33,170
automatically start sending to the event

217
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,439
log and that's what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did to set this up</font>

218
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:40,050
and then just use the log parser and

219
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:43,980
some other Perl and Python scripting to

220
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:46,500
kind of do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some data magic any questions</font>

221
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:55,470
on kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how the lab set up and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

222
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:57,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">get how I get this set up oh sorry I</font>

223
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,050
didn't bullets here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other to make</font>

224
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:03,149
sure we cover these it does collect the

225
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:06,949
full command line it's very similar to

226
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:10,230
if you you know process map<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rock mon or</font>

227
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:12,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">and in the newer task managers that</font>

228
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,100
Microsoft has allows you to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

229
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,469
actual full command line of the image

230
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,809
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was loaded same thing here so for</font>

231
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:23,100
java apps you get to see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual load</font>

232
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:25,559
command and especially when you mouth

233
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,050
most malware loads itself with

234
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:31,860
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> benign Microsoft tools right</font>

235
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:35,939
you'll see you know Reggie Vaughn dll

236
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:37,319
load dll host being used and then you

237
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:39,779
can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the full string to see</font>

238
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:42,149
oh it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually loading this other dll</font>

239
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,040
but is the hash<font color="#E5E5E5"> value has got you know</font>

240
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's Mallinder so there's a lot of</font>

241
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,170
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you do when you get the full</font>

242
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,910
command<font color="#E5E5E5"> line it does record the hash of</font>

243
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">the processes this is really neat</font>

244
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,800
because it actually supports I think

245
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,529
like five or six<font color="#E5E5E5"> different hash types</font>

246
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,959
default sha-1 you can do shop at 256 and

247
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,879
md5 and there was like one or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two others</font>

248
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I've never messed with for all of</font>

249
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:09,420
mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adobe flash set up that is</font>

250
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:12,500
not the real adobe flash said oh and

251
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:17,540
there's some other smile downloaders and

252
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,540
look at all those sub executions

253
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:24,490
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> baby boomer on the</font>

257
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:40,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">and load them up all right so then if</font>

258
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,040
you could if you could take this

259
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,610
immediately you know sends all these

260
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,569
hashes in maybe you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

261
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,750
next-generation firewalls I can do

262
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:53,230
follow where stuff throw these hashes we

263
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:55,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about the security intelligence</font>

264
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:59,500
earlier right feed this into your list

265
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,570
of hashes once you've got a list of bad

266
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,490
hashes then you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

267
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,770
all the network connections idea now

268
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:09,130
I've got even more intelligence I got an

269
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:11,710
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> so did a known cnc I got I got did</font>

270
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:14,770
this then I did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> full map and now I</font>

271
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:17,200
say tell me all the IP IP is that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

272
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:21,699
this connected to I get a list of ips

273
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:26,680
block it done within an hour you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

274
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:30,780
to do an incident report and safe you

275
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,239
know Sally from finance clicked it again

276
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was able to detective but now that we</font>

277
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,670
have this new capability it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

278
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:45,780
me three weeks to do it and we found

279
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:48,240
more intelligence more than our paid for

280
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:50,040
intelligence feeds are<font color="#CCCCCC"> given us because</font>

281
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,510
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got remembered a lot of those paid</font>

282
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,420
for intelligence beads they have a very

283
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,310
specific scope that they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

284
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,930

starts with them that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

286
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:03,300
the state-sponsored threats right and

287
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,430
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a antivirus that are</font>

00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for the type of threats that can</font>

289
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:10,410
be sicker interests and then there's all

290
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,970
the stuff in the middle we're talking

291
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">about finance there was a finance worm</font>

research but they got hit by it and so

296
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:24,210
was able to get this all this held its

297
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,860
information they create this list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

298
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,630
they went to that security intelligence

299
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:31,139
firm I'm sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a million dollars</font>

00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:34,110
to do all the scans and you didn't find

301
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,640
this here's all these IPS that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

302
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">connected here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are all these hashes that</font>

303
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:44,040
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> used by this one variant of</font>

306
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,540
state-sponsored and took them a week to

307
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,159
say it's not you know sorry we didn't

308
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,690
you know here's what we have on it and

309
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,450
eighty percent of us what you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent</font>

310
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">me so this capability really explodes</font>

311
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:04,440
out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of information that you</font>

312
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:06,120
can load in to a security a framework I

313
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,700
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> this quote especially coming after</font>

314
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,949
that last screenshot the user is going

315
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pick dancing pigs over security every</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Schneier well I appreciate you know not</font>

318
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,649
everybody falling asleep during<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and</font>

319
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,190
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> that did I'll come over and smack</font>

320
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:31,440
in the back a little bit later but to

321
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,300
kind of add it all up is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cape</font>

322
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,430
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists both in commercial tools</font>

323
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,770
and freeware tools the freeware tools

324
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:40,260
give you the capability but you need to

325
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,840
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> capability and design how to</font>

326
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,700
operationalize it in your

327
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,409
maybe you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that type of</font>

328
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,380
security team<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you need to buy tools</font>

329
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:52,230
and so and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools do exist</font>

330
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:55,530
and do so much more already packaged out

331
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,900
and so you know build<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus by it's a</font>

332
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:01,410
common thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're faced with here</font>

333
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:03,030
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the more</font>

334
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">powerful things out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is the</font>

335
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,260
network correlation piece it's tying

336
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:10,140
together network security data versus

337
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:13,470
endpoint security data and that alone I

338
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,530
think is worth the<font color="#CCCCCC"> price of admission in</font>

339
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,420
getting this type of capability set up

340
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:22,160
so thank everyone for for listening to

341
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,160
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and got me pushing</font>

342
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:26,330
you
