a survey of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic because I thought</font>

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,429
at least it's not the time people I have

27
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,650
deep experience with it I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort</font>

28
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,360
of give you an overview so as we go

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">through sections please feel free to</font>

us all spinning so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

34
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,160
about where's this used what the

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,410
protocol looks like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you as an</font>

00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,550
individual researcher interact we think

37
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:50,700
or usually in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your home or work some</font>

38
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:54,000
really basic tax on network mapping

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,179
these interview 15 points a B are used

44
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,960
and you see they're sort of pitch down

45
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:17,100
right there there's all the cool

46
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:18,930
asian smart energy but some of these

47
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,460
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we we have to take away from</font>

their market share is continually

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,679
improving that's great<font color="#CCCCCC"> news to them we</font>

55

just<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be concerned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about security</font>

56
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,360
at the same time so what do we call all

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those things on the lights those are</font>

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,020
really attack surfaces for attackers

59
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:48,450
that all are tied into this protocol so

60
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,550
some devices right if we look back at

61
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,410
this screen would have on their building

62
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,780
controls more an<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy some of those</font>

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:57,960
things might be home security systems

<font color="#CCCCCC">these are really nice features to the</font>

69
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,350
does the protocol look like what did you

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a user of these devices either at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">home in business maybe you want to</font>

72
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,900
understand what's happening here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not</font>

73
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:23,250
accept at all at face value so a little

74
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,680
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the difference right here we have</font>

75
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">our little modified OS is Dax so we can</font>

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,990
see our different layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be</font>

77
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,910
talking mainly today for the sake of

78
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:36,750
building a basis that<font color="#CCCCCC"> define the mac</font>

79
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:39,630
layer so that's technically known as 80

83
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,240
things like 6lowpan if you guys have

84
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,840
looked at ipv6 over low-power wireless

85
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,890
that's the protocol that does that so in

86
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,470
general<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have a bunch of</font>

00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:01,799
topologies starve massenet loops these

88
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:04,800
are really nice ways to build self

89
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,470
healing systems device classes there's

90
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,190
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> three full functionality which</font>

91

is your coordinators

routers Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You things plugged into an</font>

93
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,870
outlet and then reduced functionality

94
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:19,839
with a little dorset to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jean new</font>

00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,929
I little door lock that for some reason

97
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,150
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be able unlock to me a key</font>

internet-connected all of those things

100
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,320
are those reduced functionality spices

101
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,260
and then very interestingly there is I

102
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,599
mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to skip over this</font>

103
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:44,170
there is security Bates into the system

104
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,500
right I you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the choice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as an</font>

through encryption authenticity so

107
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,560
you're basically H max or both you have

108
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,240
to be careful which one you choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

109
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,430
can't you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose something and</font>

110
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,560
that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where we see a lot of the</font>

115
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,380
will show you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do later there's</font>

116

others that are great<font color="#CCCCCC"> i but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you</font>

117
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,070
read the developer documentation for

00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:21,370
some of these they warn you that it

119
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,980
takes you know 32<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 16 kilobytes of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">off to the company so we just need to</font>

123
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,330
take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at those when we're auditing</font>

124
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,430
these just because it uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> zigbee which</font>

125
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,080
is a protocol that does support security

126
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,810
doesn't mean the developer chose to

127
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,810
enabling or to handle the keys securely

128
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:51,570
so all of us i'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of us are</font>

129
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:54,000

there's a lot of interesting into

145
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,229
relationships between fields in this

146
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,630
protocol that you have to get back both

147
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:35,820
as a device implementer but also if

148
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,889
you're trying to attack it you have to

149
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,110
be careful about forging frames that are

150
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:44,039
valid you can't just choose one of these

151
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:46,199
right hex editing the frame and be fine

152
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,900
sending your attack it may just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail the</font>

153
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:51,690
protocols back so how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in</font>

154
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:55,200
here have used<font color="#CCCCCC"> scabby before Scotty if</font>

155
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:59,180
you want call it familiar with it what

156
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,889
type of protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you done I IP tcp</font>

157
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:06,349
so gay<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well thanks for using the</font>

158
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,349
duty when you own or did you download oh

159
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:16,169
thank you did he push the code back

160
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:17,610
please go yet thank you yes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm glad</font>

161
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are using it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what I was</font>

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting at with that is we have</font>

167
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">because all of those relationships are a</font>

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,560
top right and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying we got them</font>

porous or to attack this protocol i

172
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:48,409
started off building these frames by

173
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:51,319
hand and a hex editor and that turned

174
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:55,369
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really dumb idea on because</font>

00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:15,109
getting into<font color="#CCCCCC"> some interesting stuff and</font>

184
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:16,549
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not endorsed and you</font>

185
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,379
can make sure that you can legally<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

186
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:22,878
any of this right interfering with other

187
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:24,349
transmissions of jamming and we see at

188
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,469
least in my audits I've seen more and

189
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:30,349
more people put in jamming detection as

190
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:32,029
a countermeasure if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the set</font>

191
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:35,448
the next one down comes into play

00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:37,610
collision sometimes called<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flex if</font>

193
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,679
jamming so you can do jamming where

194
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,289
you're constantly transmitting right I'm

195
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,088
just flooding your channel with noise

196
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:47,589
traditional like military way of

197
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:51,199
interfering with adversarial radios or

198
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:52,939
old a 02 11 attacks right good luck axes

199
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,819
in that hot spot because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm filling the</font>

200
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:58,430
air with noise but people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have started</font>

201
00:08:55,819 --> 00:09:00,199
implementing to notice that and report

202
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,329
that especially in security systems that

203
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:04,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">they want to know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody's flooding</font>

and going to break into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the house so</font>

205
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:09,729
then you get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> only jamming when you</font>

206
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:12,649
want to collide<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a specific fame</font>

211
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:25,129
through most of these fast because they

talking on low power devices this is

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,519
somewhat taxable in about one to two

217
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,980

up somebody's entire memory table

00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,990
because they don't check their balance

222
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,959
on their memory tables not saying people

223
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,430
don't do that but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they did you know</font>

224
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,339
we might want to fill up their limited

232
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,899
don't do a lot of checks so let's start

233
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,880
off by just saying you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the</font>

package<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to start i am going to</font>

235
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,899
hope at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've given you some</font>

236
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,519
reason to either fall asleep oh I'm

237
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,260
saying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least learn</font>

238
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,070
how to play with this protocol and I'm

239
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,930
not offended<font color="#CCCCCC"> if either so seeing the</font>

240
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,790
packets and being able to send them you

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an ethernet adapter you can't</font>

242
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,240
just plug into your laptop and start

243
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:37,060
doing this so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to get some fun</font>

244
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,070
things out there's a variety of hardware

245
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,680
options I there's positives and minor

some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are hardware from companies</font>

248
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,870

260
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:24,910
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> great attack platforms if you</font>

can acquire them but you know when we

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,079
went through all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> and working</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for about three years of research on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

264
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:34,000
these platforms a while ago I sort of

265
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,790
grew to a point where there were the

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,440
limitations on each that were running

267
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,329
into penetration testing because none of

268
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,069
these frankly we were designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

269
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:44,560
happy platform right there's many

270
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,490
legitimate uses for them so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font>

271
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,670
say there's also

272
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:52,720
legitimate used to this I'm sure there

273
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:54,699
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't design it to that I designed</font>

274
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,250

00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,899
yourselves understanding what's going on

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,790
in their networks without relying on

277
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:01,930
fender tools without relying on what

278
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,349
somebody tells you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a piece of</font>

279
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,649

280
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:13,209
board sobeida board it's open source

281
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:15,040
because legitimate uses include you

282
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:17,800
could add expansion boards and use this

283
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a development board less legitimate</font>

284
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,959
uses or you can you know we optimize

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,339
things to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> on-board storage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

if you want to throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> this over a fence</font>

287
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,050
and capture packets having a pretty good

288
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,690
microprocessor so you can do processing

289
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:35,250
on the board passing that directly USB

290
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:37,690
if you're lazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> in like Python like me</font>

291
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,420
having a radio<font color="#CCCCCC"> front end that has an</font>

292
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,890
extremely<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> radio chip there so</font>

293
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,380
that you can play with stuff like we'll

294
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,390
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this talk that</font>

295
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,860
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other boards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't</font>

296
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,600
allow you to do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

297
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,459
staying within the protocol spec you

298
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,670
should never need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that but that's</font>

299
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:57,250
no fun having either an internal and

300
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:00,880
external radio so that say you were

301
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,649
legally allowed to do jamming all we're

302
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,800
doing it in a controlled space you could

303
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:09,279
do some antenna boosting and interfere

304
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:13,000
with packets so this goes through some

305
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,950
of the architecture of that board<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

309
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:24,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I've discussed either the</font>

310
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:29,490
motivation or the fact that you can't

311
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,649
plug in to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> air with USB or Ethernet</font>

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:35,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay cool I'm glad were there is</font>

313
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:36,800
everyone still awake there's beer in the

314
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:41,180
back you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab some and drink it</font>

315
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:47,540
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation more exciting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> man out oh</font>

316
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:50,390
well that's your personal phone oh yeah

317
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry I should this is a nappy mode this</font>

318
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,790
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> version for this is a beta void I</font>

319
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,130
refused<font color="#E5E5E5"> to release it not as beta</font>

320
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:00,709
because sometimes you have to try to

321
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:04,209
boot it up twice for it to work I'm not

322

<font color="#E5E5E5">a PCD designer that's probably why odd</font>

323
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:08,029

324
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,790
new version there's a lot smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

325
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:12,350
cheaper<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a little less flexible that</font>

326
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,800
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> work better for some people coming</font>

327
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">out soon if all sitting in my lab trying</font>

328
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,060
waiting to be soldered to see if they

329
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,439
even would but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an app emo you</font>

330
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,420
can go i'll give you a link at the end

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,850
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk where you can find this the</font>

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,670
documentation and source code and board

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,410
designs on github if you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> one you</font>

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">can come talk to me because trust me</font>

335
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:35,269
it's a pain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solder by hand so I've</font>

336
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,939
stopped doing that and just have

337
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:39,500
manufacturing houses make them but the

338
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,810
goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this out into the hands</font>

339
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,579
of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a relatively low cost to</font>

340
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:49,180
allow them to play with wireless on

341
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:49,180
their own and see it does that<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>

342
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,610
alright so now I have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

343
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,310
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've chosen one of those boys i</font>

344
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,740
plug it in what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do what's the first</font>

345
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:01,290
thing I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting at home I'm interested</font>

346
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:06,480
in seeing I thought if I have zigbee in

347
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:08,730
my house Killer Bee is a framework it's

348
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,920
also online it's on google code when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

349
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,690
will soon be moving in I guess that's no

350
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,719
longer supported should have moved it a

351
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:18,360
long time ago I have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move it</font>

352
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,020
from last night's other day so it'll get

353
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,120
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> um but these are it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Python</font>

354
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,300
library that interacts with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

355
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:32,070
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of those boys we started</font>

356
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:36,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">off back in two thousand nine minutes so</font>

357
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:38,220
by Josh Reich who then handed it off to

358
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,960
me and we've made a lot of changes to

359
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it more interoperable between</font>

360
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,940
private web interfaces and acid features

361
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,800
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talk quickly about what</font>

362
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,540
these tools do my goal here is to not

363
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,829
teach you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to use each of them I'm</font>

364
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to leave you to help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> files</font>

365
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,320
from the command line the dash<font color="#CCCCCC"> h flag is</font>

366
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,340
probably a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to get started and</font>

367
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,360
complain if it's not clear because

368
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:01,800
that's my fault but ZB ID is hey tell me

369
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,360
which side where interfaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

370
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,979
plugged into my computer I make sure

371
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're there ZB dump is like TCP dump</font>

372
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,190
right except physic me CB Wireshark it's

373
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,870
like Wyatt right seven it is it just

374
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,510
takes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> zigbee packets and feeds them</font>

375
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,820
in there ZB stumble ooh we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

376
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,730
get to and take a deeper dive into in a

377
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,280
few slides but this is sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like you</font>

378
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">kismet in active mode how do I go out</font>

379
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,510
and ping for networks and get a list of

380
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,550
the networks that are out there in my

381
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,220
environment so I break those down

382
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,569
because if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing an attack on new</font>

383
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,130
system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting started by the</font>

384
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,530
first thing these are sort of the

385
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,450
groupings of things i do right make sure

386
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:45,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> devices plugged in and then I'm</font>

387
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:47,190
not you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> being dumb make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

388
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,800
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fames and find the network and</font>

389
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">then go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the other tools don't skip</font>

390
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,209
light to the last ones because you'll

391
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,429
start email

392
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:55,569
me and wondering you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> why it's not</font>

393
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:57,639
looking you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

394
00:16:55,569 --> 00:17:00,490
channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network twist and that's</font>

395
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,730
what the other ones can help with it so

396
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,709
Z be fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of by war walking I</font>

397
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,649
want to walk around<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a laptop and find</font>

398
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:11,199
the node hidden in the ceiling tile ZB

399
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:12,819
replay sort of like tcp / you play by

400
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">the names are not supposed to be trick</font>

401
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:17,139
questions the names are supposed to

402
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:19,630
recreate what we're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to for TCP</font>

403
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:22,419
and IP but deal with a different network

404
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,189
stack so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some tools but</font>

405
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:25,990
killaby really is not meant to be used

406
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:28,260
from a list of tools at the command line

407
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,580
those are there to get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

408
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,010
really the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power</font>

409
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,260
to script up you out attacks so let's

410
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:38,980
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

411
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:47,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so ZB</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stumble Oh what did I</font>

412
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:51,039
tell you it did yeah 55 netstumbler type

413
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,750
things so just like in 802 11 8 0 to 15

414
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,629
for needs to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its being</font>

415
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:58,600
and find its routing and so what it does

416
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:01,299
is it has this network key concepts it

417
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">sends out a beacon request framing it's</font>

418
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:04,840
back a beacon fairly standard handshake

419
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,620
pretty diagrams out of their

420
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,629
documentation all great it discloses

421
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,719
things that are useful to us like the

422
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">network identification the extending</font>

423
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,169
that would identification which is the

424
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,320
mac address of the coordinator so you

do this you<font color="#E5E5E5"> UCB stumble ooh because you</font>

familiar with scape e this is make me

440
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,720
concatenate a frame together basically

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,110
make me Abby

can frame set its sequence number say

that you care about security set the

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually send a beacon request and then</font>

453
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:42,030
you'd sniff to get back the beacon

454
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:45,390
response and push that out does that

455
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:47,280
make sense everyone feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like there's</font>

472
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:54,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so let's try this again like it</font>

like played with kids mad bathroom stuff

475
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,860
great awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is fairly standard my</font>

476
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:05,409
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> here being it's not that different</font>

477
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,899
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different protocol attack surface</font>

478
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,580
that just hasn't been<font color="#CCCCCC"> exploded as much</font>

479
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:13,360
it just hasn't caught in the mainstream

480
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:15,250
with tools and ability to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and</font>

481
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,830
explore it from an attackers perspective

482
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:20,230
so wardriving helps you understand

483
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,090
prevalence recommended administrators

484
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,440
who use the system understand their

485
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,120
attack surface right that's all those

486
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,990
nice defensive full of points about why

487
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,899
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good a few things to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

488
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:35,080
as a as opposed to Wi-Fi you really have

489
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:37,330
to monitor on national channels this is

490
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,820
a low-power wireless network which means

491
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,699
it's not spewing youtube video packets

492
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,320
all over like you used to in a fine and

493
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,140
you do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to elicit a response</font>

494
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,149
from the nodes to see where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

495
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,910
because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> will just try and not to</font>

496
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:54,460
talk to save battery so say you walk

497
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:57,100
around to this one that's on vote so you

498
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,710
go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you collect a lot of samples then</font>

499
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:03,070
we can make a pretty graph and do some

500
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:06,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">RF GIS and tribulation on the signal</font>

501
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:08,980
strength values there and so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

502
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:12,699
proves is you can make a purple<font color="#E5E5E5"> and blue</font>

503
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:16,000
map which means nothing except if you

504
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:19,480
overlay and start to notice this debts

505
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,660
blue area in the bottom and I call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

506
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,870
out here is when you look at the utility

507
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:28,360
diagrams for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> area for this town</font>

508
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,909
there's actually underground tunnels

509
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,149
that are used for steam a moving steam

510
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:35,620
from building to building and those are

511
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:39,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of the steam pipes are controlled</font>

512
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:41,889
with data to 15 for hardware and<font color="#CCCCCC"> saxs so</font>

513
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,720
deeper blue stronger signal the

514
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:47,680
interpolation even though we didn't walk

515
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,570
over those areas per se you now start to

516
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,910
see when you do the math<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you see</font>

517
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,759
that that there is at least some

518
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:57,579
semblance I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying it's perfect</font>

519
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:59,799
of being able to find where things are

520
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:03,999
especially underground because their

521
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:05,709
stuff to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sub attacks I told you</font>

522
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:08,320
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful about your</font>

523
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:10,869
security knows how to not just choose

524
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:16,599
them randomly so one that they present

525
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:19,478
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a es CTR mode great aes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Fitch</font>

526
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:22,658
validated good encryption cool probably

527
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:24,489
great this didn't have any authenticity

528
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:26,889
on it now so it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Christian fine</font>

529
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:28,389
maybe I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about authenticity if</font>

530
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:30,758
you're designing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a crypto protocol I</font>

531
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:32,498
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest you do but if you don't</font>

532
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:35,009
for some reason some people chose this

533
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:38,319
and then they shipped devices with it

534
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:40,599
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue was access control was</font>

535
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,369
just based on the sending address which

536
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">is two bites and you can just sniff</font>

537
00:23:42,369 --> 00:23:47,079
those because they're not protected and

538
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:50,019
data protection was on a group loud and

539
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,549
so they have a table<font color="#CCCCCC"> in memory of who is</font>

540
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:53,559
the sender and who's the receiver in

541
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:55,418
what key should be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they</font>

542
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:57,428
have sequential freshness because they

543
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:58,929
didn't want me play attacks but they

544
00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:01,389
just store that in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wasn't</font>

545
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:04,869
authenticated in the frame right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so does</font>

546
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:07,089
anyone see an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue with this ok so this</font>

547
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:10,379
like no surprise here right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

548
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:14,948
an old attack way 2006 it was originally

549
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:16,988
discussed publicly um if you don't

550
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:18,729
validate your the encrypted payload to

551
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:20,589
see if it makes sense then I can put

552
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:22,359
anything in that and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can mess</font>

553
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:25,149
with your frame counter to be all apps

554
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:26,859
and then you take that blindly and you

555
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:29,289
put it because of the flow in the

556
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:31,029
protocol and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you store that off in your</font>

557
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:32,739
counter and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next legitimate</font>

558
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:35,379
frame comes and guess what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to</font>

559
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:37,449
be less than all s and so you start

560
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:41,228
rejecting thing great I now have a one

561
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:45,159
frame denial of service so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want this</font>

562
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:50,499
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be possible to do so let's take a</font>

563
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:52,149
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some code that does this this is</font>

564
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:54,399
the idea that you have a database this

565
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:55,860
is some old code<font color="#E5E5E5"> ZB</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Forge I don't use</font>

566
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:57,780
this in my attacks anymore

567
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:00,449
I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still up in in the source</font>

568
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:02,129
control if you want basically through

569
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,780
sniffing the network you can build a

570
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,070
model of it in the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> state of the</font>

571
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">network so that you know different</font>

572
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,809
devices you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull off that current</font>

573
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,879
state why is this important all you

574
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:13,590
really need is a sequence number you

575
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,360
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess that it's only a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one bite</font>

576
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,809
field but let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do it nice</font>

577
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,820
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy we're then going to go ahead</font>

578
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:24,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">and create a frame using that</font>

579
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:29,399
information set our addresses to the

580
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:31,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">target that we want to attack and then</font>

581
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,760
here's where the actual attack is for

582
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:35,429
weaponization right we say we want to

583
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">use security we set that frame counter</font>

584
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:41,669
to be the maximum integer it is an

585
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:44,429
unsigned we say that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the key</font>

586
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:48,120
indexing mode so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry they explain</font>

587
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:50,090
this one more step it has a key index

588
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,110
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so that you can roll keys</font>

589
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,780
eventually when this frame counter does

590
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:57,059
fill up and then as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fame counter so</font>

591
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,620
the idea is you fill up the the four

592
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:01,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">base frame counter than you all to the</font>

593
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,418
next key right and so we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say both</font>

594
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,830
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been totally used up because we're</font>

595
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:07,500
lazy and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to deal</font>

596
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:11,399
with repeating our attack and then we

597
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:14,760
send it and so this luckily is not being

598
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,250
used in any devices that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know of that</font>

599
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have personally held in my hands on</font>

600
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:23,850
the market today I'm sure it's being

601
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:25,350
used somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the end I'm sure the</font>

602
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,059
old systems that used to be shipped

603
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,678
haven't been replaced<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet because when</font>

604
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:33,928
you do critical infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

605
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:35,370
replace your systems often so that's one

606
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:37,350
thing to look for that's one way that

607
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,870
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the killer bee and scampi</font>

tools to do that attack another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

619
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:08,080
an issue right they either doing a

targeted<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame based on recon or just</font>

621
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,619
flooding the network with disassociation

622
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:13,899
famous going back to 802 11 attacks

623
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:18,158
these same things just repeat themselves

624
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:20,979
today in this protocol last attack i'm

625
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,950
going to go through quickly is reflexive

626
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:26,619
jamming doing constant jamming is boring

627
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:29,559
because it takes no skill in my opinion

628
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:32,470
and people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look for it</font>

629
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:35,590
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do covert operation of</font>

630
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,970
your jamming if you want to not use up

631
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,399
all of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a week now we're trying</font>

conversion to work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 504 um then</font>

636
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:53,199
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do Jeremy reflexive</font>

637
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:55,600
jamming so say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

638
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,429
protocol you mess with acknowledgments

639
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,740
you can mess with the actual data frames

640
00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:03,039
but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

641
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a protocol that sends a heartbeat</font>

642
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,820
frame to make sure it's still connected

643
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:09,129
and the device hasn't been stolen and

644
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,600
smashed with a hammer and then another

645
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:12,340
frame to communicate the really

646
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,490
important data so the heartbeat let's

647
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:17,350
say happens every minute and the really

648

<font color="#E5E5E5">important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data happens when you break</font>

00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,899
power plant cousin issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now what</font>

651
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,918
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> an issue if those are two</font>

652
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:33,939
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> lengths specifically if they</font>

653
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:35,799
were vastly different lengths anyone

654
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,659
have an idea you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them apart</font>

655
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,090
right they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be encrypted all you want</font>

656
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:42,159
they can be well protected under all of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the same yes that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very happy is in</font>

658
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,639
the protocol they can be signed with

659
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:48,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">hmmm but if they're different lengths</font>

660
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:49,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I experiment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this system then</font>

661
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,908
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start to see the</font>

662
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,330
differences there so one attack i would

663
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:54,950
suggest you turn

664
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,980
attention to if you don't like playing

665
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:00,800
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> AES at a low level is looking at</font>

666
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,260
something like this so we when I've

667
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,909
implemented this before and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasons we use the radio chip on the</font>

669
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">abbey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mode we do is we have an access to</font>

670
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:13,040
a hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> into outline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the second to</font>

672
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:18,500

673
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,990
frame then<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's wait a certain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

674
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:25,010
of milliseconds and then send out a

675
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:28,250
blast of shorts energy so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a frame</font>

676
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:31,400
start coming in we get a GPIO li-ion the

677
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:33,980
hardware we start a timer that we

678
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:37,040
accurately<font color="#E5E5E5"> tune and then we blast out</font>

679
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:39,220
some data what's the idea here<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

680
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:44,620
your short height beat frame skips by

681
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:48,830
your longer data frame gets a collision

682
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:52,129
so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fames these</font>

683
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:54,679
frames all 13 bites I let's see it's

684
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:58,130
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a beacon frame so this one's</font>

685
00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:00,410
actually fairly standard I have any non

686
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:03,680
endian frames to show you of the attack

687
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:06,710
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I described is possible so beacon</font>

688
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,660
frames yay I you'll see that when we

689
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,760
activate the jammer we start to get Fame

690
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:13,970
checksum airs and this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

691
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,100
Wireshark output of the packets and so

692
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,810
what happens if it device gets Fame

693
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,399
checksum airs like a commercial<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font>

694
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:22,429
not a sniffer we're using in promiscuous

695
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,930
matter what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely why do you think</font>

696
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:28,040
they even check<font color="#CCCCCC"> the checks do they check</font>

697
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:29,540
for tracks are likely to discard the

698
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,300
packet right so that seemed like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

699
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">ferrous option</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will tell you that it</font>

700
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,740
is typically a fair assumption if you

701
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:40,159
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't believe me I I encourage you</font>

radio noise collided you could do two

705
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,260
things at this point you can forge an

just keep jamming it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're lazy</font>

I hair trend this one with<font color="#CCCCCC"> an sto yeah I</font>

713
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:18,690
guess I did huh so this was on a usrp to

714
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:22,770
edit research<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks I've not tried it on</font>

716
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:27,420
could you could do this right you could

717
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,130
push<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down into that PDA the issue is</font>

718
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,230
we were having with this being such a

719
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:33,270
short time frame if we were being lazy

720
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,980
and piping it back so the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> post</font>

00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:37,680
computer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the determination and</font>

722
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,210
then send out the jam you just host into

ups on the computer when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it working fast</font>

724
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:43,050

750
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:59,729

751
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:01,619
protocol diagrams sort of like what

752
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:03,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">people tell you is what's actually on</font>

753
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:05,549
the wire that's the total lie about

754
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,769
what's actually on the lion right so

755
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:10,489
that was all up here that was this this

756
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:13,499
section but to actually get your

757
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:15,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">transmittal and to have this be picked</font>

758
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:17,489
up by another radio radios have to

759
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:20,249
synchronize two clock cycles so that

760
00:33:17,489 --> 00:33:22,559
they're in step on so forth and they

761
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:25,109
have to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start listening see if</font>

this preamble<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started frame delimiter</font>

763
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:29,009
which is a fancy magic bite than the

764
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:34,589
length of the frames you know how long

765
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:37,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">to listen to for and so what I take my</font>

767
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:44,700

768
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:49,440
the fame in 802 15 for spec what if we

769
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:54,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about flowing another logical 5</font>

771
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:58,468

772
00:33:56,129 --> 00:34:00,509
a new srp you can go ahead and control

773
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:03,479
whatever you like but if you're using a

774
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:06,989
commodity radio you may not have often

775

looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a poor man's way to inject</font>

779
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:22,138
on commodity hardware and this was

780

research we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> pakman packet Travis</font>

782
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:32,190
other people did back in 2011 something

783
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:32,950
I but basically what you do is because

784
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:35,520
there's no no

785
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:39,098
whitening because there's no complex

786
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,800
radio encoding happening here is we just

787
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:45,339
take the outer<font color="#E5E5E5"> fame and we shove it</font>

788
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,290
inside right and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we have the out</font>

789
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:49,270
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fame that the radio transmits like it</font>

790
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,040
usually should and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start with a</font>

791
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:53,619
new preamble a new start a frame

<font color="#E5E5E5">our packet and so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> packing inside</font>

794
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:01,329
a packet but not the most creative name

795
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:11,230
so should<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work what do you guys</font>

796
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:13,450
think yeah yep similar that this exact

797
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:16,890
thing is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little different feeling</font>

798
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:20,529
hopping works where is this technique on

799
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:22,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet would not typically look</font>

800
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">although an Italian research group took</font>

801
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:28,270
our paper and did make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with</font>

special<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardware on Ethernet so you have</font>

to have impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sets been applied</font>

804
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:34,029
it's a little different than female

805
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,770
comic but same concept right and so

806
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,569
typically that should just<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

807
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,130
payload<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is the payload of the fan</font>

808
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:42,460
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what the protocol tells</font>

809
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:44,920
us but what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> a radio doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear that</font>

810
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:47,349
because that that happens right in<font color="#E5E5E5"> radio</font>

811
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:51,250
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> errors or there's a collision or</font>

812
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:56,319
there's noise introduced and so with

813
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:58,960
some amount of regularity actually you

814
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:00,640
will see the inner frame be interpreted

815
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,210
and captured by a device instead of the

816
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,040
outer one just as a matter of radio

817
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:08,500
noise playing into it and what's

818
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,500
interesting here is when you combine

819
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:15,760
this two with another piece of research

820
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:18,040
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it more reliable so packing a</font>

821
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,040
packet is nice we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find veins control</font>

822
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,170
inside the package we did some<font color="#CCCCCC"> work I</font>

823
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,650
the research group i used to be a part

00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:30,260
over then<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself and my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> company</font>

825
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:33,180

radio<font color="#CCCCCC"> tips not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the firmware level</font>

827
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,419
amount of the software level but at the

828
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:38,460
actual chip level how does it state

829
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,990
machine work and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> read through a</font>

830
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,569
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> really boring state machine</font>

831
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:44,819
diagrams and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ones we couldn't</font>

832
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:48,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">get access to we postulated about and</font>

833
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:50,430
then you locate the fact that you let's

834
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:52,650
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take my word for it if we can make</font>

835
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,950
a package such that some radios receive

836
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:57,420
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outer packet and others don't</font>

837
00:36:54,950 --> 00:37:00,629
then we have some control of doing a

838
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:03,539
win's evasion so thank your wind system

839
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:07,079
is using one type of radio check to

840
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:08,250
listen right and your target system that

841
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,910
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect is using</font>

842
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:14,849
another type of radio chip then if we

843
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:17,009
can find a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to have that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wind</font>

00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:18,960
systems radio chip not even process it

845
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:21,390
as a valid packet not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there</font>

846
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,390
was a packet there but your actual

847
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:27,240
target system does we've now done a

848
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,400
width of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Asian and gone in to against</font>

849
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,160
your target system only the heart of

850
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:35,490
firmware on your win system doesn't even

851
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,960
know there was a fan there so there's a

852
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,058
bunch of techniques I'm going to talk

853
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">about one briefly three minutes left</font>

854
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:46,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions is</font>

855
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:48,779
franconia notch we gave names to

856
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:51,869
mountains that we liked I so here's

857
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:56,309
again when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about all zeros and</font>

858
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:59,069
then a<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven in the frame and so what we</font>

859
00:37:56,309 --> 00:38:01,260
did is say what if like we actually put

860
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:03,990
f's there instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we were</font>

861
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,400
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these should be building</font>

862
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,839
the other way I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> i fixed the</font>

863
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,819
automation but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power points</font>

864
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:12,000
we've changed it so franconia notch is

865
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:14,400
actually try with all zeros try with two

866
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,500
apps here try with 2 f's here try with

867
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,170
two you know and keep adding as you go

868
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,760
through and what does this do to a radio

869
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,529
what does it do to its ability that we

870
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,950
cover from this at the very state

871
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:28,500
machine inside the hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so if we</font>

872
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:30,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">won a thousand iterations and a thousand</font>

873
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,250
iterations quite a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> times because we</font>

874
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:37,720
sort of surprised at this result we kept

875
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:40,150
running it is okay if I'm on all zeros

876
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,939
first of all this this radio trip should

877
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:45,550
have caught all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them ideally right so</font>

878
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:49,390
this just shows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the radio chips</font>

879
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:53,380
aren't always picking up everything if

880
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:54,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">we start adding 1</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> F this radio chipset</font>

881
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,670
in its standard mode on the

882
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,549
configuration here is now not picking up

883
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:03,940
any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those sort of surprising it's</font>

884
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:05,770
obviously very attentive to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> spec in</font>

885
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:09,070
its state machine where's this one's

886
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:10,870
more permissive in fact we kept running

887
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:13,780
this so many times because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we couldn't</font>

888
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:15,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe this tribe right and this is off</font>

889
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,770
of 11 but I think we've run this

890
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:20,500
experiment in multiple different

891
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:22,390
geographies like what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on with</font>

892
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the air here right this does not make</font>

893
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,319
sense so I'm acknowledging that and I

894
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,090
would encourage anyone who wants to to

895
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,610
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me buy more iterations because this</font>

896
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:32,650
is crazy but we've gotten these results

897
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:35,260
time after time somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this small</font>

898
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:37,690
point 2 f's we're still doing well

899
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">fiesta is still somehow better than</font>

900
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:42,640
protocol compliant and then all f's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

901
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:46,120
thank goodness we acknowledge that

902
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's not supposed to happen right so</font>

903
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:51,490
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what if this was my</font>

904
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:54,310
target device and this was my width

905
00:39:51,490 --> 00:40:00,850
system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was sending famous format</font>

906
00:39:54,310 --> 00:40:02,950
in this way so some interesting stuff to

907
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,660
play with mother and so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take two</font>

908
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:08,049
packet captures right just to show this

909
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:10,720
again so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CB wire so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I produced</font>

910
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:12,310
capture and I've overlaid one of the

911
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,020
fields because<font color="#E5E5E5"> why Shrek just doesn't</font>

912
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:17,320
seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show me the Phi player when I</font>

913
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:19,090
turn that on so overlaid what the

914
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,740
preamble we were sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on each of</font>

915
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:23,560
those frames that we correlated it back

916
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:25,629
to and we see we're pretty reliably

917
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:29,259
seeing a mix like like we talked about

918
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:31,150
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the before slot previous slide now</font>

919
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:34,150
let's line that up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and show you that</font>

920
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,950
same pcap up top and then at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

921
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">time the exact same frames being</font>

922
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:39,939
transmitted to two devices the same

923
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,040
distance away in the same environment

924
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:45,820
what the app Nemo

925
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:49,420
this is the season 24 22 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> atmel chip</font>

926
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:51,730
chip con ship which texas instruments so

927
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:55,420
now i see sequence number one and then

928
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:58,480
six right so like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where hoop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

929
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eleven lining up and we see like you</font>

930
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,740
can see here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i hope you believe me at</font>

931
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:09,190
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point there's frames that the other</font>

932
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:11,319
ones not seeing coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that's all</font>

933
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:15,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have for you guys today as part</font>

934
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:18,160
of this overview what i want to point

935
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">youtube is because i didn't want to give</font>

936
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,250
you the google co click given that

937
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,250
college a move tonight tomorrow

938
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:26,650
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> doc there are leave something</font>

939
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:30,760
on the top page that will point to the

940
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:33,610
appropriate code repositories for all of

941
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,620
this everything we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> is released open</font>

942
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:38,590
source and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought you guys</font>

943
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:40,720
deserve something fun today so thanks to

944
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:42,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of our guys who stayed up through</font>

945
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,700
the night and just finished it about two

946
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,040
hours ago we have a version of kali

947
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,720
linux customized to be bootable off a

948
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">drive he loaded with killer bee and</font>

949
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,660
optimized for you use so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

950
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:58,390
get started on this don't have a lynx

951
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:01,509
laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to be able to play around</font>

952
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:03,440
the right supposedly works both platform

953
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:07,790
but if you email me that it doesn't

954
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,560
windows my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Miami spots might be that I'm</font>

955
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:12,050
not spent too much time holding into

956
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,870
that I pologize for that but that would

957
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:19,430
require me booting into windows which is

958
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:21,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine so I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NOT posting the link to the</font>

959
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:25,310
ice off here because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to kill</font>

960
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:26,900
my bandwidth but if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it if</font>

961
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:29,440
you guys would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play with this I</font>

962
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:32,330
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it available to you I</font>

963
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,180
to do beta testing with you're going to

964
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:36,799
find issues so come see me I'd love to

965
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,169
point you to it and get you access to

966
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can photon thumb drive boot it</font>

967
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:43,190
up and you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tools</font>

968
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:52,180
pre-installed and if not then its

969
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:56,620
clients falling any questions about

970
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:56,620
eight minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> before i get my way</font>

971
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,700
because

972
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,040
responds that way

973
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,050
I wouldn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that a vendor</font>

974
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,820
would do something with that but I don't

975
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,170
know what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> will tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you is when we</font>

976
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,060
look through all of their documentation

977
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:31,640
there was nothing they caused it to

978
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:35,420
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was intentional or this was</font>

979
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:38,319
published<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how but I you know the</font>

980
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:40,940
isotope fingerprinting research we have

981
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,260
Franconia Notch about four others<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

982
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,000
we've got out and there's a technical

983
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,340
paper published on the comparisons

984
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,440
between them and when you start we

985
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,960
looked across six different types of

986
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,550
devices and using a combination of two

987
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,470
of those techniques you can reliably

988
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:56,870
being who you're talking to say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

989
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:59,359
do that not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> slip something passed a</font>

990
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,680
whiz but just to see who sends you an

991
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,870
acknowledgement frame saying they got

992
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,399
your packet now you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> active</font>

993
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:06,380
close to fingerprinting right or the

994
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,290
equivalent to that what we call that

995
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:12,650
with that map and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's interesting</font>

996
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:17,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more research they</font>

997
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:20,000
can be done at that level I want to

998
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:22,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank my onyx security and my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> applied</font>

research team for putting up with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1000
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,000
helping on this as well as Travis good

1001
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,510
speed so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys and many other people</font>

1002
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that worked with me over the years on</font>

1003

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> zigbee an 80</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 foil research any</font>

1004
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:39,140
other questions did any of those

1005
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:41,029
chipsets talk about their don't care

1006
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:43,069
conditions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the state machine because</font>

1007
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:46,970
that will you can get in to some

1008
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:49,130
dangerous situations with having don't

1009
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:50,450
care conditions existing in a state

1010
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:53,900
machine

1011
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:56,549
that can put you out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an expected</font>

1012
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,500
sequence like yeah what was interesting

1013
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">is when we went back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at some</font>

1014
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these state machines after looking at</font>

1015
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:05,310
these results we're like okay we could

1016
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:07,020
see how this would happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we see</font>

1017
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,240
wearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state machine minds</font>

1018
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,470
happening yeah but there wasn't in any

1019
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,709
of the state machines that I can

1020
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:15,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember and please check me on this</font>

1021
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,520
nothing that i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember did i see</font>

1022
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,520
like this will fail out in these

1023
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">conditions and that is expecting yes</font>

1024
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,840
there was a lot of empirical testing to

1025
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:27,780
figure out which these we came up with

1026
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:30,720
the ideas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to try not based on a</font>

1027
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:33,960
spec sheet looking at rigidness truth

1028
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,299
tables and those what truth tables in

1029
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,030
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the state machines yeah so they</font>

1030
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,230
didn't have any but we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1031
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:43,050
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed you was sort of all</font>

1032
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,610
resulting yeah and so we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1033
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,290
taking pieces of white paper and

1034
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:48,540
scribbling in what we could control with

1035
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:50,460
a man innovations but few nights and

1036
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:54,150
figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what was actually useful a</font>

1037
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:58,400
lot more did you have a question over

1038
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:58,400
there I thought I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font>
