IT security and yet it's my job to

19
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,860
essentially sell the program and as I

20
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:30,089
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> with people I realized we're not</font>

21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:33,539
good at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so take a moment examine</font>

22
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,209
yourself right in our community people

23
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:38,490
see themselves in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

24
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:40,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways right and if you look within our</font>

25
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,220
community we have these sub communities

26
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,569
and these sub-communities sometimes I

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,119
mean people who think<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't the cyber</font>

28
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:52,950
hacker type right we all know these guys

29
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:55,860
and girls that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just cyber</font>

30
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,289
hackers right and in ninja lead people

31
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,259
some folks see themselves as a friendly

32
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:04,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">superhero out there to save the day and</font>

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:08,380
be happy with the business and I just

34
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,630
I'm doing awesome today

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,880
and lastly we have the economic last

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,970
it's the person that no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> understands</font>

37
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,840
in deep in his heart he has desires to

38
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:21,690
rule the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world right generally all of us</font>

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,330
fall into one or more of these things

40
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,340
but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue is is the</font>

41
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:30,090
people of business<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we deal with</font>

42
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:34,540
don't see us the way we see ourselves

43
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:39,520
they see us as wizards and explain we

44
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:42,239
dress funny right we really do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,140
strange implements that do bizarre and

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,190
amazing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't</font>

47
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,260
understand and most importantly we we

48
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">have women in our community who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

49
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,600
generally smarter faster better than the

50
00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:01,720
guys kick ass harder but always the

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:04,359
second building what is up with that so

52
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,700
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is me well talking about again</font>

53
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,680
touch with me one thing I do the

54
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,869
Southern Fried security podcast the

55
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,220
number one atlanta-based information

56
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,420
security podcast Andrew nothing personal

57
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,790
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really proud of</font>

58
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,829
that Johnson<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also on the</font>

62
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,580
stickers we have those so shall<font color="#E5E5E5"> we begin</font>

63
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:35,040
and let's let's talk through this thing

64
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:37,810
so the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,700
get rid of this language<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we use</font>

66
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,070
amongst ourselves which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

67
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,079
effective and really efficient the

68
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,329
challenges is that when we turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,800
and use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

70
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:56,890
business it sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this take a</font>

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:04:00,940
moment I know I'm crossing multiple mean

72
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:03,850
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> but this is how we sound to the</font>

73
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:07,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">business right which causes them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

74
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:10,640
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> us with this expression</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on their face</font>

75
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,890
right and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past that was okay</font>

76
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,839
right if you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in information</font>

77
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,269
security for a while there were the days

78
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,700
when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threw metric</font>

79
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:22,870
boatloads of money at us to make

80
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,909
problems go away and we said magic<font color="#E5E5E5"> words</font>

81
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,850
right hey we bought all these shiny

82
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,340
boxes that blinky lights right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

83
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:35,030
engineers questionable personal hygiene

84
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:43,760
that managed to Donald A Center didn't

85
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:46,640
work so how do you fix it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you</font>

86
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,610
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to explain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the processes</font>

87
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:53,300
and the technologies we use to your

88
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,340
organization in ways they understand the

89
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,070
number one way people learn and if

90
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,679
you're a parent you know this it's by

91
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,020
analogy<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I've been health care right</font>

92
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,570
so I had a conversation my second week

93
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,609
at the hospital talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature</font>

94
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,140
antiviruses we were about to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

95
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,950
substantial renewal with their signature

96
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,330
AV company and not my CI to but my co is

97
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,460
that I read an article that said it

98
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,609
wasn't worth it why are we doing this I

99
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,560
have a great chief operating officer and

100
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,860
I use this city rabies at the flu

101
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,050
vaccine you know it works great for the

102
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,180
strings they planned<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but the</font>

103
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,340
other strings that have mutated out not

104
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">so much this year's flu vaccine is only</font>

105
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,419
about fifteen percent active fifty

106
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,400
percent effective against the majority

107
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,590
of the strings that are going around

108
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:44,620
does that sound like the antivirus that

109
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,619
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> put on our end points so</font>

110
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,750
also use real life as an analogy that

111
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,400
was asked on a previous deploy what

112
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,580
intrusion detection was all about and

113
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's like a gate guard right she'll look</font>

114
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,370
at the cars coming through and she'll

115
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,020
follow the procedure but you know so

116
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,870
what it really wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get past the</font>

117
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:09,750
gate guard they can isn't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

118
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:10,950
error so what do you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is well</font>

119
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,430
if you're going to communicate

120
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">effectively with the business please for</font>

121
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:20,669
all that is holy if you only hear one

122
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,470
thing today hear this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> must fight the</font>

123
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,960
urge to prove you're the smartest person

124
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:28,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the room this is the number one</font>

125
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,590
cardinal sin all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us you included do</font>

126
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,870
on a regular basis and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we doing in the</font>

127
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,460
center community and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay right</font>

128
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,590
because there's this one-upsmanship we'd

129
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:41,190
love to do to each other right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

130
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's okay right you start doing this</font>

131
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,410
with you know the HR director or the

132
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,790
supply chain people and you're not

133
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:52,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as someone who's fun to be</font>

134
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,820
around haha your look you're a dick

135
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:58,890
right the next thing we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

136
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,650

that means other compensating controls

though that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the that's the thinks of</font>

341
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,450
when I talk about biomedical devices

342
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,920
being patient safety issues I'm gaining

343
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,320
a huge amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traction inside the</font>

344
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,349
environment because it's scaring my

345
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,810
leadership it's scaring my positions

346
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:10,448
because they get that right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate that</font>

347
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenario out they get it and we are</font>

00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:18,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">making huge investments to fix this</font>

349
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:21,030
problem so what do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I know</font>

350
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:24,790
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are probably thinking</font>

351
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:26,020
bullshit we are information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

352
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,600
people we hear about confidentiality

353
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:33,820
integrity availability I have a cissp on

354
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:35,889
my wall that says so I know this because

355
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">I interview people for positions on my</font>

356
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:42,970
team who essentially tell me that none

357
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:45,700
of them worked for me right what I'm

358
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:48,460
saying is that some of these people want

359
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be the cyber ninja they want to be</font>

the friendly<font color="#E5E5E5"> superhero they want to be</font>

361
00:17:50,890 --> 00:18:01,600
the iconoclast and they can't imagine

00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:06,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">themselves in any other role the</font>

363
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:09,159
challenge is they're wrong the days of

364
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:13,330
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a successful career</font>

their money their staff and their

373
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,899
ability to run our organizations

374
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,740
effectively because I would be dressed

375
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,090
if you should have a look at the way

376
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,460
this conference got organized

377
00:18:51,090 --> 00:19:00,570
information security people should not

378
00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:06,110
run organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay seriously so you</font>

do you keep trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a cyber ninja</font>

381

able to talk to muggles in ways they

386
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:29,250
understand and help them now my hope is

387

<font color="#E5E5E5">table a lot of my peers have a seat of</font>

398
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,100
the table unfortunately too many of my

399
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:08,910
peers have no idea what the flippity do

400
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:12,120
with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're still</font>

401
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:18,320
in super hear about or worse their

402
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:21,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">counter class okay this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is me if this</font>

403
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,429
resonates with you I would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

404
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:26,400
with you more about it more importantly

405
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,800
if this doesn't resonate with you I want

406
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know who you are now if I ever see</font>

407
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,800
you posted on John

408
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:36,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can simply move it to the other side</font>

409
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:39,950
because this is the path of information

410
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:43,490
security home forwarding it really is we

411
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,980
can't be what we've been to the outside

412
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,830
world now internally we are a messed-up

413
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:52,010
family right and I wouldn't have it any

414
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:54,320
other way right but when we start

415
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,720
talking with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people out there we</font>

416
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,230
have to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them differently so with</font>

417
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,460
that thanks very much we have a little

418
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of questions</font>

419
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:20,380
I so I joined I joined<font color="#E5E5E5"> Northside about</font>

420
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,490
10 miles ago before<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I spent three</font>

and a half years at wellstar health

425
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,770
that's one of things you have to learn

426
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,159
is everyone's mission is different for

427
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:38,139
Gil i'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrew and Phil right</font>

428
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,590

industry and the business mission is

430
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:46,149
different than mine but knowing the two

431
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,520
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're aligning themselves with</font>

the mission of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business that's what</font>

433
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:57,960
you have to do there's another question

434
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:57,959
over here and yes

435
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,540
but you're you're on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone with help</font>

436
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,470
higher education right so there's sort

437
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,090
of its balance in healthcare week

438
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:26,670
between education<font color="#E5E5E5"> right quality</font>

439
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:30,399
education and spirit across the cap oh I

440
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:32,590
only know one person has it worse and he

441
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,290
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> C so for emery so he's got the</font>

442
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">university and he's got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hospital</font>

443
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:43,480
yeah so again the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> time at the end</font>

444
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the institution</font>

445
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,040
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at what their goals</font>

446
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:51,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> values are right and you have to map</font>

447
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,230
what you're doing to that and if you're

448
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,199
and if your top two three missions don't

449
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:59,140
exactly near the organization's you're

450
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,460
just you're disconnected right and

451
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,790
you'll never<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to get the</font>

452
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,470
credibility of attraction in the

453
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:08,590
collaboration you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need want and</font>

454
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:11,110
deserve yes sir when terms of medical

455
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,959
being a regulated professional medical

456
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:19,959
side and<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have a regulation do you</font>

457
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:24,220
find that so let's top so questions

458
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,250
right a bit though<font color="#E5E5E5"> well not regulated as</font>

459
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,570
you get so here's a challenge most of

460
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,120
the regulations to health care to go

461
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:35,649
toward the privacy confidentiality of

462
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:40,840
data points and most healthcare

463
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:43,810
providers I think are doing a horribly

464
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,250
reasonable job the challenge is the

465
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:49,450
thing that I'm most worried about in

466
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:53,059
biomedical is regulated by the FDA the

467
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:56,559
FDA's drive for a

468
00:23:53,059 --> 00:24:00,830
places<font color="#CCCCCC"> to marry recently was efficacy</font>

469
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,690
does the device work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> India sterile</font>

470
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:07,189
environment can you guarantee it will

471
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:09,100
hurt somebody and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why yes well</font>

472
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:18,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">hospital environments are not sterile</font>

473
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:20,480
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even he is past the challenge and</font>

474
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,629
the FDA is working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the National</font>

475
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:28,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">authorized that joining them working</font>

476
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:28,119
group to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we harden</font>

477
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,460
problem is there are literally millions

478
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:37,460
of them in place right now that can't be

479
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,320
upgraded can't be patched they cost

480
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally trillions of dollars to</font>

481
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,939
replace and most your community health

482
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:46,369
care providers do not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial</font>

483
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,960
wherewithal even if new heart of ice

484
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:49,490
that were available that could afford a

485
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,499
replacement<font color="#E5E5E5"> I meant more like from the</font>

00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Magnetic respect though they beginning</font>

side are they being the top doctors

489
00:24:56,149 --> 00:25:01,758
about the importance of the spidery I'm

490
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:03,710
sorry listeners to the question yes

491
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,570
those conversations up so the questions

492
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:10,610
the conversations<font color="#CCCCCC"> are happening with</font>

493
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:14,119
physician leadership in my world we

494
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,830
talked with positional years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

495
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:18,918
explaining them what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

496
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,350
physicians or it is naturally more tuned

497
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,860
to technology and they get

498
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:26,350
interested in it some of them don't it's

499
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:29,229
like any organization where they

500
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:31,270
generally all get concerned is there are

501
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,799
certain aspects of compliance where

502
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:36,309
physicians are held individually and

503
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:41,429
severally liable understanding of the

504
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:41,428
malfunctioning of a device<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

505
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:01,450
not right now pleasures with the XP

506
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,910
service pack 1 embedded devices can we

507
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,950
share what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing no we have NDA's</font>

508
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,680
in place with a couple of people but my

509
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:12,400
goal is to by the end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year be</font>

510
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:19,390
able to actually publish something other

511
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:24,670
questions sir leadership role imagine

512
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:26,140

513
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:28,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys know that XP service pack 1</font>

514
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:32,620
embedded is still supported by microsoft

515
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:36,750
you can still buy stuff with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah</font>

516
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:39,959
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> sweat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it it has a 15-year</font>

517
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,960
appreciations head

518
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,059
so the overall I think the way in the

519
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">end we come here we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

520
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:52,770
much like<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk with Tom</font>

521
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,059
Wilson this team from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Southern</font>

522
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,830
Company the way that they're protecting

523
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,870
the SCADA systems and the nuclear plants

524
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:01,139
is you essentially create a separate

525
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:03,750
control network that is completely

526
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,940
access control as secure as you can

527
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,070
possibly make it that's where all those

528
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,690
devices live they have an administrative

529
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,100
network for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of it end of day</font>

530
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,470
that's how things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are having to work</font>

531
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,830
with us because we just can't replace

532
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:22,770
all these devices other questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

533
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:26,809
fantastic thinking all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so what I</font>

534
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:31,559
want to do Chris you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFP results</font>

535
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:33,750

536
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:35,389

538
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,390
so
