1
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:29,890
this room is frightening I I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font>

2
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably get nervous and stomach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stammer</font>

3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:36,450
a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but hopefully you'll take that in</font>

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:39,489
stride so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get started I</font>

5
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,000
actually gave this presentation some of

6
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:44,559
it at an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISS a conference this last fall</font>

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,750
and there were all<font color="#CCCCCC"> three people in the</font>

8
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,070
room that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was unfortunate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was</font>

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there was a lot of other</font>

10
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,730
exciting presentations going on so

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,080
there's one benefit from having a single

12
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,269
track and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,739
any options your captive audience other

14
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:59,080
than you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if the beer shows up and</font>

15
00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:02,559
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all leave I'll know it's frightening</font>

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,989
Lee boring but yeah so I actually

17
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,460
started off my career in chemical

18
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,409
engineering and that didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work out so</font>

19
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:12,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I went back to music and eventually</font>

20
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:15,070
became computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> scientist so it's been a</font>

21
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,280
long crazy Road a number of roles that

22
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:21,100
I've had there but my present role is

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,530
the threat intelligence manager at a

24
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,929
fortune<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 insurance company who I will</font>

25
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:30,609
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> name by name because they have not</font>

26
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:33,430
cleared this talk so my management has

27
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:34,899
but we have as you might imagine in a

28
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,149
large organization of that nature and

29
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:40,030
we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that more as presentation</font>

30
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:42,520
proceeds a lot of legacy controls

31
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,899
especially around what you can and

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,450
cannot say and what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and cannot</font>

33
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:50,560
share and what you cannot publish and so

34
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,789
there's a very selective set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,130
that i can say with the fictional

36
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:57,670
official sanction so to give me more

37
00:01:54,130 --> 00:02:00,280
leverage and more freedom of speech will

38
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,659
just not involve thin directly so most

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,979
of my experiences<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i'm talking about</font>

40
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:05,829
actually to come out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work</font>

41
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:11,100
environment so you may or may not find

42
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:11,100
how many work for well how many work

43
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:17,420
and probably I'm guessing probably for

44
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:20,120
medium and small sized businesses and

45
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:23,358
maybe a handful of large corporations so

46
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,629
your your experiences will vary quite

47
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:28,489
widely of course there is speaking of

48
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:31,420
varying widely a lot of dissension about

49
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:33,829
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually threat intelligence so</font>

50
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,290
this definition actually comes from

51
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:37,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">gardner and seems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a popular one at</font>

52
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,219
least in some of the marketing press

53
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,869
that you find it's not not a bad one to

54
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:44,329
work with but basically we're looking

55
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">for evidence of compromise or indicators</font>

56
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:48,620
of compromise or things that might tell

57
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,780
us that bad things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and we</font>

58
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,849
want to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in an informed way with</font>

59
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,950
context that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to apply it to</font>

60
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,689
our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> business environments and not</font>

61
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,849
only that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at some point</font>

62
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:01,069
be able to leverage that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information to</font>

63
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:02,599
give us a predictive capability so

64
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:04,280
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of expectations that are</font>

65
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,629
coming associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with threat</font>

66
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,849
intelligence and what we do with that

67
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:12,649
that's probably difficult to read why do

68
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:15,018
we really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to touch upon some of</font>

69
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,239
that now but we really want early

70
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,970
warnings so that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an adaptive</font>

71
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,739
response and we can make more effective

72
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,659
incident response but not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> instant</font>

73
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:25,760
response but in many organizations what

74
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:27,978
we find in were actually reacted we're

75
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,840
not really setting up response but just

76
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:32,569
day-to-day reaction from a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

77
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,489
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going on even with groups that</font>

78
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,750
are mature in other aspects of their

79
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:37,459
security infrastructure or their

80
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,069
enterprise security architectures

81
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:43,609
incident response in my experience has

82
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:46,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">been a relatively weak area but that</font>

83
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">again based on my actual experiences</font>

84
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,879
different companies I've worked for have

85
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,978
had really mature ins and response

86
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,608
capabilities others not so mature it

87
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:57,650
really is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of all over the map this</font>

88
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:59,479
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> adaptive response is I think</font>

89
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,519
important because what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really want to</font>

90
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:04,159
eventually get to is not just incident

91
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,319
response but a continual adaptive

92
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,179
response so there really isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ebb</font>

93
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,668
and flow between actual fires that are

94
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,000
occurring but just<font color="#CCCCCC"> day-to-day handling</font>

95
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:15,349
of what is normal business I think part

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,899
of the mantra that we've we've heard

97
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:18,579
recently and we see it more in the news

98
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,688
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're more</font>

99
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,579
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are being breached in the</font>

100
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:24,039
day-to-day basis establishing an

101
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:26,280
expectation at the board level that we

102
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:29,318
will be hacked packing as an inevitable

103
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">occurrence and you should simply be</font>

104
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:34,590
prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond to that in some</font>

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,419
fashion that's a paradigm shift

106
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,068
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially at board level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at executive</font>

107
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:42,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">level management in companies because</font>

108
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:44,139
until recent times that the strategy has

109
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,490
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> floss avoid being hacked all</font>

110
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,530
together and if you did get packed and

111
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,120
that's your it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the pink slip</font>

112
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,169
of a seesaw it's time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get him</font>

113
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,120
marching out the door and bring it

114
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,620
another regime who basically goes

115
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,219
through the same exercise in another six

116
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twelve months and I think as large</font>

117
00:04:57,219 --> 00:05:01,389
breaches occur or frequent basis fewer

118
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,370
fewer CISOs are going to lose their<font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

119
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,719
as a result just a personal thing and

120
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:10,229
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a good thing because you</font>

121
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:12,279
really need continuity at that level<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

122
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:14,050
driving better<font color="#CCCCCC"> more effective or</font>

123
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:17,039
incident response<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's time very closely</font>

124
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,039
to insert a response

125
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,100
I almost have to start this talk with

126
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,560
venting and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my venting slide</font>

127
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,390
what if what have I had you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know years</font>

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,890
of years of<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to black out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Def</font>

129
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Con and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my justifications for going</font>

130
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,870
where maintain situational threat and

131
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,010
awareness what's going on what are one

132
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,470
of the bad guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

133
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:42,000
defend against or as a pen tester what

134
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:46,040
did one of the key areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

135
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,440
be focused on to keep my skills sharp so

136
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,360
problem is executives and management

137
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,060
didn't always get on board with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> RT</font>

138
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,620
great day okay oh you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to vegas</font>

139
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,080
the party and what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

140
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,580
learn out there you know or you're

141
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're just hanging out with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font>

142
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys that just like a drink all the time</font>

143
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,180
well yeah it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> crews do that but</font>

144
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,980
but there really is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of value to be</font>

145
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,250
gained from these these community-based

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:14,340
sharing exercises and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think finally</font>

147

<font color="#CCCCCC">find what we're seeing staff and or at</font>

148
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,190
least in my personal experience of

149
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,200
seeing executive management that's

150
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:25,140
getting on board with that and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

151
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,700
in no small part to regime change so the

152
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,289
old guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are retiring and leaving and</font>

153
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,650
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> bringing new people who have the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">right threat that our defensive level of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">CISOs are starting to go away the</font>

through that we have some more

160
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,450
psychoanalysis sessions maybe we can

161
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,360
admit but you know we have issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

162
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,640
start 12-step program leave our hacker

163
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,320
sort of history behind at least for a

164
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:00,110
bit and put on a clean white shirt when

165
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:04,860
we go to work instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> black one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

166
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:07,320
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the paradigm shift now</font>

167
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,710
beyond just mindset is getting budget

168
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,260
and that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least in my current</font>

169
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation getting money to stand up a</font>

170
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:21,150
program is a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and part of that is</font>

171
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,380
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have to show the financial</font>

172
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,489
justification what are you going to

173
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,960
deliver as a threat intelligence

174
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,810
program that the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> will find</font>

175
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,310
useful show what the expenses are going

176
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,599
to be and you've got some clear expenses

177
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,000
that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start coming out of</font>

178
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,500
once you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the</font>

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">architecture of how you implement threat</font>

180
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,360
intelligence so their costs are going to

181
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,250
be associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with people with</font>

182
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,479
implementing processes that have to

183
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,750
integrate with existing business

184
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:49,000
workflows and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

185
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically baseline project costs because</font>

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,599
you have to have these internal projects

187
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,799
to integrate your existing business into

188
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,900
what you plan to do is a threat

189
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,539
intelligence group or person within a

190
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,039
within your company's so these these are

191
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:01,840
hidden costs that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may not have</font>

192
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,280
thought about but they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there</font>

193
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,690
and you have to still make the

194
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,568
justification in terms of people time

195
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:11,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">through executives that as you try to</font>

196
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:13,990
implement these programs yeah not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

197
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:16,120
a dedicated team as a real problem and

198
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,610
for me being<font color="#E5E5E5"> that guy who came in</font>

199
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,110
wearing a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hats being the token</font>

200
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,720
hacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was brought into the larger</font>

201
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,340
security group and being for a while the

202
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,550
sole enterprise architect for the

203
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,750
company for security architecture when I

204
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,130
was then given the role of being the

205
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,780
threat intelligence manager I didn't

206
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,779
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to put those own roles aside</font>

207
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,669
right so basically had well keep

208
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,620
shifting the hat all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

209
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,328
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a problem when you're still</font>

210
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,669
your task with actually doing threat

211
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:45,790
intelligence collection and analysis and

212
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,589
doing reporting but also writing program

213
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,149
documents around that oh wait you still

214
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,910
our own all these other review boards

215
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:53,320
it's really just there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no time so the</font>

216
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,329
thing that you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably have to</font>

217
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,890
accept is you know that that 40 or 60

218
00:08:55,329 --> 00:09:02,260
hour work week now just became an 80 or

219
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:04,390
90 are<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah really at least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> locally yeah</font>

220
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">section well for some people maybe so</font>

221
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm reaching an age where it's</font>

222
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,490
challenging it really is so what

223
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">work-life balance its yeah forget about</font>

224
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,329
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least in my case it's a I think we</font>

225
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">will eventually want to get there</font>

226
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:19,510
because that I think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> important to</font>

227
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,950
maintain that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will start having</font>

228
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,990
burnout if you're not already burning

229
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,490
out you will be burning out the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

230
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,670
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

231
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:30,870
of this nature just<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> experience I'm</font>

232
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:32,969
worn out I've kept some slides in here

233
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,470
that I had previous talks and we'll just

234
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of breeze through those but really</font>

235
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's integrations that you need to do</font>

236
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,020
into your existing enterprise security

237
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,570
architectures and and if you haven't

238
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">done those architectures it's important</font>

239
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,260
that you take a step back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say am I</font>

240
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,819
really ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement a threat</font>

241
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,930
intelligence program because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

242
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:54,810
threat intelligence program is really

243
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">more of an advanced topic so if you</font>

244
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,529
hadn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> done the basics it's probably</font>

245
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,680
time to step<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluate where you</font>

246
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:03,390
are and your security program they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

247
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,969
what's left to do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when is the right</font>

248
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,850
time to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about plugging</font>

249
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:11,550
things in so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always find useful</font>

250
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:16,320
reference architectures<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my case we're</font>

251
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:18,089
basing hours on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISO 27001</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amendment</font>

252
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,040
framework most companies at least in

253
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:23,279
private sector are using something like

254
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,230
that if not that exactly we at the

255
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,760
moment are totally revamping our policy

256
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,890
sets and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a useful</font>

257
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,839
exercise as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well because when revisions</font>

258
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,449
come out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> IC 27 for example the most</font>

259
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,980
recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is 20 2013 you should take a</font>

260
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,450
hard look at your policy set and make

261
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,570
sure that it's actually aligned with

262
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:41,339
what the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> provision is has to say</font>

263
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,570
about your control set should examine

264
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,260
all your controls and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

265

<font color="#E5E5E5">those are well implemented I the one</font>

267
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,350
is this is ms model of plan do check act

268
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:58,170
cycle and that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> does apply</font>

269
00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:00,540
directly to not just is ms and your risk

270
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,099
management framework but it's also a key

271
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,569
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion when we talk</font>

272
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,790
about threat intelligence and how you

273
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,950
actually implement that so just

274
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,920
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaking remember the OODA</font>

275
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:14,640
loop without saying where<font color="#CCCCCC"> huda came from</font>

276
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,310
but breaking that down what to establish

277
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,050
your your plans and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those</font>

278
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,839
are well formulated you have an

279
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:23,040
implementation plan for operations kind

280
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what we're here to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

threatened

282
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,130
let's monitor and review that so you

283
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,510
have a governance layer to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

284
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,970
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting your key objectives that</font>

285
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,130
you have key<font color="#CCCCCC"> manage i key performance</font>

286
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,350
indicators find and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is also</font>

287
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,270
important that you want achievable

288
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,150
results that you communicate to your

289
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:43,120
management team and they are in inline

290
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,319
unlock on board with that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

291
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,750
going up front you don't want to just

292
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">run your shop as an ad-hoc shop or</font>

293
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,310
you'll continuously be in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad hoc mode</font>

294
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,520
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course act maintain and improve</font>

295
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,829
and optimize your workflows and there's

296
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,130
some legacy stuff here this is a

297
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:02,560
comprehensive slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found of the ISS</font>

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,410
what we're here to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

300
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,420
process flow is not quite that

301
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,860
complicated but it breaks down in a

302
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,630
similar fashion and you really probably

303
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,220
do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend time documenting your</font>

304
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:16,210
process flow as part of programming

305
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:18,640
documentation that will get you a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

306
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:21,279
traction with executive management at

307
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,960
least in large organizations it's

308
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,790
actually a key part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I find</font>

309
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,350
myself doing as a threat intelligence

310
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,560
manager I spend more time documenting

311
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:32,620
process clothes than I do doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

312
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,750
intelligence so it's kind of sad that

313
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:38,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that all the corporate management</font>

314
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,870
overhead again the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> looped just</font>

315
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,220
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of formulating that it's</font>

316
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,140
interesting to me that this that this

317
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,570
presentation actually integrated threats

318
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,520
by the way this this set of content is

319
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">not my own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you want the actual</font>

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">lengths to to these slides so be happy</font>

321
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,860
to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the deck then also the</font>

322
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,070
references for her all the content is

323
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,980
taken from so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's important to</font>

324
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:02,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">work off the shoulders of others and</font>

325
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,760
elevate ourselves which is another way

326
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,980
of saying it's quite girls like heck<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

327
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,780
steal your<font color="#E5E5E5"> content but give credit to</font>

328
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,310
those who actually did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

329
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want the same thing done</font>

330
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,000
to us when we actually get around

331
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,530
designing new and creative content

332
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">writing it's that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important to give</font>

333
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,280
attribution so I do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that all</font>

334
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,550
they interviewed about all that all the

335
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,620
citations if and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want those</font>

336
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,900
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is interesting to me this idea</font>

337
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of developing a purity score card this</font>

338
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">is actually also correlated with the</font>

339
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,349
NIST cybersecurity framework the idea of

340
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,330
profile and showing what your target

341
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,150
profile is so not every company should

be at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same maturity level either in</font>

obviously going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start out at a less</font>

you can say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> at six months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from now</font>

350
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,569
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing these activities and</font>

351
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,060
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the staff to support that</font>

your budget cycle discussions which I'm

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">still involved here here I've captured a</font>

357
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,060
handful of presentations material on

<font color="#CCCCCC">through a planning & directions days</font>

363
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,950
we're going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially collection</font>

364
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,470
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about collecting indicators</font>

365
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:33,650
to compromise but also specific threat

366
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,990
Intel about actors and we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

367
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">through a process and exploitation phase</font>

368
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,970
of our analysis this is where we're

369
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,830
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the potential impact and</font>

relevance to our own infrastructure of

00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:48,080
threats and vulnerabilities so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

372
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:52,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to mention that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

an easy often it's it's a frequent thing

374
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,990
that I've seen occur in its I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

375
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,610
guilty of it and my own<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization is</font>

376
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,470
to conflate the terms threat and

377
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,850
vulnerability when it comes to the types

378
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,490
of reports that i'm generating<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">terminal for my management team as often</font>

380
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,570
is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really writing a</font>

381
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,770
vulnerability report with some specific

382
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,930
information added to that about

383
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,630
potential threat actors because it's not

384
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:19,099
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case that we know or are</font>

385
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:20,960
able to attribute observed attempts to

386
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,810
hack into our infrastructure to the

387
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:26,530
actual actors so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example who all</font>

388
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,060
really believes that china is behind son

389
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,589
well we've seen attribution like that

390
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,888
but do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really believe it not if you</font>

391
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:32,089
don't

392
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,859
always even have that level of

393
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:35,089
attribution where we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something from</font>

394
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:36,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">the government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that says it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this that</font>

foot after a bath right<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we hire</font>

396
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:40,339
mandiant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the answer is always China</font>

397
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:43,128
right so it depends on who you're

398
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:45,410
talking to and who's giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that</font>

399
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:49,220
type of attribution advice who the

400
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:51,049
threat actor is or maybe we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

401
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,299
really always they get even that level

402
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:55,040
of detail depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on who you're</font>

403
00:15:53,299 --> 00:16:04,579
working with you may or may not get

404
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:07,069
detailed attribution information yes yes

405
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:08,748
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely we get into threat risk</font>

406
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:11,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">assessment in just a bit but that that's</font>

407
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:14,149
an important aspect as well so as part

408
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:15,470
of the cycle we're collecting specific

409
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:18,619
threat information but we're also going

410
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,879
to cycle<font color="#CCCCCC"> through how we mature that that</font>

411
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:24,589
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how we do risk</font>

412
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:26,419
assessment and then once we've done an

413
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:28,609
analysis step there's obviously delivery

414
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,769
or dissemination but the key the key

it as a hobby the planning and

00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,749
directions phase is always an

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,270
dash 39 so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> think in the same</font>

434
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,800
approach and then showing that you need

435
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,050
to do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> cycle but across multiple</font>

436
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,819
tiers of your organization so basically

437
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,698
it's what we were saying as we started

438
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:29,310
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk you're going to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the is ms</font>

439
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,810
loop the same at the framework level you

440
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do a risk assessment at an</font>

enterprise level you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do risk</font>

442
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,909
assessment that application level but

443
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,629
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're following the same</font>

444
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:41,880
workflow throughout there is a tendency

445
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,560
to view threat intelligence and try to

446
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,810
say that applies only to my technical

447
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,210
assets but there's also the need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

448
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:50,040
threat intelligence analysis around<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

449
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,510
are the threats to personnel what are

450
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,740
the threats to physical facility what

451
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:58,560
are the threats to key executives all

452
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,960
those threats<font color="#CCCCCC"> locally-based do we do a</font>

453
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,419
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis so if we're looking</font>

454
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,490
at international traffic for example but

455
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,230
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the scope want your team does</font>

456
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,820
depends on the size of your of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

457
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,190
organization the size the specific

requirements of your management team and

459
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:19,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">in my case our focus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the moment is IT</font>

460
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:19,460
and technical asset threat so

461
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:28,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh how many times can you see the same</font>

462
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:30,950
workflow again from SP 830 more ooda

463
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,210
loop really you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never get out of</font>

464
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the loop you're stuck in a ridiculous</font>

465
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:37,670
cycle that never ends this is the job

466
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,350
you've asked for it's like a swirling

467
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:42,680
cesspool of you never get<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped</font>

468
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:46,610
processing threat what's the exit

469
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,590
strategy well hopefully hopefully you're

470
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,139
managing threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like this slide</font>

this this is from blanco blanco I think

<font color="#CCCCCC">that's our objective so this this is</font>

476
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,200
something from way back labs who are a

480
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:24,680
financial sector vertical so we are

number of emphasize sac and one of the

482
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,370
which is I think the premier and threat

483
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,970
information sharing organization or

484
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:33,500
amongst<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sex at least and as such we</font>

485
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,180
get a lot of exposure to<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat</font>

intelligence coming from organizations

487

we also get subscribed information from

way back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of other companies</font>

492
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:55,160
supplies but the whole point here is is

493
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:57,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">to increase your process maturity and</font>

of what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing if you're</font>

performing your manager it's defined

502
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,920
out and that gives you kind of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> action</font>

503
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:21,020
plan or moving your

504
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:22,430
program forward so in my case this is a

505
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,340
case study that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put together around</font>

506
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:27,140
fictitious company where you're

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,959
basically starting up a program<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

508
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:33,080
started buying by actually describing

509

the team does and making that

510
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,889
information available as part of a

511
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,530

<font color="#E5E5E5">real-life company are completely</font>

514
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:48,139
accidental but there there may be some

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:51,080
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important thing to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">begin with as you're developing a threat</font>

517
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,840
intelligence program is to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that you have executive men</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> date for the</font>

trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement process the process</font>

524
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:09,409
is difficult enough as it is to get

established<font color="#E5E5E5"> in large organizations where</font>

there is a legacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is the way you</font>

00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,760
do things we're not changing it just

528
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:20,179
because you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a great idea</font>

529
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:22,100
we're over<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we run a lean shop we</font>

530
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">have as few technical people as possible</font>

531
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,870
so the new things you're asking us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

532
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:28,490
are going to be assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lowest low</font>

533
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:32,510
priority because these people are

534
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:34,310
already working on what are deemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,770
business critical roles and

responsibilities your thing if it's not

537
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">being business critical and given</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

538
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,500
criticality by your top level executive

539
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,270
it's just going to be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

540
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,610
gets put on the shelf and never gets

541
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,560
implemented and even if you do have

542
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,740
executive approval that may still also

543
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a risk area so that's that's</font>

544
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,690
certainly important defining your scope

545
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,220
in terms of what types of threats are

546
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,830
you going to be focused on initially you

547
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,470
don't want to set<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large a larger scope</font>

548
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,419
and you can hope to achieve working just

549
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,980
with your technical assets or your

550
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,820
critical applications it's probably a

551
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,820
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

552
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:19,669
you should avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> conflating threat and</font>

553
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:20,870
risk and more than vulnerability but you

554
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:22,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the same time make sure that</font>

555
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,110
those terms are clearly understood by

556
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,370
everyone in your company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may be</font>

557
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,908
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> your presentations and</font>

558
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,928
understanding what you're delivering so

559
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:32,769
getting definition out of the way is

560
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:35,809
relatively important in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> program and</font>

vulnerability you have any questions

<font color="#E5E5E5">about that now so we're basically</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">looking to the potential source for</font>

possibly see patterns of attacks that

remediating actions as simple as

blocking their source IPS but it may be

575
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">more complicated by identifying the</font>

00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:18,320
the type of attack that's occurring

00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:20,210
recognize that sooner we can able to may

document we saw before of you'll find it

616
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,590
also in risk management discussions that

617
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:51,290
are framed around iso 27,000 the same

618
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,480
the same process but identify threats

619

sources identify vulnerabilities

620
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,620
determine likelihood of occurrence to a

621
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,170
magnitude of impact and and from that

622
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,179
come out with a risk score this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

a basically the day-to-day work of

628
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:23,060
integrations between incident response

629
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:24,650
and threat intelligence quite nicely so

630
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,950
above and beyond just delivering ports

631
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,600
to management we want to actually have a

632
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:32,390
close association with our incident

633
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">response team and actually implementing</font>

634
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,740
mitigations so that that's me is the

635
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:40,850
more operational aspect of threat

636
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:43,430
intelligence having an established see

637
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:46,219
Sir or assert within your company is an

638
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:47,810
ideal state to go into you may you may

639
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,970
have a company where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have such</font>

640
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,470
a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> established and you need to</font>

641
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:58,130
define some roles and responsibilities

642
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:59,740
there and keeping a store as a central

643
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,930
repository of<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat and tell</font>

644
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,820
information is useful because that it

645
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,680
gives you the opportunities and<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

646
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,840
future point to apply automation and

647
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:12,560
we'll talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just a little bit</font>

648
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:15,439
and we've talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this already but</font>

649
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,750
basically we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add answer the six</font>

650
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,980
questions of

who wear one why what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and we</font>

652
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:27,490
have beaten this to death you should be

653
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,650
able to speak in terms of threat

654
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,900
assessment levels when we speak the

655
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:34,390
management color coding is actually

656
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,310
somewhat useful but you need to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

657
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:38,620
quantitative method of arriving<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that</font>

658
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,990
so you consistently apply the same

659
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,489
methodology of assessing<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk so even if</font>

660
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're doing qualitative risk assessment</font>

661
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,450
at some point you should think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

662
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">assigning some number level to the</font>

663
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,520
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're evaluating</font>

664
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,200
but you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it that by generally</font>

665
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,600
speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are they what's the</font>

666
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,540
exposure<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what's the severity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

667
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,219
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the severity and</font>

668
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:05,170
exposure then allow you to compute<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

669
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:06,730
impact value so what would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage</font>

670
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,110
to my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows environment if none of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">those systems are exposed to the</font>

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and I'm getting attacks that</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact of my enterprise would be low</font>

675
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:19,330
because i have no exposure so it is

676
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">important to maintain some situational</font>

677
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,780
awareness about how you're running your

678
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,970
firewalls and how what your overall

679
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,470
posture is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of exactly where the</font>

680
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,990
attacks are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from it's also</font>

681
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,070
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your internal just</font>

682
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,130
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from a network perspective</font>

683
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:35,230
to consider your internal attacks and

684
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:39,070
not to consider your internal network as

685
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:41,640
being a protected<font color="#CCCCCC"> Citadel because as you</font>

686
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:44,110
may know probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> this audience that</font>

687
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,240
oftentimes malware attacks give a

688
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,429
foothold on your internal network to an

689
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,050
external attacker who then has as much

690
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:53,760
visibility into your internal network as

691
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:57,120
we did with or without your Fargo so

692
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,040
that's that's common knowledge I think

693
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,409
but for management<font color="#E5E5E5"> reports colors are</font>

694
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,120
meaningful especially at the board level

695
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,830
so if you can translate<font color="#E5E5E5"> your threat</font>

696
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,389
assessment into a color-coded for

697
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,879
assessment level this is really

698
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">beneficial to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

699
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,110
you to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to management in</font>

700
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,379
terms that they understand so you need

701
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a consistent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way of applying</font>

702
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,010
vulnerability analysis and identify

00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:24,390
potential threat actors and

704
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:28,260
communicating that up the hill<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

705
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:30,150
think maybe you know what you the basics

00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what you're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at but we want to</font>

707
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">know who the audience for our our threat</font>

708
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,350
discussion is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the severity and</font>

709
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,090
urgency is one of the biggest questions

710
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:44,280
that comes to me all the time is ok so

711
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:46,260
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this freak attack what about</font>

712
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,770
this freak volatility what is my what is

713
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,480
my my priority on pageant should should

714
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I should I interrupt all of my work</font>

715
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,380
clothes and do an emergency patch

716
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,430
process well then we're just strictly

717
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,870
talk of overbilling because there

718
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,990
haven't been any identifying attackers

719
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,850
this weakness haven't been any observed

720
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:05,340
attacks really but it's improved<font color="#CCCCCC"> concept</font>

721

wild not a lot of active attacks against

you completely different<font color="#CCCCCC"> department of</font>

724
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,750
course the moment that went publicly

00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:15,390
started seeing scanning for which turned

726
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,010
into real attacks against it so that it

727
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,690
was obviously a much greater urgency

728
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,670
when you see things that are live<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

729
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,800
wild then there is when you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

730
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,330
any type of attack but that's the my

00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,310
internal audience for reports that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,169
delivering our technical team as much as

to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what's the criticality how</font>

how how how quickly should I better<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

739
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:43,949
process and do this as an emergency

740
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:48,210
patch in my environment we have a very

00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:50,300
strong change control group<font color="#CCCCCC"> and paradigm</font>

742
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:54,420
and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do anything without</font>

executive approval if for for emergency

744
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,620
changes so if you have a large

with multiple presidential level

747
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:08,960
approvals is a non-trivial task and you

748
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to justify that accordingly</font>

749
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,810
there's some just a little bit about

750
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:20,160
profiling attack a threat actors that I

751
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:22,560
kept here this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a presentation on</font>

752
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:28,350
I forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who actually did it</font>

753
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:29,879
but it's through a media chair but

754
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,169
that's this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that we</font>

00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,960
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't it was worth mentioning</font>

757
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:37,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">some content that just came out this</font>

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,480
Diplomatic Security and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a new report</font>

762
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,910
that they released just this week had to

763
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,250
do with identifying cyber threat /

764
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:56,370
country so they have a methodology

765
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,840
that's that's really well described it

766
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,540
lines up well what we're talking about

767
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,760
how you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat attacked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

768
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,409
threat assessments but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you can</font>

769
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,790
see the computation of risk is exactly

770
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,100
what I showed on one of the previous

771
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides it's it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three to hold based</font>

772
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,750
on the threat threat vulnerability and

773
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,520
impact so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a really</font>

774
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,080
common language you find especially in a

775
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,570
mist is using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there basically</font>

776
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,389
everyone so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also from the Oh sac</font>

777
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,649
document describing basically you want

778
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,380
to measure capability intent

779
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:27,710
vulnerability impact and there's some

780
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,820
materials that they provide that you can

781
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:32,220
if you want to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

782
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">nation-state basis what are what are the</font>

783
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,520
risk that I my company might see if I'm

784
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,280
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> business in this country or that</font>

785
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,660
country was was there one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

786
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,700
it's also useful to take the same

787
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,260
methodology and apply to what are the

788
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,810
threat actors in those nation states

789
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:49,170
that may be targeting me that

790
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:50,780
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought that some of the things</font>

791
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they that they mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

792
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:55,860
especially towards the bottom of this

793
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:57,480
we're interesting that they felt at risk

794
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,879
various / organization that threat

795
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,170
remains constant<font color="#E5E5E5"> per country I'm not</font>

796
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure I totally agree without the trip</font>

797
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:06,000
but capability remains constant for

798
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,610
country intent remains constant<font color="#CCCCCC"> per</font>

799
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,440
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a really broad view</font>

800
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:12,689
about that i think in very large

801
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,970
countries that's that's that's maybe not

802
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:17,190
so true I don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would agree</font>

803
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,330
that intent remains constant across the

804
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,950
United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> our example there are a</font>

805
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,080
lot of threat actors in the United

806
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">States of all sorts of different</font>

807
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,340
motivations that so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to</font>

808
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:31,940
me that this department of state takes

809
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,939
such a broad view of things nations

810
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:43,830
yeah I heard that<font color="#CCCCCC"> III think you're right</font>

811
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,780
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from that type of analysis</font>

812
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:48,360
but their presentation was more towards

813
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,940
what type of cyber risky do you incur by

814
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,620
actually being there in that state so

815
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,050
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I won't have executives</font>

816
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:57,689
that want to travel to or do business in

817
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,520
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> with computing technology and say</font>

818
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,140
they won't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to China that I should</font>

819
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,270
measure the impact of that against my

820
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment or if I'm doing this is in</font>

821
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,510
China what what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the impact as opposed</font>

822
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,880
to I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was really meant</font>

823
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:10,559
towards threat actors that are targeting

824
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,720
me coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the States but really</font>

825
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,540
more about the threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing business</font>

826
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,660
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> state and and maybe maybe that</font>

827
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:21,720
lens changes that view a bit but maybe

828
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:24,059
not I mean maybe maybe maybe look you

829
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,590
can look at it regardless of whether the

830
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:28,290
tech is coming to me from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

831
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:31,110
state as if that state actor versus the

832
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:33,030
cost of doing business there I don't

833
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,159
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it changes I think it's worth</font>

834
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:37,410
maybe doing the threat analysis from

835
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:41,280
with both lenses and seeing how the

836
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:44,280
quarterly net results which I haven't

837
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,020
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> so unfortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me my company</font>

838
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,820
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> focused domestic business so</font>

839
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,620
that's kind of not really the point of

840
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,700
the thought to me that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

841
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,649
methodology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and doing the risk</font>

842
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,690
assessment was the same and the tools

843
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:57,840
that they have provided through their

844
00:33:54,690 --> 00:34:01,890
their report which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also the URL is</font>

845
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,350
listed here<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh by the way it is the</font>

846
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,240
Department of State it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh sack bag of</font>

847
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,860
I have the URL sport but you actually

848
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to have a member of your</font>

849
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,190
organization established a presence with

850
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:14,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Department of State in order to gain</font>

851
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:16,200
access to that or you can gain access to

852
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:18,899
the report through FB i--<font color="#CCCCCC"> InfraGard was</font>

853
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:21,210
the channel i received so they

854
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:24,449
apparently are not just getting that out

855
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:27,300
to anybody everybody but there there is

856
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:30,750
I guess once it's out its out they'll

857
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,369
have a hard time keeping it hidden but

858
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,469
if you try to go directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

859
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:34,740
download URL you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

860
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:37,969
to

861
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:40,408
it that way unless you take those

862
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:41,730
registration steps which are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

863
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:45,869
bit more tightly controlled than just

864
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:48,210
regular any old place I you can't read

865
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:50,550
it but it's a list of basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

866
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:52,860
bibliography that you can have for me if

867
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want the slide deck and some similar</font>

868
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,669
references some of the materials that

869
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've mentioned here before now and some</font>

870
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:01,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">more there I think we need to talk about</font>

871
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,510
vulnerability management per se but you

872
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:06,570
know penetration testing is always fun

873
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:10,369
you want to talk pentesting kill chain

874
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10,369
kill chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> where does that get</font>

875
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:31,220
outside like as soon as I go I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

876
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,220
to explain

877
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:36,430
I don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone else</font>

878
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,460
yeah that's a very good point the point

879
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,780
that the statement was that we should

880
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,280
not just deliver a vulnerability

881
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,560
information outside of the team that's

882
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,020
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and remediating</font>

883
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,580
vulnerabilities and because you'll spend

884
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,160
more time explaining that than you do

885
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:58,950
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting work done and I agree</font>

886
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that so in my case we talked about</font>

887
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk management and luring the</font>

888
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,520
enterprise risk we want to provide a

889
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:07,799
composite enterprise risk score to the

890
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,300
everybody else so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that basically we</font>

891
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,660
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> open the kimono all the way</font>

892
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:16,170
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just give a dashboard view of what's</font>

893
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:18,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">enterprise miss today and we translate</font>

894
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:21,180
for example patch level to an

895
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:25,410
established risk them so if for example

896
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:27,690
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a flat line of vulnerability</font>

897
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,370
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our server environment because we</font>

898
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,350
haven't been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to patch those servers</font>

899
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:33,420
then just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that it's not</font>

900
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:35,190
trending downward but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> flat and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

901
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,440
going up is good enough for management

902
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,900
to see you know have we may have we

903
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,130
improved our overall risk posture but I

904
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,570
definitely agree you don't want to be

905
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,640
talking about number of bone

906
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:46,740
criticality of vulnerabilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

907
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,040
patched last month<font color="#E5E5E5"> that just has no</font>

908
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,040
traction

909
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,980
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

910
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:17,920
right trying to think if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had the</font>

911
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,570
particular sign question and it's not

912
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:26,109
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> before after all here but but yes</font>

913
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:31,480
yes we do I think we actually kind of

914
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:37,210
breeze past it so in the risk in that

915
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:39,550
risk framework we want to understand the

916
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,590
threats<font color="#E5E5E5"> and exploits and then also the</font>

917
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:44,849
vulnerabilities but that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

918
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">us some measure of adverse impact so</font>

919
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:53,410
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to back to this this where did I</font>

920
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,330
put it haha I probably missed I did miss

921
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:58,359
it there's the we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

922
00:37:55,330 --> 00:38:05,970
briefly but I didn't dwell on it but

923
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:05,970
there is sorry for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy's</font>

924
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:14,540
the short answer short answer is yes but

925
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's yeah okay I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spend some time</font>

926
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:19,370
here but but measuring exposure rating

927
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:22,190
and severity also there's an impact

928
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:24,040
score from from exposure which which I

929
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:27,890
well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I said that already exposure</font>

930
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,870
but depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exposure and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

931
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,430
the severity<font color="#E5E5E5"> of vulnerability basically</font>

932
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:34,540
is what we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> group gives</font>

933
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:38,509
you a risk score that if it's down<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

934
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:41,210
then then you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to map</font>

935
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:43,730
that up into<font color="#CCCCCC"> what red or orange when you</font>

936
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:45,350
present that outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your team</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

937
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,850
that's that's the whole point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

938
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:50,390
do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to map vulnerability and</font>

939
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:52,580
exposure to a residual risk value and we

940
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:56,480
want the residual risk to be lowered and

941
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:58,250
so showing<font color="#CCCCCC"> over time boring the residual</font>

942
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,380
risk is one of the key performance

943
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:03,370
indicators we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide to say here's</font>

944
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,900
the value of having our threat program

945
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:08,450
historically you were flat line we

946
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,370
implemented the threat program we drove

947
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,890
the risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> down with the residual is down</font>

948
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,660
so that in a dashboard view is exactly

949
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:16,370
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want the meter is to</font>

950
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:20,620
start going what would your side you

951
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:20,620
have this green trending towards green

952
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:28,040
so that's an important aspect know

953
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,900
there's there's basically two major

954
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,450
kinds of reports that my team delivers

955
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,950
today which i do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have examples of</font>

956
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:38,240
here because that's a little bit too

957
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:39,919
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> a work work product but we have we</font>

958
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,600
have daily weekly and detailed threat

959
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,970
reports that specifically address

960
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:47,299
vulnerabilities and threats per se and

961
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:50,589
are mostly given to technical teams as

962
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:53,000
ki as a key tool for them to drive

963
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:55,940
prioritization of mitigation efforts and

964
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,370
then the other report that we give is a

965
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,010
dashboard view that goes up the hill

966
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:03,020
which speaks towards threat<font color="#CCCCCC"> transit and</font>

967
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:05,180
one of the one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the primary topics</font>

968
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:08,120
that that we're seeing as top trending

969
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:11,180
trending threats and without having the

970
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">actual content here we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to do that</font>

971
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,319
today

972
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:17,059
across the enterprise vertical so we

973
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:19,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about trending threats across our</font>

974
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:20,869
vertical and one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we still</font>

975
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:23,299
have yet to implement in my team is

976
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:25,549
trending threats for our internal point

977
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:28,339
of view with the internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> endzone so I</font>

978
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:31,420
can't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the vertical today the</font>

979
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:34,729
top threats that you see on an almost

980
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:39,739
almost never changing basis or malware

981
00:40:34,729 --> 00:40:43,160
fishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> day dose so in financial sector</font>

982
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:49,239
there is a day<font color="#E5E5E5"> to day non-stop battle</font>

983

villain dire de risa<font color="#E5E5E5"> Padre cop que ellos</font>

984
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:55,220
haha it just whatever flavor of the

985
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,680
moment of malware that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being pushed</font>

986
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,569
out in being upgraded so so dire is like

987
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,660
the new zoo spot if you don't know what

988
00:40:59,569 --> 00:41:05,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's about and the challenge is well</font>

989
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:08,118
in my corporate environment I may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

990
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:11,150
lot of really solid foundational

991
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:12,950
controls around endpoint security I've

992
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:16,220
also got a user base that's not in the

<font color="#E5E5E5">corporate sector that you know you may</font>

00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,368
you may have some parallels to that if

00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,319
you come from education or other other

996
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:23,059
verticals where you've got people that

997

you have desktop controller on and

998
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:28,279
you've got that set of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there</font>

foundation and controls around max

1008

portable the fortune thing is there's

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of malware attacking max yet</font>

freak but you can't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pushed out</font>

1014
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:03,759
because the vendors your phone companies

1015
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,960
are not pushing out support for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1016
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,690
devices so you're going to have

1017
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,369
lingering vulnerabilities that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist the</font>

1018
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:11,619
lingering lingering threat landscape

1019
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:13,359
that you can do nothing about because

1020
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:15,010
it's outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your control the only</font>

1021
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,170
controls you're going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> our what</font>

1022
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:18,460
are my MIDI gating steps now I make sure

1023
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they're you ever allowed on my</font>

1024
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,580
corporate network and if you did allow

1025
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,250
them like six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago then you made a</font>

1026
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:27,549
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistake and for which you know</font>

1027
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:29,260
recovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe unbel-- so you may really</font>

1028
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:31,900
want seriously think about network

1029
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:35,260
segmentation if you haven't already so

1030
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:37,000
the whole kill chain thing for us when

1031
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:40,240
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing an incident response or</font>

1032
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
we're doing mitigation reports and we

1033
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,359
want to describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what controls</font>

1034
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,520
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a step in the kill chain so in</font>

1035
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:50,859
my reports<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm addressing filled chain</font>

1036
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,490
by by showing what mitigating steps are

1037
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:55,480
possible at different levels so that

1038
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can start to drive the</font>

1039
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,770
discussion towards let's do incident

1040
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:02,500
response as early as possible let's

1041
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:04,930
identify threat and actual taxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> only as</font>

1042
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:08,770
possible it helps to focus the

1043
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:10,390
discussion and so yeah it may it may

1044
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:13,440
sound like a buzz word that's overused

1045
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:15,790
but if you can find a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with</font>

1046
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,460
those aspects of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kill chain as</font>

1047
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,150
you're talking about mitigating

1048
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,540
responses or what you're talking about

1049
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:27,099
incident we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about Enterprise</font>

1050
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:28,540
controls and start to to structure your

1051
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:30,160
controls in such a way that they address

1052
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,960
specific parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kill chain you'll</font>

1053
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,730
find it more effective to communicate

1054
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:37,320
especially the management team about

1055
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,320
driving costs down

1056
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:46,150
and more right so actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1057
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">already mentioned patch management and</font>

1058
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:54,420
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about prioritization of</font>

1059
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:57,790
what you're doing their way sick<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

1060
00:43:54,420 --> 00:44:02,380
right so mapping this this is actually a

1061
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:05,890
set of points<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were taken from NIST</font>

1062
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:08,170
content it's not 830 it's it's a

1063
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,580
different one but they're they're

1064
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:11,980
strictly talking about information

1065
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:14,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">lifecycle but I think I was like it's</font>

1066
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:17,110
like cyber and threatens the new cyber

1067
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:20,260
is it a drinking game now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear the</font>

1068
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:23,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">word threat let's take a dream so put</font>

1069
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:25,150
threat in front of any sentence this

1070
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,400
this framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one that we're</font>

1071
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:31,230
actually actively using in my enterprise

1072
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:35,730
it's it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the from CMU the</font>

1073
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:37,750
software engineering Institute so that's

1074
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,700
something called the collections

1075
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:42,430
management Franklin and and it's broken

1076
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:45,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">down into three major maturity model</font>

1077
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:47,710
phases which you cannot read that but I

1078
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:50,950
have the source URL for you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1079
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:56,440
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a PDF i flattened that and</font>

1080
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:58,960
broken that down into basically program

1081
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:02,230
model that will will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be using internally</font>

1082
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,270
to more correctly identify stages of

1083
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:09,190
where we are in implementing the

1084
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:11,680
framework as we proceed over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next 36</font>

1085
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:14,260
12 months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll be able to talk to</font>

1086
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,210
management are you know we are at<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1087
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,190
desired state of an advanced threat

1088
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:20,350
Intel program<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leveraging the</font>

1089
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:22,420
collections framework and so by

1090
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:24,520
identifying these these milestones that

1091
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,620
map back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the framework it allows us</font>

1092
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">then to identify maturity model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

1093
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:32,440
and push push boring in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1094
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,750
those activities I am going to need

1095
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,910
additional staff technology and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1096
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:38,530
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need cooperation from other</font>

1097
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:42,580
parts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business that had so far</font>

1098
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:44,500
been slow to develop and that will come

1099
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:47,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">at a cost which we can start to identify</font>

1100
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,300
because we'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say who the</font>

1101
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:49,960
roles and responsibilities are in those

1102
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">groups that</font>

1103
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,290
interface with us and the type of work

1104
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:56,259
that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be doing to support us</font>

1105
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:58,779
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a major</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> component of my</font>

1106
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:03,520
program is wrapping around this

1107
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:06,190
framework I've also developed that into

1108
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,780
a maturity model by by just laying out

1109
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the activities</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high level</font>

1110
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:12,130
activities that are being done in the

1111
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:14,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">framework and showing a march towards</font>

1112
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:18,180
advanced or<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimized state so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1113
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:20,680
all my content my content but based on

1114
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:23,819
standing on see em I see em use

1115
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,839
shoulders they also have some detailed

1116
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:28,480
breakdown of what you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing</font>

1117
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:31,119
actually part to do your threat analysis

1118
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,849
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there come to is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think useful</font>

1119
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,010
in terms of divining actual procedures

1120
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:37,570
for your workforce to help them

1121
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:40,410
understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> should you be doing as</font>

1122
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:42,910
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your threat analysis activities</font>

1123
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:46,240
it's also useful to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and use that</font>

1124
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:47,529
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a review of methodology when you're</font>

1125
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,149
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at did you meet your key</font>

1126
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:51,400
performance objectives over the past

1127
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:53,710
year here's how well you did at this

1128
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,349
task of that task so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it also</font>

1129
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:58,089
helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to map threat anilyst roles and</font>

1130
00:46:56,349 --> 00:47:00,220
responsibilities but also to more

1131
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:04,690
clearly define them and give that

1132
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:06,310
information to HR so when looking to

1133
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:08,950
hire a<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat anilyst it's not always</font>

1134
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:10,599
easy to understand what the role and

1135
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:12,759
responsibility is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> because as</font>

1136
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:15,220
we said at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the start of the talk even</font>

1137
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:19,150
threat intelligence is portal fine so

1138
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:22,240
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a threat analyst role in my</font>

1139
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:23,500
company as opposed to the defense sector

1140
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,618
is going to be a completely different

1141
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:29,970
animal not hopefully not<font color="#CCCCCC"> too completely</font>

1142
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:32,680
different but it will vary greatly so

1143
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,330
establishing a dialogue with HR so they

1144
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,730
understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the volar responsibility</font>

1145
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">really is and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to vet the</font>

1146
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,720
various resumes they might get well if

1147
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,279
you've ever done hiring before for a

1148
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,868
large company but you get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

1149
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,420
resumes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you simply think are trash</font>

1150
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:47,890
people make up<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff or they'll send</font>

1151
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:50,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">your resumes thinking well my background</font>

1152
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,940
would make a great foundational

1153
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,180
background for the job<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have but</font>

1154
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font>

1155
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,990
no experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatsoever in what you're</font>

1156
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,700
looking to hire so you have to kind of

1157
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,890
sort through that and figure out you

1158
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you know I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like him and I</font>

1159
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:03,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">think he's actually right or you know</font>

1160
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:05,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">what that's a great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea everything but</font>

1161
00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:08,500
I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Train somebody</font>

1162
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:11,559
in this role I need them<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so it's a</font>

1163
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:13,000
real challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to look at resumes and</font>

1164
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:14,619
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you think it</font>

1165
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,900
really benefit the team but at the same

1166
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:18,099
time not disqualify someone because they

1167
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,230
simply don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thread into a</font>

1168
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:21,730
background finding some of the or the

1169
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:24,040
threading tilt background limits you

1170
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:26,190
pretty much to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> intelligence</font>

1171
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:29,140
community people coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of DoD then</font>

1172
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:31,200
folks who who who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is threatening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> till</font>

1173
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:33,578
may have been around counterterrorism or

1174
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,430
insider threat with behavioral analysis

1175
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:38,230
we all watched like you know those those

1176
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:40,779
TV programs what we think people are

1177
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:43,569
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but whether that applies in</font>

1178
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:48,309
the private sector directly is can be a

1179
00:48:43,569 --> 00:48:50,470
challenge so that's real world

1180
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:53,859
experience with building a threat Intel

1181
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:57,339
program oh my gosh you want to

1182
00:48:53,859 --> 00:48:58,630
prioritize risk we've been saying that

1183
00:48:57,339 --> 00:49:00,369
over and over and over again<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this</font>

1184
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:03,400
brain work here breaks it down into

1185
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:05,619
steps that are also mapped to<font color="#E5E5E5"> various</font>

1186
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,049
levels of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three maturity</font>

1187
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:11,799
levels so clearly you can't read that

1188
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and i find this this helpful in terms of</font>

1189
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:17,559
identifying clear markers for where we

1190
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">are and where we want to be as we</font>

1191
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:23,410
improve our program you also can treat

1192
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:26,200
that but that's my actual workflow that

1193
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:28,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">i established we are basically</font>

1194
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,419
developing swim lines around those swim

1195
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:34,598
lanes around those actual phases of

1196
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:36,369
threat Intel so we have planning phase

1197
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:38,349
or requirements analysis phase a

1198
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:40,650
collection<font color="#CCCCCC"> phase and analyze phase of</font>

1199
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:43,480
dissemination phase of map different

1200
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:47,079
tasks in each of those phases that we

1201
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:49,930
can measure so the input<font color="#E5E5E5"> and output to</font>

1202
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:52,359
those phases will have key performance

1203
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:54,339
measurements against them and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

1204
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:55,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some some indication</font>

1205
00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:57,980
to our management

1206
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,840
team of what kind of job are we doing

1207
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,220
operationally so having operational

1208
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,140
performance metrics<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think are</font>

1209
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:05,600
important when you establish a program

1210
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:07,910
because if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have them you'll</font>

1211
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,440
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> good visibility into what how well</font>

1212
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:11,930
are you running your program so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1213
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,420
always have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about the output</font>

1214
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:15,980
being the morn deliverable but also a

1215
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:19,340
day to day conversation with your

1216
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:21,350
managers how could a job am i doing yeah

1217
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to receive good good reports at</font>

1218
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:25,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it usually</font>

1219
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:26,540
has a direct impact on bonus and so I

1220
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:29,360
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important to structure your</font>

1221
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,890
program with measurable points in the

1222
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:35,300
program to allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deliver those</font>

1223
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:37,250
type of indicators this ties somewhat

1224
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,230
back to the framework in fact closely

1225
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:41,270
back to that framework so I'm able then

1226
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:43,610
to show as I'm improving maturity of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1227
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:46,520
program what where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> investments in</font>

1228
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:48,200
the program have started to pay off if I

1229
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,800
have a key performance indicator in one

1230
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:53,419
in one process box that lag even though

1231
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,800
we've invested there then you probably

1232
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:58,070
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a root cause analysis to see</font>

1233
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:00,250
why is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> whyever my investments paid</font>

1234
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">off</font>

1235
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:08,169
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're the end here threat until</font>

1236
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:10,180
sharing is a topic that that I think is

1237
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:14,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">really key to having an effective threat</font>

1238
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:16,750
Intel team so as part of the FSI<font color="#CCCCCC"> sac I'm</font>

1239
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:19,180
also part of the cyber Intel community

1240
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:20,880
there and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot threatened tell</font>

1241
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:24,160
sharing that goes on in that community

1242
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,230
mostly TTP about actual either malware

1243
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,720
attacks DDoS attacks or phishing attacks

1244
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:34,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">as being the main ones that we see</font>

1245
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:37,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">day-to-day that is a closed community</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become a member of if your</font>

00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:46,779
sector company and pays to be a member

1249
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:48,460
of FSI set which by the way is that

that are wrapped<font color="#E5E5E5"> around that basically</font>

1254
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,308
the critical infrastructure categories

overlap between those members and

emphasize sect members but also the

1271
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:42,220
advantage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being FSI sect because it's</font>

made up of financial sector companies

there are limitations on the type of

concerns about anti-competitive

1278
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:02,530
violation of Rico yes so so there are

00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,500
limitations and you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen</font>

1280
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:06,970
through the cybersecurity framework that

1281
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:09,430
was pushed out there as it's been

1282
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:11,230
ongoing discussions which came from NIST

1283
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:13,569
also with their been discussed uncle

1284
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:15,760
discussions also President Obama just

1285
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:18,880
recently pushed an executive order out

1286
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,350
that he's hoping to clear the way which

1287
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,840
still has not done because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is not</font>

1288
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:25,360
supporting legislation to enable sharing

1289
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,250
to be done most companies are reluctant

1290
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do more proactive sharing because of</font>

1291
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:32,770
concerns about liability and being sued

1292
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:35,259
or being brought to court for potential

1293
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:37,060
Rico violations so there there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

these these<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal limitations that are</font>

1295
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:40,720
preventing companies from sharing in my

1296
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:42,490
own case we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests to share</font>

1297
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,109
certain specific things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font>

1298
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:45,970
done internally to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our Office of General</font>

1299
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:48,400
Counsel and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're still awaiting a</font>

1300
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:50,200
finding or responses from our own

1301
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,970
lawyers as to whether we can share that

1302
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:54,819
more broadly even in these close

1303
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:56,890
communities so that's that's a fortunate

1304
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:58,240
I see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information coming from</font>

1305
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,710
other companies but I'm not able to

1306
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:07,060
share nearly as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I would like to</font>

1307
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think capability evolution is is this</font>

1308
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:13,240
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually from this document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SB 850</font>

1309
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:15,280
it's a document<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's actually in draft</font>

1310
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,439
it's not published yet and it targets

1311
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,270
information sharing specifically so if

1312
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,010
you have an interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in joining an</font>

1313
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:24,400
information sharing community you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1314
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:25,960
find some some ideas about information

1315
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">sharing best practices that are being</font>

1316
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:32,140
developed by nails

1317
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:35,170
and being discussed at a more global

1318
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:37,660
level but basically the whole idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1319
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:39,280
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sharing sharing gets you</font>

1320
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:42,850
a lot of value in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of being able to</font>

1321
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,070
identify threats at an earlier stage and

1322
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:46,630
there are additional ways you can break

1323
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:51,010
that down this is my own internal

1324
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:52,600
attempt to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one method</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that once</font>

1325
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:54,100
you start sharing what you'll find is to

1326
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,259
again you'll get more threat indicators

1327
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:58,360
than you can possibly manage as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a human</font>

1328
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,890
it's just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at your log data</font>

1329
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,390
you need a sim to do your log

1330
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:04,660
correlation you're not going to be able

1331
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:05,859
to do indicator correlation as a human

1332
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,359
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were going to get literally</font>

1333
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:10,120
thousands of thousands of thousands of

1334
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things as member the FSI sec I've</font>

1335
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,230
also been on the security automation

1336
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:15,610
working group and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically has led</font>

1337
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:18,040
to the development and eventually

1338
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:20,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">spinoff of a new company called sultra</font>

1339
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,210
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm only involved with that's</font>

1340
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,980
potential customer so I don't want to

1341
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:25,690
advertise them really per se but there

1342
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:28,000
must of their work product is available

1343
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:30,220
open source or at least openly available

1344
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
for download so what that product is is

1345
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:34,959
a tool called edge which implements them

1346
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,450
protocols that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed by mitre</font>

1347
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,250
to do information in threaten until

1348
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:43,350
sharing or indicators compliment sharing

1349
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:46,690
through protocols called sticks and taxi

1350
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:48,640
so once you implement edge then what you

1351
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:50,440
wind up are with with you want to have

1352
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,700
established<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeds through other threat</font>

1353
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,310
providers and you basically get

1354
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,839
indicators then<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now you just got</font>

1355
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:58,180
a big repo on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> backend as a model</font>

1356
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:00,400
database that is retaining threat

1357
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:02,440
indicator information you still need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1358
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">SAM or a log management tool to attach</font>

1359
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,430
to this thing and do your<font color="#E5E5E5"> correlation</font>

1360
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:08,380
because this is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a router</font>

1361
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:09,899
for threatening to information once you

1362
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:11,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that in place though I believe the</font>

1363
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:14,320
capability that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have yet to</font>

1364
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:16,210
realize in my own enterprise but I was

1365
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,890
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a facebook faith based thing we</font>

1366
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:20,110
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move towards actually doing that</font>

1367
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:22,810
and doing more automation so that we I

1368
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:25,090
believe reach a more adult of the

1369
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:26,380
ultimate if not may<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as the</font>

1370
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,490
penultimate it's not really the final

1371
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,980
stage of maturity because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1372
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:33,819
you ever get there but for us

1373
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:35,950
target mature state is automation around

1374
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,320
our threat Intel and how we integrate

1375
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:39,700
that with with finding context on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1376
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,880
internal company through our internal

1377
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">blogs</font>

1378
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:51,930
well we meet we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrated we have</font>

1379
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:53,369
not integrated<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge yet with sin but but</font>

1380
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:55,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah that's that's part of the challenge</font>

1381
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:58,110
was with working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with other groups that</font>

1382
00:56:55,530 --> 00:57:00,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">are lean and don't have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyclist</font>

1383
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:06,990
despair so that's greater with the other

1384
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:09,030
time not yet know about its we're

1385
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:11,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">receiving for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Intel feeds but we haven't</font>

1386
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:13,230
integrated at our own content there yet

1387
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:15,450
so it's that's best for the next step

1388
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">for us as we will go ahead with them so</font>

1389
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:18,480
the interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> schedule there's</font>

1390
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:20,100
a great questions we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet up in</font>

1391
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the back with more questions at the top</font>

1392
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:26,100
that's fantastic right now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1393
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:29,880
is swap out our speakers Xavier worry

1394
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:32,930
there is next will be a sabre ash doin

1395
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,930
excuse me
