00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:12,969
hi everybody who here has a job in

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:14,530
information security anyone who doesn't

3
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:16,900
have a job in information security and

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,369
is looking to get one

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,610
who's got a job in information security

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:28,180
and what's a better one all right we're

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:35,199
all in the right place so I switch

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:37,300
presentation software but it looks like

9
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:40,680
okay all right it might be a little tiny

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,680
bit off we'll fix it in post

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,250
so as my find volunteer introduction

12
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:51,489
said and as everybody is aware there is

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:54,340
a lot of information security cyber

14
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:56,860
security work and also there are lots of

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,750
jobs not necessarily the same thing a

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,070
lot of folks are trying to break into

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,660
the industry a lot of us are in the

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:06,009
industry looking to figure out how to

19
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:10,600
advance and frankly there's a lot of

20
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:14,259
misunderstandings so I'm going to try

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:18,009
and clear up a few things but my overall

22
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:19,300
theme is that if you want to help with

23
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:22,420
our problems if you want to work on

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:27,039
information security we really want you

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,869
to come help us you need a plan you got

26
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:31,030
a lot of work ahead of you I want to

27
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:34,179
make sure that you understand what that

28
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,130
work looks like how you can go through

29
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:38,319
it and what some of the obstacles or

30
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,780
concerns that you need to worry about as

31
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,920
well as the ones that aren't real and

32
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,319
that people are giving you bad

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,520
information or perhaps just a

34
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:54,160
misunderstanding are like and I trouble

35
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:57,160
a lot of InfoSec jargon and a technical

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,250
process stuff in here but the talk is

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,530
intended to be very very open very

38
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,289
high-level and not specific to any

39
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,989
particular InfoSec specialty as I hope

40
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:09,610
you all know we have lots of them and if

41
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:11,020
you're particularly good at this career

42
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,390
stuff you might end up inventing a new

43
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,360
one that actually happens all the time

44
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,339
our field is very dynamic smart

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,870
motivated people

46
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,030
are always making new jobs for

47
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:27,810
themselves making new areas of research

48
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:30,300
for all of us so one of the the threat

49
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,620
intelligence themes if you will is the

50
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,200
idea of a whitelist a blacklist and

51
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,780
maybe a great list so the purposes of

52
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,690
the talk the white list is a list of

53
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,430
things I think you should do and it is

54
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,040
not the list of everything that you have

55
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,569
to do it is not a complete list but it's

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,980
the recommendations that I have for you

57
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:50,369
four things that you should definitely

58
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,190
look into and almost certainly belong in

59
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,630
your plan to some degree or another

60
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,730
great list of stuff I'm a little shaky

61
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,799
about sometimes it's good sometimes it's

62
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:02,310
bad applied carefully it can help you

63
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,870
apply it on wisely it can harm your

64
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,120
chances of getting the next job and

65
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,040
advancing your career and then there's

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,170
some blacklist stuff which I'm going to

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,730
beg you not to do and unfortunately we

68
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,920
have to hit a few points like that as we

69
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,480
go through the talk because there are

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,670
some there's some bad behavior there's

71
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,920
some poor choices that some folks have

72
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:26,100
made that I want to help you not make so

73
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,858
that you do get to advance your career

74
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,260
and so the I and the folks that I work

75
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:34,380
with get the help that we need so it's a

76
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,120
collaborative effort there are

77
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:41,040
absolutely jobs in InfoSec there are no

78
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,140
unskilled or entry-level jobs in InfoSec

79
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,650
if somebody told you that they're

80
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:50,429
selling something probably an education

81
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,170
program and you need to to check into

82
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,100
that get another source get a second

83
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:59,608
opinion all of our jobs require some

84
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,200
skills skills that you can pick up

85
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:02,430
skills that you may already have I'm

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,160
going to talk more about those as we go

87
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:11,639
along you will it always benefits you to

88
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:15,510
have knowledge and experience from other

89
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,850
work so the classic path into InfoSec

90
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,589
was to go through IT first right you

91
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,359
work on the help desk you work as a

92
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,210
system

93
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,349
you work as a developer and then if

94
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,818
you're good at that and you're

95
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:27,979
interested security and you pass your

96
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:32,060
exams you get to go and work security

97
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:34,550
full-time I mostly followed that road

98
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,990
but it takes a long time it's not for

99
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,759
everybody and it's not the only way to

100
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,409
get there and although there are

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,259
benefits from taking that road there are

102
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:43,819
skills and knowledge and abilities that

103
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:46,189
you develop that way that are hard to

104
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:49,520
reproduce it is by no means the best

105
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:51,289
path there are other ways to get into

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,299
security there are other ways to help us

107
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:55,520
with our problems and we need the

108
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,319
diversity right people who have a

109
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,188
systems background people who have a

110
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,330
network background are not necessarily

111
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:04,729
the right people to solve all of our

112
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,159
problems for one we are constantly

113
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:10,188
finding and looking for new ways to

114
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:11,419
solve problems sometimes knowing how

115
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:12,969
it's been done for 20 years is

116
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,650
beneficial to that effort

117
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:18,199
sometimes it isn't right we need new

118
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:22,460
energy we need new ideas but even beyond

119
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:25,370
that having done something else in your

120
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,620
life having a previous career having

121
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,469
undergraduate collegiate experience in

122
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,349
another field is incredibly valuable to

123
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:34,879
us because we secure real things we work

124
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:37,159
with real people and their businesses

125
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,199
and organizations and you need to be

126
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:41,750
able to communicate with them and talk

127
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,849
about a lot and understand what it is

128
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,759
they actually do to be able to help them

129
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:48,680
it is not a we just need to pay enough

130
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,210
money and get the smart people and apply

131
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,529
the security to the thing and now the

132
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,508
problem is solved and we can go do

133
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:55,069
something else there are a few of the

134
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,770
problems that our field actually work

135
00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:03,139
that way and that is never a good

136
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:06,049
strategy another odd thing about our

137
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:07,909
field that is mostly good and benefits

138
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,960
you especially as a career changer or

139
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,849
somebody trying to break in

140
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,758
is that our fields are young and

141
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:15,979
surprisingly well-documented there are

142
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,219
not for the most part centuries of

143
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:22,099
history and academic research and papers

144
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:23,389
in most of the computer security

145
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,210
information security and cybersecurity

146
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:28,430
fields mostly there's only a few decades

147
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,109
sometimes a lot less than that there are

148
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,770
not for instance a few decades of

149
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,180
research until

150
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,520
worldwide web application security

151
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,560
because none of those things have that

152
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,969
long and although there's some theory

153
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,620
going back a little bit farther than

154
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,509
that that might be useful to you the

155
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,090
practical research only started when the

156
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:45,379
technology became available the good

157
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,628
news is that that information is

158
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:49,490
available the bad news is that we don't

159
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:51,949
take good advantage of it so as someone

160
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,720
in the field looking to move up I beg

161
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:55,129
you to read our history as someone

162
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,039
looking to break into the field and

163
00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:00,680
wants to impress us with how your

164
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:03,380
background your skills and your studies

165
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,180
are what we're looking for please read

166
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,560
our history understand which problems

167
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,840
have been solved understand which

168
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,710
problems cannot be solved and so maybe

169
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,318
you should have spent too much time

170
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,580
working on them especially for like a

171
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,560
computer science or a physics

172
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,289
perspective if a computer scientist

173
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,990
tells you a problem is hard that's not a

174
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:23,240
judgment that's not them being lazy

175
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:27,919
they're actually giving you the answer

176
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,629
to an equation that says that at least

177
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,109
that method of solving that problem is

178
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:36,380
impossible so we need new methods of

179
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,849
solving the problem or a new

180
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,990
understanding of the problem so that we

181
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:43,699
can develop a new method so on the one

182
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,699
hand there are no entry-level jobs there

183
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:49,250
are definitely jobs another thing that

184
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,440
is commonly misunderstood or perhaps

185
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,479
miss applied is that for folks who are

186
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,349
switching into security but also who are

187
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,969
folks who are already in security you're

188
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:02,090
going to be learning outside of work in

189
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:04,130
fact most of us study all the time even

190
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,179
when we're not taking a class or trying

191
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,150
to pass an exam

192
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,830
we are constantly studying the systems

193
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,630
that we defend the businesses and

194
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,068
organizations that we protect or new

195
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,750
attack techniques that other clever

196
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:17,000
humans have come up with that are

197
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,949
themselves innovative and new and we

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,199
want to try and stay up-to-date with and

199
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:22,460
this is the key point this is the thing

200
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,509
that makes our business different almost

201
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,669
any other we are up against human

202
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:31,669
adversaries with giant powerful brains

203
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:33,049
just like ours and sometimes they have

204
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:36,348
bigger teams and more money to spend

205
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:37,819
than we do so not only do we need to be

206
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,280
good with what we're good at but we need

207
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,080
to constantly be

208
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,059
understanding the changes in the

209
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,460
environment that we work in we need to

210
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:47,530
be aware and respectful of our

211
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,240
intelligent adversary and we need to

212
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,160
stay flexible and we are always learning

213
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,900
so again as someone trying to break into

214
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,689
the field this is part of what you need

215
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,699
to demonstrate both at a loved level for

216
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,860
sorry at a specific level in terms of

217
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,390
actually doing your homework maybe

218
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,000
getting some certifications or taking

219
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,670
the right classes but at a higher level

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,250
being able to talk in an interview get

221
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,990
to at the end about how you study where

222
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,660
you get your security news from we like

223
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,760
to ask what's in your home lab right

224
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,219
these are the kinds of things that show

225
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,020
that you get it that you understand what

226
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,250
our business is like what our challenges

227
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:27,790
are like and that you really want to

228
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:30,610
help us so the qualifications that I put

229
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,880
up the barrier if there is one that I

230
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,400
would say is not college or

231
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,120
certifications or technical skills or

232
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,490
your background or anything like that it

233
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,110
is genuinely do you want to help us

234
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,310
solve our problems and are you going to

235
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,150
put the work in there's a few others

236
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,219
communication skills are incredibly

237
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:55,300
important you need to be able to talk to

238
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:58,450
other humans and we do have some ethical

239
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,810
requirements we are most of the time the

240
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:04,530
enforcers of the rules which means you

241
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,880
have to be someone who follows rules and

242
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,560
even though it's uncomfortable sometimes

243
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,260
you have to be someone who can enforce

244
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,300
those rules against other people while

245
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,089
still being a compassionate human being

246
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,569
and a professional and if that sounds

247
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,600
easy

248
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,960
then I hope it is for you it is not for

249
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,960
everybody

250
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,079
and my other top-level qualification for

251
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,240
you is an understanding of what your

252
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,610
contribution is going to be we're not

253
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,870
looking for cogs I'm not looking for

254
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,029
somebody who has a set of technical

255
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,370
skills because frankly I can teach those

256
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:41,529
to anybody who is receptive I need

257
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,540
someone who is genuinely interested to

258
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:44,950
solve our problems whose unique

259
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,959
background whether it's their

260
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,810
undergraduate major the job they had

261
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,000
before where they grew up what culture

262
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,420
they were raised in anything like that

263
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,760
brings new ideas to our heart problems

264
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,170
brings new diversity of every kind

265
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,050
diversity of thought as well as

266
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:04,439
background and demographics of course to

267
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,449
our teams and to our problems and

268
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,860
frankly especially because everybody

269
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,240
who's in the running should have most of

270
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,740
this stuff and most of them are going to

271
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,930
have college most we're going to have

272
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,209
technical certifications this is where

273
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,800
you can differentiate yourself this is

274
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,630
where you can start to shine out from

275
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,859
the pack of other applicants and believe

276
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,649
me there are always going to be other

277
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:27,640
applicants

278
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:31,120
so skills the core skills for all

279
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:35,170
security jobs are I would argue the same

280
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:39,040
and there are communication use of

281
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,689
computer systems and data analysis now I

282
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,550
put communication up here twice because

283
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,370
it's that important and there's lots of

284
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:48,390
different ways to think about it data

285
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,770
analysis statistics research methods

286
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,240
heading towards cool stuff like data

287
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,880
science and machine learning but please

288
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,380
get the basics down first incredibly

289
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,779
important to everybody working in

290
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,790
security and this is not to talk about a

291
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:03,790
specific part of security right this is

292
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,490
not about sock or forensics or app setec

293
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,569
or compliance or governance or any of

294
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,490
the wonderful different things that

295
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,470
people do in security everybody works

296
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,020
with data everybody needs to be smart

297
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,550
about data and you really need to have

298
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,660
basic skills about how to do some

299
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,660
analysis of that data yourself

300
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,480
you need to be able to use effectively

301
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,300
the computers and applications that are

302
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,430
available to you and the general idea

303
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,520
here is that you should be a power user

304
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,829
and whatever systems are common in your

305
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,720
environment so if you're in an

306
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,580
organization and you're following this

307
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,660
path because you want to move up into a

308
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,100
security role you have access to the

309
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,630
applications and systems that that

310
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:53,670
company uses if it is a Solaris 10 shop

311
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:56,020
running up an office probably unlikely

312
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,530
you should be really good with those

313
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,900
things

314
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,970
before you start talking to people about

315
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,010
making opportunities available to you to

316
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,370
help with their security problems for a

317
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:08,170
couple of reasons one getting better

318
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,240
with using computers will actually

319
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,800
improve your quality of life if you

320
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,300
learn keyboard shortcuts if you learn

321
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,000
how to do stuff without picking up the

322
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,530
mouse if you learn a little bit about

323
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,510
the automation capabilities that your

324
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:22,720
office software your operating systems

325
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:24,310
your and your data platforms provide it

326
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,410
will just make your life better you will

327
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,270
waste less time waiting for the computer

328
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,400
and doing repetitive tasks that nobody

329
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:33,250
wants to do but it also helps to

330
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,870
demonstrate your commitment and it makes

331
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,760
you look good in front of the client or

332
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,310
the Constituent right they're coming to

333
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,430
you with their hard possibly scary

334
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,989
computer related problems demonstrating

335
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,280
that you are beyond competent with a

336
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,530
computer that you're actually pretty

337
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,970
good with one giving them tips being

338
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,990
able to show them how to do stuff they

339
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,610
didn't know how to do with their own

340
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,220
computer then they might have been using

341
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,350
longer than you have really helps to

342
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,120
build a good relationship right you want

343
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,250
them to believe that you're the expert

344
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,880
you're the trusted advisor you know what

345
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,740
you're talking about and all kinds of

346
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,790
communication communication in different

347
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,590
media email I am Chad and whatever else

348
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:15,490
we have these days this is telepathy a

349
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:17,230
thing yet but also in person and there

350
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,850
is many kinds of in-person conversation

351
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,620
as there are kinds of electronic

352
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,510
communication and understanding the

353
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,610
communication is bi-directional if

354
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,020
you're just shouting at people in one

355
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,120
sense or another if you're just pushing

356
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,480
out information but you're not getting

357
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,040
feedback and not pay

358
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,440
attention to it you're not communicating

359
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,630
and that's probably not what you need to

360
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,190
be doing sometimes we broadcast

361
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:41,570
information but only in very limited

362
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:45,230
circumstances so those are all technical

363
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:47,750
skills really and you can go to school

364
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,070
to learn any of them but the technical

365
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,709
skills that most people are concerned

366
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:54,199
about for a security role are pretty

367
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:55,939
specific to the role so if you know

368
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:58,880
which specialty you're going into if you

369
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,889
know which job title is your dream and

370
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,810
you're trying to build up - if you know

371
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:05,740
you want to be a web application pen

372
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:10,219
tester if you know you want to be a

373
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,290
cybersecurity legal expert that helps

374
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,269
you figure out what technical skills

375
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,010
you're going to need and you won't

376
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:18,050
necessarily be able to develop those on

377
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,579
your own before you have that job but

378
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,560
you can figure out where the path is

379
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:23,149
what the prerequisites to those skills

380
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,489
are and how you could get those

381
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:27,740
sometimes the answer is college a lot of

382
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:33,290
times the answer is self-study and your

383
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:34,760
own experimentation depending on your

384
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,410
target role and your target

385
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,019
specialization these are going to look

386
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:43,240
very different there is actually awesome

387
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:46,160
data available to help guide you in

388
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,230
particular there is a data set available

389
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,040
from the National Institute for Sanja

390
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:56,149
Technology NIST cybersecurity workforce

391
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,560
education project that is available

392
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,600
through Web Services you can also just

393
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,839
pull it as a spreadsheet and you can go

394
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,399
to a job role main they have an

395
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,610
identifying code for every single one of

396
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,170
them and you can literally see an

397
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,970
annotated list of all of the knowledge

398
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,760
'iz skills and abilities that's the

399
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,440
KSA's that they believe that their team

400
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,260
of experts who did the data analysis

401
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,779
believe are required for that job role

402
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,939
so from a hiring manager perspective we

403
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:25,160
might look at this to figure out who

404
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,360
we're trying to hire or what skills we

405
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,160
need to train two people we're going to

406
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,839
put into that role as someone trying to

407
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,719
break into that role this is your road

408
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,590
map this is the list of skills that a

409
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,260
whole bunch of experts believe our nest

410
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,390
to that specialty and experts will of

411
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,830
course disagree on things the more

412
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,840
experts you ask a question the more

413
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,970
answers you're going to get but it's

414
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,190
really good guidance and it's free it's

415
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,830
online you can use it I'll have the

416
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:55,350
links in the notes when I post them

417
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:56,790
later your online presence and the way

418
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,650
that you interact with people in the

419
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:02,849
public you can have a significant impact

420
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:04,470
on your success in seeking career

421
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,199
advancement whether you're just trying

422
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:09,360
to break into InfoSec or you're moving

423
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,920
up trying to stay in the field looking

424
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:15,990
to move into a different specialization

425
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:17,939
thinking about leadership as someone

426
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,880
trying to bring into the field having an

427
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:23,250
active online profile and being in the

428
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,780
community helping out is a huge thing

429
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,550
this is something that we give us advice

430
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:30,899
all the time but very few people follow

431
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:33,510
it if you can volunteer in person say to

432
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:41,940
help set up and wrangle speakers at

433
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:44,070
events thank you sir that's awesome not

434
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,600
everybody to do that right understanding

435
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,310
your own resources the time that you

436
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,990
have available your own family community

437
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,330
commitments figuring out what you can do

438
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,490
that's part of your responsibility can

439
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,850
you fall into your online can you help

440
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:59,700
with the tech support forum for one of

441
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:02,100
the awesome Allah open source pieces of

442
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,679
software that we all depend on so a

443
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,500
number of the the security packages that

444
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,350
we use have vibrant busy online

445
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,730
communities that are always looking for

446
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,939
moderators and people to help answer

447
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,830
questions on chat channels in IRC or

448
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,080
slack on bailing lists and Google Groups

449
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,060
and so on this is a way to not only

450
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,620
actually get into the community and

451
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,470
start to help us which is pretty cool

452
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,239
but to show that you're doing it and to

453
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,220
start to create this data trail this

454
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:33,450
evidence if you'll forgive my use of

455
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:36,120
forensics terminology that you are on

456
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,370
our side that you want to help us solve

457
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,699
these tough problems that you want to be

458
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,699
involved

459
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:46,600
you can help out with those projects in

460
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:49,930
terms of code that's fantastic if you

461
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,570
can compete especially in certain

462
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,130
disciplines like attack oriented stuff

463
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,870
there are a lot of online or in-person

464
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,820
competitions where you can earn a name

465
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,409
for yourself even while you're still

466
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,300
studying before you actually try to

467
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:07,450
switch jobs this is a pretty good option

468
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:09,190
for some folks you should definitely

469
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,870
have some kind of online professional

470
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,310
network of people either that you've

471
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,800
worked with before who would recommend

472
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:17,050
you again mentors who are helping you

473
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,990
develop your skills and helping you find

474
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:22,240
your way through this path you don't

475
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,970
have to display that publicly but a lot

476
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,890
of people choose to I tried very hard

477
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,270
not to recommend particular applications

478
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,520
or platforms because I want to be

479
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:34,240
inclusive and I don't really like any of

480
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,280
those vendors but it is a useful thing

481
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,560
for a lot of people to have an online

482
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,480
professional profile that is linked to a

483
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,159
bunch of other professionals right it

484
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,530
makes it look like you belong it makes

485
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,150
it look like you are doing the work to

486
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,680
be a part of the community that you are

487
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,260
participating that you're talking to

488
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:55,030
people and that you're open to all of

489
00:19:50,260 --> 00:20:00,160
those things working towards a great

490
00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:01,810
list of the black list please do not put

491
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,680
a lot of information about your current

492
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:07,750
employers technology stack on your

493
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:11,140
public or even semi public online

494
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:13,740
information does anybody know why this

495
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,100
is a bad thing

496
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:22,500
is anybody participating in the ascent

497
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:23,789
CTF event attackers whether they're

498
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,220
attackers who work for us like pen

499
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:28,200
testers Red Team folks or attackers who

500
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,899
actually work for criminals and

501
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,299
adversary groups can't take that

502
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:34,949
information and use it to figure out

503
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:37,200
what technology those organizations are

504
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,909
using especially if you tell the version

505
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,250
numbers it is a gift to the attacker

506
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:43,620
that you do not need to grant you should

507
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,270
be able to talk about your work in a way

508
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,250
that recognizes your contribution

509
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,450
without talking in detail about the

510
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,460
applications that your employer

511
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,130
currently has deployed especially if

512
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:56,010
you're in a security role please do not

513
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,840
tell me what av you're running this is a

514
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:00,360
gift to the attacker that you should not

515
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,379
give and for my admittedly biased

516
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:08,189
perspective causes me to wonder if you

517
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:11,909
understand things like upset and OS ends

518
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:15,390
and what risk our organizations are

519
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:18,539
really at what a motivated

520
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:21,179
one might say persistent adversary is

521
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:22,830
likely to do and a lot with that

522
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,659
I still see home addresses on people's

523
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,168
resumes please don't do that

524
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,890
I don't want your home address I

525
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:30,570
definitely don't want our HR department

526
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:34,580
to have it unless they need to actually

527
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:36,990
send you something through the mail so

528
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,039
implementation details vary sometimes

529
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,390
you might need to do that for some

530
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,669
reason I don't understand but especially

531
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,350
when it comes to an online profile like

532
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:45,809
that you might keep on an unnamed

533
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,629
service please do not tell me exactly

534
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:50,960
where to find you any more than you

535
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:54,000
should say when you're going on vacation

536
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,059
anybody familiar with please Ravi calm

please do not post to the internet any

540
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:11,409
evidence of unlit unethical or illegal

541
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:13,570
behavior seriously this doesn't help

542
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,670
anyone it's not a good idea anyway and

543
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,950
it will be a problem especially trying

544
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,450
to get into a security or information

545
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,280
assurance role at a number of large

546
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,980
organizations and certainly any

547
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,990
government role any kind of government

548
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:33,970
anywhere this is going to be a big

549
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:36,610
problem for you so if I offer advice

550
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:39,970
generally but no specifics about what

551
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:42,189
your career path looks like what your

552
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,290
process to hunt for your next job or

553
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,600
position should look like I just urge

554
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,370
you to have one and maybe more than one

555
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,439
right one play will never survive

556
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:56,219
contact with the enemy but planning is

557
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:59,200
essential to Mangala quo here are a

558
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,180
number of processes from different parts

559
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,030
of InfoSec that I think have some

560
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:06,610
application to looking for a new

561
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:11,350
position or were exploring a different

562
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:13,270
career field up top we have our instant

563
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,800
handling cycle and I'll pick her all you

564
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:21,220
know some folks are smiling and laughing

565
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:23,080
their preparation and having a plan and

566
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,150
being prepared for when that plan fails

567
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,000
and still having a fallback making sure

568
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,940
that you have stuff in your go bag like

569
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,740
your laptop and your power supply having

570
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,920
a second presentation program in case

571
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:38,670
the first one randomly manifests the bug

572
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,670
you've never seen before

573
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,530
identification understanding what

574
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,149
problems you're facing putting a plan

575
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,190
together to remediate those problems

576
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,520
whether it's I'm applying to all these

577
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:56,830
jobs but I don't hear anything back or

578
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,330
the numbers that people these ta people

579
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,439
are quoting me salary numbers that don't

580
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:02,199
make any sense for where

581
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,060
what's gone wrong identified these

582
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,950
problems researching them putting a plan

583
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,090
together grabbing your other resources

584
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,480
like your mentors like your support

585
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,889
network and working through them without

586
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,240
squinting too hard you can see how you

587
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,310
could apply it instant handling or an

588
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,420
instant response process to this and if

589
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,490
you spend enough time in that business

590
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,530
you apply pickerel to everything even

591
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:23,770
shopping for groceries because you never

592
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,510
know you might need more milk you don't

593
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,250
want to run out of milk definitely don't

594
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,170
want to be in traffic or on a train on

595
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,520
the way home to have your significant

596
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,470
other or housemate tell you that you're

597
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,700
out of milk because you know now you're

598
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,700
looking at a critical service failure

599
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,540
next up we have an attack lifecycle

600
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:45,399
this one is miters but it's pretty

601
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,870
similar to the Lockheed Martin one which

602
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:51,850
is more famous here we emphasize

603
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:53,620
reconnaissance understanding your target

604
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,949
and while I don't really want to

605
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,479
characterize your job hunt as a security

606
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,220
attack against the people that you want

607
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,930
to work for because that goes back

608
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:05,020
towards that unethical behavior thing

609
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:07,270
that I'm asking you to shy away from if

610
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,730
they pay you to penetration test them

611
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,290
then yes do all of this if they have not

612
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,760
done that and you do not have a contract

613
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,889
saying that it is legal for you to

614
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,420
conduct these activities then I'm

615
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,370
concerned and you should talk to your

616
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,370
lawyer before moving forward

617
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:25,570
but in terms of information gathering

618
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,450
this should absolutely be an essential

619
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:31,720
part of your job hunt at a strategic

620
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:35,080
level in terms of hey I'm thinking about

621
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,870
a career in compliance maybe I should

622
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,429
read ten or a hundred job postings for

623
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,770
compliance jobs and talk to some people

624
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:44,530
who work in that field to see if that's

625
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:47,500
worth looking into more or on the more

626
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:49,870
tactical end I know I want the position

627
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:53,860
in application security at this

628
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:56,110
particular financial company well before

629
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,850
applying and/or showing up for an

630
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,830
interview you should be looking into

631
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,600
that organization and finding out what

632
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,580
you can for public resources about

633
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,580
what's going on there making sure that

634
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:08,870
it is what you are looking for and other

635
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:11,760
silly things like

636
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:13,320
are they gonna be around in here right

637
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,200
these are things that you can probably

638
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:19,050
start to get a handle on from from us at

639
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,540
data right from public data sources and

640
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:24,570
this would be part of a good process you

641
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:27,000
should probably not weaponize exploit

642
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,649
and deliver malware again unless you

643
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,600
have actually been paid to do it or

644
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:35,070
otherwise how to get out of jail free

645
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:37,350
card another perspective may be

646
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:39,929
vulnerability analysis scanning job

647
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:41,399
listings targeting the roles that you're

648
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,820
interested in the orgs that you might be

649
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,170
interested in crafting and effective big

650
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,780
load but here thinking about cover

651
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:51,830
letters and resumes something the same

652
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:55,490
technological problems face you there

653
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:58,050
social engineering as a way to bypass HR

654
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,990
careful there but it's a good

655
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:02,970
perspective a really good resource here

656
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:05,790
is a book by Josh Moore called job recon

657
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:08,190
where he actually models the entire job

658
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:11,040
search process around advanced

659
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:13,970
reconnaissance he also spent some time

660
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,500
talking about having done all this

661
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,560
making the organization that you want to

662
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,940
work for create the job you want to have

663
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,679
and that takes a lot of work and a

664
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,630
little bit of luck but if you do your

665
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,190
research you do your homework and you

666
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,630
get lucky you might just pull that off

667
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:32,490
and it's pretty great when it happens

668
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:34,290
before we talk about your resume and

669
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:36,600
I've tried very hard to focus everything

670
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:41,270
in the talk about your plan and your

671
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:43,040
data and your success going back to

672
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:49,260
helping with some large-scale

673
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:50,550
misunderstandings I'm not going to try

674
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,030
and explain the whole thing here and

675
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,710
it's different at different

676
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,690
organizations but let's just say that

677
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:57,570
there is a process and that it is

678
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:59,820
primarily computer driven for how your

679
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,379
application your cover letter your

680
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:07,950
online profile and you

681
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:14,450
resume are processed is masticated a bad

682
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:18,450
word chewed up that easier

683
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:23,190
processed in parsed torn apart put back

684
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:25,860
together in queried as part of the first

685
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:28,590
of many stages of filtering that happens

686
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,899
before in most of these processes you

687
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,909
have any possibility of talking to a

688
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,410
hiring manager or a technical contact of

689
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,570
the organization you're trying to get

690
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,400
into now there are sometimes shortcuts

691
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:40,620
around this I mentioned having a

692
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,310
powerful professional network because

693
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,750
that's one of the best ones but just up

694
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:49,770
front ear I wanted to make sure

695
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:53,460
everybody understands that some of the

696
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:56,160
advice that you get from people with

697
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,440
different expertise about how to design

698
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,630
the presentation of your cover letter or

699
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,910
your resume as something that is

700
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:06,650
beautiful that it's visually stunning

701
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:09,330
that is cool looking and eye catching is

702
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:12,750
not going to help you at all in this

703
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,159
phase and so the simple answer here is

704
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,320
to make sure that you have a plain text

705
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,510
resume and anytime it's going anywhere

706
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,770
near a computer system certainly anytime

707
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:21,240
that you're uploading it to any

708
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,030
application system or mailing it's

709
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,590
anybody you provide that version if you

710
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,899
think that you are conversing with a

711
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,820
human rather than a chat bot you might

712
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,680
provide both and you might tell them hey

713
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,260
here's the computer format version of

714
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,330
the resume for you to upload I also have

715
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,070
a pre printed version if you'd like to

716
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:40,590
look at it and you can provide both if

717
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,389
that's appropriate but if you're only

718
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:46,320
providing one and you're not

719
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:48,480
communicating right know no feedback you

720
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,700
might want to send the plain text one or

721
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,890
the lightly formatted one because

722
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,110
keyword matching is a huge part of how

723
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:58,050
these filters work they also do other

724
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:00,629
stuff regular expressions white list

725
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,700
black lists scoring algorithms and yes

726
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,950
even machine learning and more terrible

727
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,659
buzz words besides are all involved in

728
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:09,570
what is apparently its own

729
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:10,919
industry of processing resumes for

730
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:13,499
companies who are trying to hire people

731
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,169
so another area where some

732
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:19,769
reconnaissance some mentoring some

733
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:25,349
talking to your your your guidance

734
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:31,739
counselor you got one might help you for

735
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:33,509
your resume on the good side I really

736
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:36,269
want to emphasize that you keep it

737
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:38,519
tightly focused of the things that make

738
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:42,960
you different and that make us

739
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:44,399
interested in you in a pool of people

740
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,929
with similar qualifications because

741
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,508
especially if you get through all those

742
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:50,369
filters that is probably what you're

743
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:53,099
facing right they also match the

744
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:54,209
keywords they have they're cissp or

745
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:57,570
their GSCE

746
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,889
or some other harebrained thing I can

747
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:04,999
make fun of those exams because I passed

748
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:06,840
them as I talked about at the beginning

749
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:08,879
understanding what makes you special

750
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,149
what makes you awesome what makes you

751
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:16,590
different and especially if you've had a

752
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:19,258
job before what you accomplished right

753
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:22,499
not what you did everyday not what

754
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:24,869
technology you worked on what did you

755
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:27,119
actually accomplish what impact did you

756
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:28,559
have did you make things more efficient

757
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,999
did you help them serve their customers

758
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,470
better to just save them money

759
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:34,559
businesses always love to hear about

760
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:36,419
that this is the kind of stuff that I

761
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,119
would like you to put in your resume so

762
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:42,720
that I can tell apart folks who are

763
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,999
likely to help us from somebody who

764
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,549
might have the technical qualifications

765
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:49,549
but who is not my preferred candidate

766
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:57,599
please do not include every technology

767
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:59,869
you have ever used as specially if you

768
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:02,428
are not an expert in that technology

769
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:04,918
there's a there's a pretty common habit

770
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:06,090
and it's not a terrible thing on itself

771
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,609
which is why we're in great lists

772
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,259
category now of listing a bunch of

773
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:12,428
technologies like having like a skills

774
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:17,200
grid or a technology Liz

775
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:19,090
your resume bet I've got one yeah mine

776
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,990
is pretty tightly focused to try and

777
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:25,840
explain what my utility is around those

778
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:28,360
technologies so I say I can support your

779
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,090
environment if you're running on Mac

780
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:34,649
Windows Linux OS 2 Solaris BSD whatever

781
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:37,570
I do not say that I wrote those things

782
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:40,658
or then I can write couple patches for

783
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:42,189
them I say that I can code adequately in

784
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:43,570
a couple of languages because I passed

785
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,940
some of those classes in school and I

786
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:48,789
practice a little bit but for years and

787
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,919
years I would get calls from recruiters

788
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:54,759
asking me if I wanted to apply for a

789
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:56,409
senior job or developer position now I'm

790
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,210
not a senior developer and I'm not

791
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:59,889
really that good with Java but it was on

792
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,749
my resume as a while as a language I was

793
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:03,549
familiar with not as something I was

794
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:06,240
coding myself but actually I was you

795
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:08,559
know basically doing tech support and

796
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,879
but really stretching application

797
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,428
security work with people who were

798
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:16,029
coding in Java the funniest version of

799
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:18,759
that was in about 1997 when I got a call

800
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:20,619
from somebody who was asking me if I had

801
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:22,809
five years of experience with Java

802
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:25,330
programming language and we're trying to

803
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:29,320
hire for a senior developer it's a

804
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:31,529
little bit of an age joke but Java had

805
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,210
only been in beta two years before that

806
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:36,039
the guy who invented it James Gosling

807
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,809
might have used it five years before

808
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:43,419
that but it wasn't called Java then it

809
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:45,039
was called oak and yet no understanding

810
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:47,080
how the data on your resume is going to

811
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,509
be viewed by computers versus by humans

812
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,279
very very important and when it does get

813
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:53,919
to a human to a hiring manager to

814
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:58,029
somebody who to use a phrase I'm using a

815
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,590
lot lately knows what the words mean you

816
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:03,789
want to make sure that you are making

817
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:05,678
the best case for yourself please do not

818
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:08,319
include your entire work history or life

819
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,889
history unless that somehow is part of

820
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:13,359
your case for why you're awesome and

821
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:15,460
special and why you should be in this

822
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,379
role most of the time that's not what

823
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,859
you need and it's not what we're looking

824
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:23,909
for this next bit is probably gonna

825
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,909
start a fight on Twitter again

826
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,980
so let me put it this way I've been at

827
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,418
this a while some folks think I'm pretty

828
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,000
good people that work tell me I'm smart

829
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:35,040
I teach classes in this stuff so some of

830
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,399
that has to be true my resume is two

831
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,009
pages if you are not as far along as we

832
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,649
in your career and I am reviewing a

833
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:50,669
four-page resume from you it had better

834
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:52,230
be full of awesome stuff or I'm going to

835
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:53,759
start to slide your resume so that which

836
00:34:52,230 --> 00:35:02,520
is which wing is that I'm not going to

837
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:05,550
talk to you this way so this is cultural

838
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,880
so this country our region specific and

839
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:10,260
some of its different in industries so

840
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,580
for instance if you were applying for a

841
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,470
security position at an academic

842
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,119
institution they might actually be

843
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,790
looking for a CV even though they're not

844
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,440
hiring you as an instructor knowing your

845
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,820
audience doing your reconnaissance doing

846
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,420
your own scent talking to your network

847
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,650
all I'll help you out here

848
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:27,000
another thing that I've encountered and

849
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:29,220
yeah it was on these four and five

850
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,680
eighths resumes is a whole bunch of

851
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:36,390
jargon and acronyms from the places that

852
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:38,009
you used to work if even I don't know

853
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,859
what this stuff is I'm kind of a big

854
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,440
nerd Minecon I don't know what this

855
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:47,069
stuff is and I can't easily google it

856
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,700
it is now either extraneous data which

857
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:54,240
you made me scan which lowers my you

858
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,950
know internal scoring or it's more stuff

859
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,750
for me to ask you about that if you

860
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,589
can't explain what it is either now we

861
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:02,010
have a different problem

862
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:03,680
we'll get you an assignment on the

863
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:06,720
blacklist

864
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,690
as we started our fee Muir is stuff I

865
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,819
wish I didn't have to tell you do not

866
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,470
rely on your resume your not include

867
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,390
stuff on your resume that you did not do

868
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:18,480
do not include qualifications on your

869
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:20,839
resume that you do not have especially

870
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,780
when a simple ascent search or

871
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:28,250
DuckDuckGo query or Google it's fine as

872
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,250
long as we all agree nobody uses baby

873
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:37,990
if I take something on your resume or

874
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:40,150
your cover letter and I google it or say

875
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,279
I queried the board in question that you

876
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:44,950
say that you've got this credential from

877
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,020
and they've never heard of you well now

878
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,870
we have a pretty serious problem and if

879
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,890
we do that before you come on site it's

880
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,330
actually pretty simple

881
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:55,509
you're not coming on site you're not

882
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:57,730
going to get the interview if you are

883
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:59,380
actually on site and we ask you about

884
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:01,300
someone your resume and it becomes clear

885
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,020
that it is not your resume or that you

886
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:06,430
don't know any of that stuff we're done

887
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,190
because this is the easiest way out and

888
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:12,190
it is not the way up if you have like to

889
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,570
be trying to get a job in the ethics

890
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:17,230
business right because for the rule

891
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:18,880
enforcers you might be interviewing for

892
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:20,920
a social engineering position I might be

893
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,840
hiring you for a potential position as a

894
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,140
professional liar that might be your

895
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:28,600
technical skill but if you lie to us

896
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,859
we're done please don't do this and

897
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,360
please understand that people do this

898
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:35,640
all the time but I don't want to bring

899
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:38,470
this up it keeps happening all the time

900
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,850
things you didn't do technology that

901
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,430
you're not actually that good with

902
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:44,350
please don't put that on your resume if

903
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:46,180
you have to cite a technology in one of

904
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,589
your job words for like what you did and

905
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,509
you don't have something awesome to say

906
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,340
you can talk about the fact that you

907
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,260
have basic familiarity with it or that

908
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:55,630
you used it daily for next years right

909
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,950
that that's a true statement it doesn't

910
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,560
suggest that you're an expert and it

911
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:01,870
helps me judge how you might fit into

912
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,220
the needs that we have and we have lots

913
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,600
of different kinds of needs right

914
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,919
declaring that your basic where the

915
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,990
technology doesn't necessarily

916
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,300
disqualify you I'm actually much more

917
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:12,970
worried about you lying I can get you

918
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,290
better with the technology myself and a

919
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:15,879
number of other experts including a

920
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:18,370
couple in the room here can teach you

921
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,160
that stuff if you make it through the

922
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:23,350
minimum bar of ethics and you know

923
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,390
showing up for the meeting on time and

924
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:27,930
some other you know lifestyle

925
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,930
requirements

926
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:32,450
who are you long time

927
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:47,640
when you are successful at your career

928
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:49,170
plan towards the end of your path to

929
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,520
getting a new position whether it is in

930
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,140
a new organization in your trying to get

931
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,330
promoted or changeable where you are now

932
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,740
or even if you're independent and you're

933
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:57,330
just trying to land a new client because

934
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:01,680
that's pretty much the same process just

935
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:04,020
harder you're probably going to get to

936
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,850
go on interview and it might be on the

937
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,670
phone leave to start but it'll probably

938
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,930
go video or live if we're very

939
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,220
interested in you at least in my

940
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,649
experience the organizations that I've

941
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,000
worked with after a certain amount of

942
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,369
screening to make sure that it's worth

943
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,530
talking to you we actually want to talk

944
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:23,730
to you hopefully in some detail and

945
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:25,380
depth about your experiences and we

946
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:27,810
probably believe you have technical

947
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,720
skills if you got to that part you might

948
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:32,840
not you might turn out to a be lying to

949
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,859
us and which point shortcut you're gone

950
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,570
but we think you have at least the

951
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:38,580
minimum qualifications before we bring

952
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:42,650
you in for an interview before we get on

953
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,650
camera with you for a video interview

954
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:49,200
please be prepared for that interview

955
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:51,750
and understand some of the questions we

956
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,580
are likely to ask and be prepared to

957
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,530
answer them and maybe have a few

958
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:57,869
questions prepared for the interview

959
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:00,000
team as well that you may or may not get

960
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:04,020
time or have the opportunity to ask for

961
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,170
preparation right planning this is

962
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:10,830
practically a whole course itself and I

963
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:12,600
strongly urge you to practice and work

964
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,770
with your network mentors that are

965
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,600
available to you if you've got

966
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:17,460
counselors or guidance people available

967
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,980
to you and we'll talk about the overall

968
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:23,760
community network at the tail-end here

969
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:26,130
shortly but just as a couple of freebies

970
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,260
if you put it in your cover letter or

971
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:31,020
it's on your resume we're probably gonna

972
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:33,060
ask you about it if it was in your cover

973
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:37,530
letter or on your resume and we ask you

974
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:39,240
about it and you can't speak to it you

975
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,160
don't actually understand it it's

976
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,868
obvious you didn't do that then we're

977
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,180
back on the last slide you're lying to

978
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:46,250
me and we're done this doesn't need to

979
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,399
happen

980
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:50,230
I'm not looking for you to

981
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:55,990
the most advanced person in the world

982
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:57,809
with Python or Kali Linux or Digital

983
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:59,919
Millennium Copyright Act or everything

984
00:40:57,809 --> 00:41:01,240
unless that's what the qualifications

985
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,369
for that job are in which case that's a

986
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,598
high bar but that's not mostly what

987
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:06,819
we're looking for and if you're trying

988
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,279
to get into one of these first security

989
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:10,630
job but not actually entry-level

990
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:13,930
positions that I think are of interest

991
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:16,450
to a lot of folks here having an

992
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:18,399
accurate assessment of your skills and

993
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,919
still making yourself sound as good as

994
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,329
you can is where you need to be at and

995
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,520
if you're doing that then I'll be pretty

996
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:27,670
happy I'll ask you some technical

997
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,990
questions to figure out your depth and I

998
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:31,450
will ask you some questions you don't

999
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:33,399
know the answers to on purpose

1000
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:37,868
seriously why are people surprised by

1001
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:40,480
this okay for two reasons one because

1002
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:42,190
it's a fantastic way to check for

1003
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,980
character and professionalism issues

1004
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:46,210
seriously how do you handle a question

1005
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,700
you don't know the answer to do you

1006
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:52,960
freak it out do you like have a health

1007
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:55,660
of it obviously I don't want that to

1008
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,430
happen to anybody but if that's likely

1009
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,710
to happen when you encounter tough

1010
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:01,270
problems that you can't answer this may

1011
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:03,369
not be the right field for you or at

1012
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,319
least not the right specialty because

1013
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:06,940
that's what we do all the time some of

1014
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:08,288
our questions don't even have answers we

1015
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,059
just come up with the best approximation

1016
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:14,230
we can install whatever is available

1017
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:20,049
from the repo and go with it well fix it

1018
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:21,279
in the next release right yeah so be

1019
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:23,140
aware are the kinds of questions that

1020
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:25,779
we're going to ask and be prepared to

1021
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:28,808
talk to your skills your special

1022
00:42:25,779 --> 00:42:30,849
background your qualifications if we ask

1023
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:33,279
you about saying I don't know recent

1024
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:35,589
significant security news like some new

1025
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:38,380
breach or attack or cool-sounding

1026
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:40,150
malware that somebody announced and you

1027
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,609
go into dummy mode on us you're not

1028
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,920
helping your case and it's fine if you

1029
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:47,410
don't know stuff in fact please tell me

1030
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,050
you don't know stuff if you're trying to

1031
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,970
get an analyst position like

1032
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:55,500
security operations group which is where

1033
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:57,118
I work I don't know is actually the best

1034
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,640
answer you can give me the only thing

1035
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,740
better than that would be I don't know

1036
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,779
but if I had access to this data I could

1037
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,910
tell you within this amount of time like

1038
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:10,020
that is a lead analyst right there

1039
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:11,250
almost but start with I don't know you

1040
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,900
asked me a question I don't know any of

1041
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:15,150
those words tell me that honestly but

1042
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,880
without like getting emotional about it

1043
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:19,320
and we're in a preview place because I'm

1044
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,010
not kidding I will ask you questions you

1045
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:25,349
can't answer me I probably won't make up

1046
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:30,540
stuff I mean legally good I don't

1047
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:32,190
usually have to another giveaway for the

1048
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,240
folks here in the classroom as well of

1049
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:38,160
all the people that I've interviewed the

1050
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:43,640
last five years anybody who ever watches

1051
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:47,339
the video oh god I have been known to

1052
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:49,230
put evidence on the table literally I

1053
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:50,910
will print stuff I'm not the only one

1054
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,290
who does this believe me and I will put

1055
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:54,750
it on the table and I will ask you to

1056
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,759
tell me about it and if you are trying

1057
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,800
to get into any kind of analyst position

1058
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,450
whether it's Sark analyst Rancic analyst

1059
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,330
application vulnerability analysts

1060
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:05,759
anything where analysis is in your job

1061
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:08,190
role then even if you have never seen

1062
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,599
that data format before I would hope

1063
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:13,500
that you can tell me some stuff about it

1064
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,869
and this is where without resorting to a

1065
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,160
lot of homework without like trying to

1066
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:18,540
get you to work for free as part of the

1067
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,740
interview process because that's gross

1068
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:24,839
right I'm asking you to do the job skill

1069
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:27,270
that you say you have that we're trying

1070
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:29,820
to fill the role for in the interview on

1071
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:31,050
a small scale I'm not the only one who

1072
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:33,000
does this it's not the only way it

1073
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:35,430
happens but please don't be surprised

1074
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,599
and now that you know this you can

1075
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:41,790
practice so if you're hiring or if

1076
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,650
you're trying to get a job in a security

1077
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:46,170
operation center or it isn't response

1078
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,180
group you might imagine that there are

1079
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,410
some standard data types that we deal

1080
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,240
with all the time

1081
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:53,160
if you don't already know what those are

1082
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:56,609
well please ask somebody including me

1083
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,859
after the talk easy and practice with

1084
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:01,890
them if you are studying this stuff and

1085
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:06,810
you are sweating some of the exams that

1086
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:09,569
I am making light of because some of

1087
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:12,330
them are in my past and you know one I

1088
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:17,610
need to take a practice test on and take

1089
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:20,130
pretty soon so a lot of the same

1090
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:22,140
material is there and you know speaking

1091
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,810
personally as I said I teach this stuff

1092
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:26,730
so I have a pretty good understanding of

1093
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:28,799
the material and know exactly what to

1094
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:31,860
ask to figure out what your level is at

1095
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,950
and your level doesn't have to be super

1096
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:36,180
advanced has anybody heard the story

1097
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:42,720
about when we don't allow some

1098
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:44,790
interviewed to work for Google so Google

1099
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,200
as part of their beard and vaunted

1100
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:47,070
interview process there's a lot of

1101
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,149
different things but one of the

1102
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,380
questions that they asked when it comes

1103
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,760
to your technical skills is they asked

1104
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,600
you to rate yourself against the rest of

1105
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:57,030
the world on a ten-point scale I mean is

1106
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,520
qualitative not quantitative so you know

1107
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,720
we'll take a swag at it right so they're

1108
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,050
talking to this one candidate for

1109
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:08,419
software engineering position it's a pre

1110
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:10,500
pretty well done guy and at the time

1111
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,210
Google's way into the Python programming

1112
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:15,210
language it's still pretty big they're

1113
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:17,270
they like going now a lot too so they

1114
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:20,550
asked this guy they asked we don't in

1115
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:22,050
all the world all of the developers how

1116
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:25,890
do you rate yourself on a scale of one

1117
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:28,320
to ten with your skills at Python it was

1118
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:31,770
a pretty cool guy it's very humble smart

1119
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:34,050
person he said well I will give myself a

1120
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:35,310
nine because it is possible that there

1121
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,500
is someone in the world who knows the

1122
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:39,779
stuff better than I do

1123
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:43,800
Zubrin know who IDO is he invented

1124
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:46,190
Python you made it up but in a technical

1125
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,990
interview when asked about his skills

1126
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:50,910
there was room for doubt and humility in

1127
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:52,290
his heart that he might not be the best

1128
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:54,420
person in the world at that thing

1129
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:56,580
so take that to heart as well don't

1130
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,050
shoot you low if you know something be

1131
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,150
able to demonstrate it but don't worry

1132
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,770
that you don't

1133
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,730
that you don't have the skills yet

1134
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:06,980
especially if you're just trying to

1135
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:09,110
break in nobody expects you to you have

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,799

1140
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:24,080

00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:04,100
your resume review there's actually some

1154
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:06,740
fine folks out in 48 doing that for

1155
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:08,480
conference attendees take advantage of

1156
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:10,250
these resources both because it will

1157
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,850
help you but also because that

1158
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:16,660
demonstrates the kind of overall

1159
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,660
problem-solving that we're looking for

1160
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:21,410
in the Atlanta area specifically we have

1161
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:24,440
awesome professional organization

1162
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:25,520
chapters for soö us but CSA probably

1163
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,650
couple others that I forgot to mention

1164
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:34,900
we also have some really cool hacker

1165
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:39,710
clubs like our 2600 still meet net Linux

1166
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:43,700
DC 404 and manís tavern force Ave yep

1167
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:49,630
third Saturday third Saturday and you

1168
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:49,629
see 770 out in carnage very far away

1169
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:59,450
near is already pretty far away so

1170
00:48:55,370 --> 00:49:03,109
especially if you are the the canonical

1171
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:04,950
new person if you are trying to break in

1172
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:07,980
you don't know anybody and you don't

1173
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:09,480
know anything yet these orgs especially

1174
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,640
honestly the hacker clubs are other than

1175
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,380
the professional Lords are a really good

1176
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,569
place to start to find like-minded

1177
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,160
people to find people who are either in

1178
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:20,250
the same struggle or people who have

1179
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:22,020
been through it so I actually got one of

1180
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,760
the best jobs in my life and later the

1181
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,880
opportunity to go full-time in security

1182
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,310
from a posting to I think we figured out

1183
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,010
was DC 404 Keith's around here somewhere

1184
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:34,320
was his fall that's how I got a net

1185
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:36,240
secure works in IT which I was later

1186
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:39,540
able to transition over to a full-time

1187
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:42,319
security job so hacker clubs pretty

1188
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:44,970
great they also have presentations a

1189
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,619
different educational value or sometimes

1190
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:54,990
some guy just gets up and starts ranting

1191
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:58,290
about career stuff in your personal

1192
00:49:54,990 --> 00:50:00,569
community your family your other social

1193
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:01,800
organizations right because we're very

1194
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:05,150
open here

1195
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:08,040
people have different families different

1196
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:10,740
religions culture whatever you guys

1197
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,940
there are probably people available to

1198
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,560
you who can help with some of this stuff

1199
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,810
even if they don't know anything about

1200
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:18,540
InfoSec they can probably help you

1201
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:21,960
through dialog understand what's special

1202
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:24,000
about you and what you can do to

1203
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,829
emphasize that how you can communicate

1204
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,750
about that how you can talk yourself up

1205
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:37,920
without lying or making stuff up

1206
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:40,319
different yeah so short answer there

1207
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,690
start going to meetings which you know

1208
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:45,440
is a little funny for me because I

1209
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,440
hardly arranged one

1210
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:55,250
so we just have a few minutes left is

1211
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:55,250
anybody in the room have any questions

1212
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:06,360
okay so I tried to be a little careful

1213
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:10,560
because it's a controversial topic what

1214
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:12,060
I said is - two pages have as many pages

1215
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,610
as you need to tell the story you need

1216
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:15,990
to tell if you're trying to get a higher

1217
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,340
level position you may need to

1218
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,450
demonstrate that you've done this job

1219
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:20,100
successfully in a number of

1220
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:22,080
organizations of different sizes right

1221
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,610
that may be the the story that you need

1222
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,660
to tell but especially if you're just

1223
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:27,690
getting started

1224
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:29,040
I would I would shy towards the the

1225
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:30,510
shorter resume and remember that the

1226
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,090
computer cannot digest it before I get a

1227
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:35,430
chance - and you mentioned on the even

1228
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:39,000
text text format and that's the format

1229
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:41,430
to upload it can I do it my resume

1230
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:47,610
review also so not to use RTF format is

1231
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:49,529
that it's probably okay it just causes

1232
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,330
security bells to ring in my head for a

1233
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:56,190
totally unrelated reason ASCII text is

1234
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:57,509
safe I was like it's safe because that's

1235
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:00,030
not the world we live in but it's a cup

1236
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:03,230
a lot safer than RTF because RTF has had

1237
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:03,230
some surprises okay

1238
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:38,780
these have a boring version please so

1239
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,780
was there was there another question

1240
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:47,770
[Music]

1241
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:51,509
questions like that but when you ask

1242
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:55,360
about my consistency 6/10 questions and

1243
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:57,460
what you say so if you're actually in an

1244
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:00,550
interview you might already be under NDA

1245
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:03,190
which helps if you're just talking to

1246
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:04,330
somebody about a job opportunity you

1247
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:06,430
kind of have to make the judgment call

1248
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:09,340
and sometimes it just depends on where

1249
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:12,100
you worked if you worked at a civilian

1250
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,690
organization with a reasonable level of

1251
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,310
security but you know you didn't have

1252
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:18,010
any kind of clearance or any kind of

1253
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:19,060
crazy government stuff then you just

1254
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:20,230
have to decide if you trust the people

1255
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:21,940
that you're talking to enough to share

1256
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,050
that information with them I just beg

1257
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,620
you not to make you public on the

1258
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:26,110
Internet

1259
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,490
does that make sense if you did work for

1260
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:29,350
some of those places you absolutely are

1261
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:31,450
not allowed to talk about the technology

1262
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:32,950
that you used which is another reason to

1263
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:35,620
have all this other stuff to talk about

1264
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:37,629
right to have these other skills to have

1265
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:40,180
these experiences this stuff that's

1266
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,560
special about you if you actually worked

1267
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,330
in the intelligence community or if

1268
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,160
you've been enlisted for 15 years and

1269
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:46,690
you you honestly aren't allowed to tell

1270
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,950
me what you've been doing then we need

1271
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,690
something to talk about otherwise the

1272
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:56,049
interview gets really awkward those are

1273
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:57,460
not much fun either yes yep okay so

1274
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:58,720
thanks for the questions thanks

1275
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:03,250
everybody for your time hope you enjoyed

1276
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:05,529
it I'll get the slides and links posted

1277
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:07,920
and if you're looking for me and haven't

1278
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,920

1279
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,449
[Applause]
