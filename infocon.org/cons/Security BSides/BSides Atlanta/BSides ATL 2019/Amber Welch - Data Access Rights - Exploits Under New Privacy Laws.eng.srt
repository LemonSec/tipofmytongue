1
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:08,240
we're going to get started welcome my

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:11,059
name is Scott Christian here to welcome

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,190
you to 2019 and Lenape sighs this is our

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,500
fifth track presentation on the policy

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,880
track we have amber Welch who is from

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
the Islamic company she's going to be

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:43,370
talking to us about privacy and which we

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:46,089
do so I evaluate policies and privacy

9
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,849
programs for a living I have an auditor

10
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:51,829
program assessor I have worked with

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:01:05,150
Silicon Valley big tech names small

12
00:00:51,829 --> 00:01:06,980
startups IOT firms so today we're going

13
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,610
to talk about Davis subject access

14
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,500
requests the D SRS which is what some

15
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,690
people call them the exploits that

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,460
you're able to do

17
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,500
and some decent strategies or those of

18
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,759
you who are working to the company that

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,030
they have to honor some of these

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,130
requests so we'll start with the data

21
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:28,870
subject requests is anybody familiar

22
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:32,020
with this concept already okay so this

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:35,170
is something that has come out mostly

24
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,330
from GE PR that's where Americans got

25
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,330
their first taste of it so we're living

26
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:43,690
in a global privacy era now data is

27
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:45,520
transferred between nations a lot of

28
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,410
companies have branches internationally

29
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,060
are processing international data and

30
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:55,929
are responsible for maintaining privacy

31
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,610
to law compliance across borders so it's

32
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,350
very different from what we're used to

33
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,460
and these access laws even though

34
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,149
they're slightly different between

35
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,369
nations

36
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,630
most countries that do have some kind of

37
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,990
privacy law will have something to

38
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,820
access rights so we're gonna talk mostly

39
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,859
about GDP ours because it's a good case

40
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,450
study but these concepts are applicable

41
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:18,070
no matter where you are Canada

42
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:20,440
California Brazil APEC region so there

43
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,570
are four primary exploitable rights the

44
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,190
first one is the access right this is

45
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:29,680
the major the major issue for exploit

46
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,840
concept so the right to access is just

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,520
the right to tell a company hey I know

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,380
you have data on me I want to know what

49
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,239
you have give me a full record of

50
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,000
everything that you've got the only

51
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,190
thing you can do is request modification

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,050
so you can tell accompany the data you

53
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,480
have on me is incorrect and I'm going to

54
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,670
tell you to change it this is also known

55
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,380
as directive rectification and sometimes

56
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,089
you might see those it's a good way to

57
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,769
get a foot in the door with some of the

58
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,530
exploits without asking for the whole

59
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,630
data set you can also request a Rea sure

60
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,690
this is commonly known as the right to

61
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,940
be forgotten a new gtp are not every

62
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,760
access law has this but it does show up

63
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,070
some places and there's also the right

64
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,320
to portability where you can request a

65
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,090
machine readable export of your

66
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,130
information to warn it over to a

67
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,280
competitor which obviously would give

68
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,560
you all that data as well so there are a

69
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,230
few new challenges that is shown up with

70
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,840
these access laws we have in the

71
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,750
California privacy law the CCP game

72
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,030
there's a concept of metadata and

73
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,400
indirect identifiers they have added

74
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,670
household data and device data to the

75
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,160
concept of what constitutes PII or

76
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,230
personal information GDP are also added

77
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,180
things like IP addresses this is not

78
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,459
originally been an American concept of

79
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,319
so if you're thinking about protecting

80
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:53,420
personal information the scope is very

81
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:55,970
broad now also both GTR and CCPA have

82
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,040
decided that if the data can potentially

83
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,109
be linked to a person even if it's not

84
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,090
currently identifiable that's also

85
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,829
personal data this has a lot of

86
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,110
implications for machine learning that

87
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:08,269
we can't get into today but maybe next

88
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:11,359
year I'll would talk on that so we'll

89
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:14,209
see you then the other issue that we've

90
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:16,100
seen mostly from the new concept of

91
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:18,380
control data controllers and data

92
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,199
processors is that if you have personal

93
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,780
information even infancy we need to

94
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,900
collect it the source possible for

95
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,940
fulfilling these privacy access right

96
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,479
there is really interesting case where

97
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:34,610
this guy sued Google Spain for the right

98
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,960
to be forgotten under the previous the

99
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,710
Data Protection Directive

100
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,859
it's like GPR predecessor and Google

101
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,388
argued we didn't

102
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,280
information it's just the Internet

103
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,219
supposed to do about the Internet it's

104
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,559
just it is what it is but the EU decided

105
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:52,629
that you as the data controller Google

106
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,300
are still responsible for honoring his

107
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:57,819
request to be forgotten even if you

108
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,770
really had nothing to do with gathering

109
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:00,879
that information and the information is

110
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,810
not associated with any particular

111
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,370
account so now that you know that

112
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,039
American companies have so much

113
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,020
obligation to abide by European law

114
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,878
these are new concepts that a lot of us

115
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,710
orientations will have to learn to

116
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:20,500
accept so this leaves us with the idea

117
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,840
that it's potentially everything can be

118
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,129
personal data it's very difficult to

119
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,020
know for sure that something is not

120
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:27,969
personal data if it could be linked to

121
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,188
somebody right I mean how do you define

122
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:32,139
for sure that something isn't personally

123
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:35,189
identifiable or couldn't become the

124
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:35,189
personally identifiable

125
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:40,849
so what how company's done about this

126
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:43,310
American companies went through a big

127
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:45,259
panic mode if you'll remember the

128
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:49,009
onslaught of privacy policy update

129
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:53,090
emails the you know GPR day the day in

130
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:55,729
which privacy wears got PTSD so most

131
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,099
companies just panicked a lot of things

132
00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:01,449
really bad decisions there's a lot of

133
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:06,199
fear the four percent potential revenue

134
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:08,599
fine by the EU was a big scare tactic a

135
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,789
lot of privacy vendors really say this

136
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:11,780
because they wanted the business and

137
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:13,969
there was generally a lot of

138
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,130
misunderstanding so most organizations

139
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,169
took the food direction of just

140
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,729
providing all of the information when

141
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:22,310
they got one of these data subject

142
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:24,440
applies a lot of them also determines

143
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,960
from outsourced to legal firm partly as

144
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,849
a cya move right like it's not our

145
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,289
problem somebody else is to do it we've

146
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:35,349
hired somebody so the problem with that

147
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:37,229
is that legal firms are quite expensive

148
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:38,820
and

149
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,800
don't necessarily understand your

150
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,480
technical environment and the ottoman

151
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,940
period understanding of security comes

152
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,850
out especially regarding detention have

153
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,730
data subjects so in general most

154
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,710
companies fear non-compliance more than

155
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:57,840
they fear a potential data breach of

156
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:59,849
just one person's information with data

157
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,010
subject access requests IRB's couple of

158
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,530
ways that you can honor these requests

159
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,300
you can give an automated way for data

160
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,729
subjects to go into an account and

161
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,470
submit this completely without any human

162
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,600
intervention other than setting up the

163
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,090
process in the first place or on the

164
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,840
other end you can go completely manual

165
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:21,359
we provide a forum for someone to fill

166
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,580
out their information and annually

167
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,830
process that request there's also a few

168
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,300
hybrid approaches where you can have

169
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,930
people put a button in their account

170
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:34,760
maybe and generate a few pieces of

171
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,760
information and then someone else's

172
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:39,099
usually companies decide which one

173
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,770
they're going to do based on the cost to

174
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:44,289
implement an automated solution versus

175
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:48,248
how much they expect to get or the

176
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:50,759
complexity so what can you do with all

177
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:53,680
of this information the fun stuff right

178
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:58,389
one of my favorite topics in legal deed

179
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,939
ups so there used to be a clause in the

180
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,759
Data Protection Directive where you

181
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:07,330
could charge somebody under in the UK it

182
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,189
was up to ten counts both zeros to

183
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,810
submit these requests so even though

184
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:14,050
sometimes the requests are more

185
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,550
expensive to process than that it active

186
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,529
is a bit of a deterrent people weren't

187
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,330
just able to do it for free under the

188
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:22,240
GDP are you can't do that you have to

189
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,938
process for free up until you can decide

190
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,099
for sure and prove your position that

191
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:28,419
this is becoming a himself so there's

192
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:30,969
quite a lot of that report that can

193
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:33,490
happen between that lawyer that you've

194
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,958
hired as an outsourced firm and some

195
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,269
data subject you've got the problem with

196
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:43,869
you before you can prove missus finally

197
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:46,690
abusive this is also very effective

198
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,760
against large organizations that have an

199
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,709
otherwise strong privacy program is not

200
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,600
much that you can do about it so a lot

201
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:54,010
of people organized together could

202
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,990
really cause a lot of trouble for you

203
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,329
but very well developed in general

204
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,490
privacy program is this also highly

205
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:03,130
likely to happen after a data breach

206
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,589
just naturally because people will say I

207
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,670
no longer trust this organization I want

208
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:09,070
to know what information you

209
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,599
and I wanted to do it so if you are in

210
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,370
the news for a briefs you should expect

211
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,540
to have a lot of data subject requests

212
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:17,230
following that and you need to be

213
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:19,540
prepared to deal with that so

214
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,360
outsourcing DSR through legal firms is

215
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,610
super expensive this guy asked even

216
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,500
white free clinic in the UK for

217
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,610
information about the death of his

218
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:33,700
infant son the UK firm have spent two

219
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,800
hundred and forty thousand pounds on a

220
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,380
legal firm to reflect that information

221
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,060
and on the data subject request so that

222
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:46,210
ten pounds doesn't go very far in

223
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:49,000
offsetting that and so a fun example

224
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:52,060
Twitter believes that I'm a man I think

225
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,770
this is hilarious so I figured you might

226
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,660
as well ask the NATO Protection Officer

227
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,910
Twitter why they think that I'm a man I

228
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,030
have the right to do that I can ask for

229
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,530
information about myself so you probably

230
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,760
can't read it but they paid a lawyer to

231
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:07,060
write this it took them a couple of

232
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,280
weeks and they generated a response just

233
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,380
because I felt like figuring out why and

234
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,880
I also have the opportunity to continue

235
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,680
this conversation with them until I'm

236
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,540
satisfied the do request has been

237
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,989
completed I don't really care that much

238
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,939
so I feel like we've served the purpose

239
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,160
with that but there's quite a long ways

240
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,070
that you could go in continuing this

241
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,100
dialogue where it's free on more in

242
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,060
and potentially very expensive for that

243
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,660
there are a few other things that you

244
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:36,359
can do with malicious activity on data

245
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,889
subject requests some privacy firms have

246
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,589
been doing guerilla marketing where they

247
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:42,569
annoy a company into wanting to purchase

248
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:44,430
of privacy solution which seems like bad

249
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:47,339
marketing to me but I guess I'm not a

250
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,930
salesperson also you can do competitor

251
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,880
research we learned about how they're

252
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,680
processing data subject requests and

253
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,160
just copy the arab solution instead of

254
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,138
hiring a consultant to or you

255
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,389
disgruntled employees can submit a lot

256
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,190
of access requests just to pester the

257
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:04,259
company or find out what information

258
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,959
they have and some lawyers especially

259
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:09,389
employment lawyers may be using

260
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:11,279
PSRs as a free discovery tool because

261
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:15,509
they some of the information that they

262
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,579
might need is still there you also see

263
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:20,610
unfortunately of some potential for

264
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:23,089
domestic partner violence or intimate

265
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,549
partner violence stalking

266
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:27,409
other abuse victims since person who is

267
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:29,929
in the relationship will have a lot of

268
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:32,389
information on someone and can get in

269
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:36,608
this line of messaging the location data

270
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:38,569
a lot of really private information

271
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:41,529
there's also a lot of incentive for

272
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:44,718
fishing here you can use common names

273
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:47,089
Google used to just accept the passport

274
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:50,179
as proof of identity but when you think

275
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:52,519
about it what is a name really there are

276
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:55,098
a lot of people who is my name I get

277
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,349
their email address mixed up with mine

278
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:59,899
all the time so I have information

279
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:01,849
coming in to my gmail account DSR is

280
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:04,219
work in much the same way if a company

281
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:05,629
doesn't have a good identity solution

282
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:08,059
they're just going to believe somebody

283
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:09,649
who has some kind of scan of a document

284
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:11,899
but really all that tells you is that

285
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:13,819
they know somebody to pass that name or

286
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,349
may have that name themselves we're able

287
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:19,459
to find a picture of it or even

288
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:21,829
Photoshop it you can also ask for

289
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:23,299
updates you can ask for the privacy

290
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:25,659
officer there's a lot of information you

291
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:28,218
can get about privacy program itself

292
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:31,099
while you're in this dialog they have to

293
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:32,359
process any further old requests so from

294
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:33,409
a fishing standpoint that's great

295
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:35,119
because you're probably going to be on

296
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:37,489
the phone with the Tier one support

297
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:39,920
person and build up how easy it is to

298
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:43,160
get information

299
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,540
see you succeed so they might give a lot

300
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,889
of information about the record that

301
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,180
they're looking at you can potentially

302
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:52,250
match up to records that you have they

303
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,170
want to confirm this in person you can

304
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,120
fill in gaps that you have on a record

305
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:00,500
if you're doing spearfishing or a semi

306
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:03,380
old rod so the takeaway here is to

307
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,149
remember that name is not really very

308
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,339
important the name of the data subject

309
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:11,899
doesn't tell you much about whether that

310
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:13,610
record is actually that person so what

311
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:17,389
you can do with the fishing - from the

312
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,380
profile data and and this is an area

313
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:21,949
where you can learn new information

314
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:28,189
really easily because you can guess that

315
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:30,800
information and correct if you want to

316
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,199
to do some of this as an activity or

317
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,319
your pen tester and you want to see if

318
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:39,469
this is an area where feed value your

319
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,010
privacy policy with tool called private

320
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:46,610
org it will entertain a privacy policy

321
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:49,010
and parse it into this only real diagram

322
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,740
so that a weak one seeing just kind of

323
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,029
flows into on the specified choice which

324
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,010
means they probably don't have many

325
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,990
policies in place about how to deal with

326
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,790
DSR is because they haven't thought very

327
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,310
much about that privacy policy

328
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:06,709
so a really developed privacy policy

329
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:08,449
that spaghetti going on so weak targets

330
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,880
tend to be organizations that have a lot

331
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:13,279
of indirect identifiers and metadata but

332
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,890
not that counts associated with that

333
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,900
metadata international charities because

334
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,699
they are obligated to abide by a lot of

335
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,610
privacy laws and probably don't have a

336
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,830
much budget to do that social media

337
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,720
startups tend to be a little loose about

338
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,640
their privacy anyway

339
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,300
and usually haven't hired compliance

340
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:34,580
personnel also and that is in the

341
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:39,020
middlee regulated space like hospitality

342
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:41,000
and also any acts without paying so this

343
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,449
I found on Twitter which was really

344
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,870
interesting somebody Canada her Spotify

345
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:50,150
information had been downloaded because

346
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,339
Spotify has an automated dsr form and

347
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:56,270
somebody was able to access her account

348
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:57,710
because there is no such thing so I

349
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,660
thought well let's go back to Twitter

350
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,880
see what this process actually looks

351
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,410
like all you do is you go in so it

352
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,640
doesn't problem for a secondary to a

353
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,469
face so if you're already authenticated

354
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,390
to a session somebody could do this if

355
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,010
they just have a password you have to

356
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,620
enter your password again but

357
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:15,050
okay you click the button for request

358
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,330
data it goes into retrieving data and

359
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,569
about an hour later I get email saying

360
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:23,420
that I can download the data now so I go

361
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:26,330
in and but this is everything that I get

362
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,709
it is all of the data associated with a

363
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,060
Twitter account which Twitter has been

364
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,680
around for a very long time so that's

365
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:37,369
potentially a decade of some of these

366
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:38,810
private messages history contacts so

367
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,780
what's concerning about this index

368
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:44,140
subject access rights have been a

369
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,370
potential issue for over 40 years now

370
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,350
this has been known in Europe its

371
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,000
meaning it to me to America but this is

372
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,010
not a new concept and there's been a

373
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,500
black market for this data very very

374
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:57,740
long time and that security as a whole

375
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,910
has no idea about this I very rarely run

376
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:08,360
into someone who's even thought about

377
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:10,010
this being a potential issue so as the

378
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,260
security professionals I'm not enlisting

379
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,780
your help in this these care as a person

380
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,970
with a common name what can you do about

381
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,760
it

382
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:21,680
so the usual DSR process of those types

383
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,990
if you have any kind of to an

384
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,359
interaction at all you get a generic

385
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,100
email inbox where the information comes

386
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,190
in your request comes in and it's parsed

387
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,530
out into a high risk or lowers support

388
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,330
staff usually do low risk even

389
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,890
potentially down to password resets or

390
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,770
somebody just got confused and lost in

391
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:42,050
the system and then the high risk goes

392
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:44,220
to a lawyer or maybe the privacy office

393
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:47,079
which is mezzanine

394
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,790
so the manual process within if that

395
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,710
request is approved is sent to somebody

396
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,560
like a DBA or someone responsible for

397
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,570
running a script against the database

398
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,359
the security team is also never involved

399
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,280
in this as far as I've seen and usually

400
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,410
even if there is a policy that says you

401
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,270
need to identify somebody there's not

402
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,990
much information about how to do it

403
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:10,440
they're very rarely rules about what is

404
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:14,440
what constitutes sufficient

405
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,180
identification for that data subject so

406
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,040
the identity challenge is very

407
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:21,640
complicated with this especially because

408
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,319
of that requirement to fulfill a DSR

409
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,720
even where you don't have an account

410
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,760
California specifically said you cannot

411
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,550
require somebody to have an account in

412
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,410
order to fulfill the DSR so you've got a

413
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,169
lot of issues you can't link the data

414
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,420
with one person potentially my name you

415
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:39,010
might not have an account but at the

416
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,080
same time the tenth is rejected because

417
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,060
it's difficult you can't ask them for

418
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,699
excessive information if you do taking

419
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,740
an identity documents they still might

420
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,850
not tell you who that person is and now

421
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:54,010
you've just collected even more

422
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:56,679
sensitive information so key takeaway

423
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,540
here remember you don't need identity

424
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,120
documents the only time that you would

425
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,980
ever need a scanned of somebody's ID is

426
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,270
if you've already had that information

427
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,400
in the first place if you have a

428
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,629
driver's license number that you know is

429
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,550
associated with

430
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,770
then fine go ahead and ask for a scam

431
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,240
does that make sense but if you don't

432
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,430
then why are you asking for that it

433
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,530
doesn't tell me anything at all the

434
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,780
other good method is that you and

435
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:23,950
basically the only sufficient method for

436
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:27,520
most most DSR is to confirm with a

437
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:29,860
secret between that individual and the

438
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,629
David is on that record so in the hotel

439
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:36,639
idea let's say after this you know we we

440
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,730
hang out at a hotel bar and I sided with

441
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,220
my room number on the part and it

442
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,290
targets to the part in the room somebody

443
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:48,040
else comes by and picks up that receipt

444
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:50,050
has my name and has my room number so

445
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,360
they know the date of the last stay so

446
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:54,850
if that person makes a fraudulent TSR

447
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,550
under my name they would have one secret

448
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,290
right the date of the last date so it's

449
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,450
not when we think about secret

450
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,530
information and transaction history you

451
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,080
have to make sure they're sufficiently

452
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,850
different and come multiple transactions

453
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,439
they are confirming so that it's not

454
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,169
you're not accidentally confirming it's

455
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,940
incidental data that's quite public so

456
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:16,900
another good option would be date of the

457
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:18,520
last day plus lots Portage's on the card

458
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,480
associated with the account and you can

459
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,270
have a list of acceptable options maybe

460
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:31,540
requirement or types if you didn't have

461
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:34,150
a week does anybody know what this is

462
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,980
to Arecibo message yes I have like

463
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:39,130
people that are really excited in

464
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,750
everyone else's confused so this is the

465
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,550
air

466
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,290
a telescope in Puerto Rico which is

467
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,389
super awesome you can never go to Puerto

468
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:49,830
Rico I highly recommend it James Bond

469
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:52,640
like to do the Arecibo message is is

470
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,780
meant to be a way to communicate between

471
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,610
life-forms that essentially have no

472
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,680
other information about each other no

473
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:00,870
identity not even any knowledge the

474
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:03,510
other one might exist so when you're

475
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:06,120
thinking about identification try to

476
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,580
step away from identifying an individual

477
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,580
and focus instead on identifying data

478
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:15,330
and confirming that data matches the

479
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,949
same person it originated from just

480
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:22,110
don't even worry about names unless you

481
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:25,170
actually have some really good ideas so

482
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:27,929
risk based identification processes you

483
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,450
want to use graduated ID requirements so

484
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,920
if you have highly sensitive information

485
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,120
don't just give it away to somebody who

486
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,400
is able to answer a couple of questions

487
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,020
that are quite easy at the same time if

488
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,610
you have a low risk information

489
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,340
don't make somebody to go through like

490
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,439
you know the DNA stand is to get there

491
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,110
you know a couple of pieces of data

492
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,140
about some you know athletes signed up

493
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:51,270
for you have to assume that all ID

494
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,400
numbers are compromised so even if you

495
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,440
have a number on the account if you're

496
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,480
using that as an ID you need to get a

497
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,370
scan stuff but also make sure that

498
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,100
you're not making that email that to you

499
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:03,870
in an unsecured form at all all

500
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,709
documents should be provided in

501
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,029
sometimes

502
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,580
communication all this should happen

503
00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:11,610
either through a portal or some other

504
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,408
way that can be secured it also has

505
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,299
digital identity guidelines which can be

506
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:17,279
helpful especially if you're working in

507
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:19,168
an organization that has a lot of

508
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,730
sensitive information this would give

509
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:24,869
you really strong support that you did

510
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,879
due diligence on this process so we see

511
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:29,459
you can minimize risk you can go with

512
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:31,168
that automated self-service option but

513
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,879
if you do that make sure you come to it

514
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:36,360
they in place so that we can avoid

515
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:39,809
you know Spotify issues also if you are

516
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,820
doing a hybrid or animal kind of way of

517
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:44,610
doing it and there is an account put it

518
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,470
in some kind of UI banner so that

519
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,740
somebody who does access the account can

520
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:52,379
see oh my accounts compromised you know

521
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,110
Twitter told send me an email say not to

522
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:56,279
worry about it it's my if I got this

523
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:58,619
request but that happened behind

524
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:00,629
authentication right so that should be a

525
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:02,939
really big plug so you make sure that

526
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:04,090
users who have a potentially compromised

527
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,300
account

528
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:09,010
being done a little while if you're

529
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,750
doing a request there's no reason to

530
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,030
send it back in an hour if you think

531
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,770
that you know maybe a 24-hour waiting

532
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,980
period would be more appropriate and a

533
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:19,780
lot of data that you're delivering also

534
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,640
you don't need to export accessible data

535
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,980
there's no requirement for you to

536
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,470
provide information to do any kind of do

537
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,090
the eke rest if that dude a subject can

538
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,160
actually access that information already

539
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:32,020
you could just direct them to it in the

540
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,610
application and then that's it you've

541
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,080
fulfilled your responsibility so don't

542
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:38,520
send it out of the organization until

543
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,520
you actually have to do that

544
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:44,530
all right that's a lot of it for

545
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,879
instance if you're like that morning you

546
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,139
can take a picture of this if you want

547
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm not going to read through all of it

548
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,090
these are the red flags if you want to

549
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,240
look for metrics or ways that you might

550
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:57,010
identify a potential attack campaign or

551
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,690
somebody who's trying to get information

552
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,690
from your DSR process

553
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:06,160
all right so the other thing to keep in

554
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,780
mind is that you're perfectly within

555
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,910
your rights to reject any subject

556
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,950
requests you do not have to fulfill

557
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,830
every request your default should be

558
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,930
deny until it has been validated don't

559
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,889
validate until you did since fighting

560
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,930
sense that something might be wrong

561
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:22,000
because especially if lawyers are the

562
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,190
ones doing this that's basically never

563
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,660
gonna happen

564
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,480
they don't tend to think of it of

565
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:30,580
something I need a fisherman

566
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,950
this is your second photo sign these are

567
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,560
all of the reasons that are supported by

568
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:38,440
the laws that you can use to reject

569
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:41,110
requests I also have the legal text in a

570
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,650
TV that I will give you a github link to

571
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:47,590
for both CPA and GTR as they stands

572
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:49,180
right now CCPA might change but make

573
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,129
sure that you know enough about the law

574
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,330
so that you have the ability to turn

575
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:57,480
something down and you have a

576
00:23:52,330 --> 00:24:02,020
justification for it so ah

577
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,670
3:24 I made it so we need security

578
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,889
people we need security people to know

579
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:08,150
about these problems to care about them

580
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,880
it's your personal information

581
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,890
- there's very little that any

582
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,980
individual can do about these kind of

583
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:18,460
weaknesses so all we can do is make sure

584
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,050
that companies are aware as issue

585
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,940
implementing good processes and please

586
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,669
make friends with your lawyers

587
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:31,460
I'm fatal bite I promise to gently

588
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:35,480
educate them so if you want the cheat

589
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:37,070
sheet there it is on github I'm also on

590
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,280
Twitter so if you want to talk about

591
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:43,520
this feel free to I love privacy I love

592
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,820
hearing weird news cases so feel free to

593
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,820
you
