1
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:08,119
challenging name was obviously a Ford

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,650
name we're a swiss company this was a

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,709
cyber security company who came out of a

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,630
could be called negra nigra they've been

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,970
around since the 1950s but we're they're

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,490
wholly owned subsidiary that does cyber

7
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,960
security so we do have a challenging

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,669
game to pronounce here in the States but

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,910
it you say it enough time to starts

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,710
rolling out the time so cool thank you

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,940
guys very much for coming out I hope you

12
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,160
guys are enjoying the content of the

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,530
conference so far hope lunch was good

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,539
I'll probably skip the cliche about

15
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,010
being at a timeslot immediately after

16
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:38,510
lunch and just hope that no one falls

17
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,019
asleep during the presentation but

18
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:44,269
that's that's just fine before I get

19
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:46,519
going I always like to do a quick poll

20
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:49,280
just so that I can understand who it is

21
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:51,289
that I'm speaking to so just show of

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,210
hands here how many of you guys would

23
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:55,699
say that you are watching people

24
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,530
cryptocurrency people maybe you know a

25
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:58,909
lot about cryptocurrency maybe you're

26
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,239
heavily invested is some sort of

27
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:03,498
cryptocurrencies cool or - awesome how

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,350
many of you guys would say that you're

29
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:08,480
either apprehensive about the technology

30
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,640
maybe you don't know enough to know one

31
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,140
way or another you're just you're not

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,730
quite a blockchain person because maybe

33
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,070
you haven't learned about it yet so

34
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,980
hands haven't been fully exposed to

35
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,229
technology okay now the third option how

36
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,570
many of you guys are sick and tired of

37
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,430
hearing about blockchain and plan to

38
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,779
harass me with challenging questions and

39
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,840
insults about my mother afterwards

40
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,240
anybody well I saw one hand so I look

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,560
out for you that's okay well you know

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,369
what a beautiful audience in thank you

43
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,410
guys very much for coming out I am Mike

44
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:42,830
Anton I'm a Senior Product Manager of

45
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:44,100
blockchain at Cadell ski security I will

46
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,689
tell you a little bit more about

47
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,429
what that entails here in a minute but

48
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,289
for those of you who have seen

49
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,590
blockchain talks before I think that you

50
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,630
guys probably have similar come back

51
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,740
from back back behind here I'm sure

52
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,479
enough as it is I don't need that

53
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,979
working against me I think if you guys

54
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,509
have seen a blockchain talk before then

55
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,850
you've probably seen a lot of the the

56
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,130
grandiose arm-waving the blockchain is

57
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,990
the future of everything and I try to

58
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,399
take a slightly different approach not

59
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,410
that there's anything wrong with being a

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,010
futurist any way shape or form but I

61
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:17,000
also believe in pragmatism and so for

62
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,590
example I like to start with a riddle

63
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,860
what new chick-fil-a a Game of Thrones

64
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:27,630
and Atlanta traffic have in common

65
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:30,030
anybody all three include problems that

66
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,010
will not be solved with watching no

67
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,450
matter how hard you try to stick Game of

68
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:36,750
Thrones on the blockchain there will be

69
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,700
no season 9 no matter how badly you want

70
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,310
to stick every car on the Atlanta

71
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,899
freeway at rush hour on the blockchain

72
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,269
you're still gonna be sitting there in

73
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,980
traffic and no matter how hard you try

74
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:49,380
to block change chick-fil-a they still

75
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,328
will not be open on Sundays so I'm sorry

76
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,489
for that if you guys are looking for

77
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:54,720
those sort of solutions then I apologize

78
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,549
for the letdown but I'll let you know

79
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,910
right off the bat that that's not what

80
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:02,100
I'm about I will show you though a quote

81
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,470
that is very near and dear to my heart

82
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,890
and we'll discuss this a little bit more

83
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:10,859
as we go but certainly something to live

84
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:15,929
by maybe build a career off of who knows

85
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:18,420
so really really absorb this one so I'm

86
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,340
Michael Anton I am a Senior Product

87
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,500
Manager of blockchain within our

88
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,480
research and development organization at

89
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,269
Cadell ski security I started my career

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,459
in consulting with a small to mid-size

91
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,560
consultancy called fertility I got to

92
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,840
travel around the country solving a

93
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,480
really hard data problems for banks so

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,410
that was fun and terrifying

95
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,149
simultaneously if you guys ever work in

96
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,829
financial services I never saw the data

97
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,650
that that is there you probably be

98
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,239
terrified too I went over to first data

99
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,069
I just hadn't got enough of the

100
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,080
financial services in life so whatever

101
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:51,450
the first data where I worked in

102
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,670
ecommerce fraud prevention so we worked

103
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,709
on taking a product to market that would

104
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,239
evaluate 100 to 200 different

105
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,250
characteristics of a credit card

106
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,540
transaction in real time run it through

107
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,060
a machine learning algorithm and then

108
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,890
score on a scale of 0 to 1000 how likely

109
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,990
we thought it was to be fraud we could

110
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,489
return that score to a merchant and they

111
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,260
can make the educated decision for

112
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,840
themselves whether or not they wanted to

113
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:16,019
accept the transaction right there at

114
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,590
the point of sale so pretty cool product

115
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,350
for sure

116
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,750
but I was extremely excited to make the

117
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,310
switch over to Cadell skee security like

118
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,100
I said right at the beginning to talk

119
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,980
for a small Swiss cyber security company

120
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,380
coming from a larger parent company

121
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,900
that's been around since the 1950s we do

122
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,620
things like route of trust

123
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,289
IOT security where we've got a whole

124
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:44,510
Corps of photographers and brilliant

125
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:47,670
people so a little bit about my job

126
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,770
these are our brilliant people and I

127
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,930
like to consider myself the professional

128
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,640
dumbest guy in the room it's a it's a

129
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,810
pretty cool job to be I don't know if

130
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,360
you guys have ever work with product

131
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,950
managers before but these are geniuses

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,270
these are our stallions as they would

133
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,090
have said in the show Silicon Valley

134
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,409
these guys have some amazing ideas a lot

135
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,090
of them are technologists scientists

136
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,120
cryptographers we've got physicists on

137
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,010
staff and so as they have crazy ideas

138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,180
for new technologies what I try to do is

139
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,890
like go out and I've fit up these

140
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,050
technologies and I try to build and run

141
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,700
a business around the technology so I

142
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,169
say that not to make this a product

143
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,909
management speech in any way shape or

144
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:22,349
form but I feel like this gives a little

145
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,690
bit of background about Who I am and

146
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,520
kind of the angle and I'm coming from

147
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,930
when I present this talk to you guys so

148
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,200
have you guys ever worked with a product

149
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,300
manager before yeah handful of you cool

150
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,919
some people not so many I know a lot of

151
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,150
the folks that I've worked with in my

152
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,070
company I'd never really worked with

153
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,409
product managers before a lot of people

154
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:43,169
will think it's project manager a lot of

155
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,700
people think it's product owner and I

156
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,070
will say that a product manager

157
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,650
to span both of those activities as well

158
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,540
but I think that this pyramid right here

159
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,429
kind of represents my job in a nutshell

160
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,010
and this will be the end of my arm

161
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,960
waving about product management but what

162
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,580
we like to do is separate things between

163
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,049
the problem space and the solution space

164
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,210
there are problems out there in this

165
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,800
world and we want to understand what

166
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,030
they are without starting to think

167
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,320
through solutions if you guys are

168
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,940
engineers if you've ever been through

169
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,770
any sort of problem solving class or

170
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,540
problem solving process this is probably

171
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,370
familiar to you and then we've got our

172
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,230
geniuses that solve problems

173
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,660
professionally that live in the solution

174
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,550
space they tend not to talk very well

175
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,830
together and so what a product manager

176
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,110
does is owns this entire pyramid and

177
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,460
strives for this golden sliver in the

178
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,980
middle that I like to call product

179
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,229
market fit and this is how well can we

180
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,210
tailor a solution to actually fit the

181
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,190
needs of a problem I'm sure you guys

182
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,229
have seen some amazing technologies

183
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,240
amazing problems out there or products

184
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,760
out there before that look really cool

185
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,010
look really sleek but what problem do

186
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,900
they actually solve right that's

187
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,250
probably the work of someone starting in

188
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,750
the solution space and not really

189
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,010
involving a product manager or not not

190
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,450
really working to the point where they

191
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,719
understand who the client is and what

192
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:57,310
they need so that's enough about me I'm

193
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,900
certainly happy to talk afterwards I'm a

194
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,880
very passionate product manager so if

195
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,090
you guys ever have any questions

196
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,980
certainly feel free to pull me aside

197
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,719
over the next 40 minutes or so I will

198
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,010
give you guys a quick blockchain primer

199
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,230
for those of you who haven't been

200
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:13,480
terribly exposed to the technology I

201
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,980
will talk through blockchain and the

202
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,370
enterprise and then I'll kind of give

203
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,230
you a couple looks into the not so

204
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,710
distant future for the technology so you

205
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:25,810
can kind of understand where it's going

206
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,729
the overall point of this presentation

207
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,820
though is to convince you of a couple

208
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:33,160
things one blockchain will not solve all

209
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,040
of your problems but there are some

210
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,630
things that it knows very well

211
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,840
blockchain has the ability to help

212
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,280
industries and enterprises disrupt their

213
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,989
current processes and move into

214
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,419
completely new and uncharted waters I

215
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,710
really do believe that especially in

216
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,009
instances where you've got multiple

217
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,318
parties exchanging value and a low

218
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:54,449
- medium trust setting and then finally

219
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,819
whether or not you guys like it whether

220
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,639
or not crypto wins or crypto loses or is

221
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,080
up or down or where the markets go

222
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,389
understand that it is coming it is

223
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,369
starting to creep into enterprises now

224
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,169
demand is picking up and so you guys as

225
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:09,869
security practitioners need to be

226
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,159
prepared to understand the technology

227
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:15,409
and some of the threats and challenges

228
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:15,409
associated with the implementation of it

229
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,389
cool so what is blockchain

230
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,740
first let's talk through Bitcoin versus

231
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,110
blockchain because that's that's a

232
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,899
really good starting place I feel a lot

233
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,610
of people tend to say Oh blockchain is

234
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,800
that fake Internet money thing right

235
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,180
it's that thing that they they invent it

236
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,039
and it's faking it of money and drugs

237
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,388
and terrorists that's that's typically

238
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,279
what I hear from someone who isn't

239
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:41,760
terribly familiar with the terms they

240
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:43,349
tend to to merge the topics in their

241
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,970
minds so let's let's get it straight

242
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:48,870
let's try and understand what they are

243
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:51,209
and separate the topics Bitcoin is fake

244
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,339
internet money that was invented by

245
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,680
Satoshi Nakamoto this mysterious

246
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:57,449
individual or group with a really cool

247
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,579
white paper called Bitcoin a

248
00:08:57,449 --> 00:09:02,579
peer-to-peer electronic cash system

249
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:05,339
released in 2008 they still don't know

250
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:08,399
who certain who Satoshi is so there's a

251
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:11,220
lot of mystery around this but basically

252
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:15,019
bitcoin is a network of people and a

253
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:18,839
network of nodes that can exchange value

254
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:21,389
from peer to peer to peer in ace in a

255
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:23,610
low trust environment where they can

256
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:25,350
still have faith in the transactions as

257
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,970
they're taking place so you'll see here

258
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,860
I don't want to get too too deep into

259
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,870
the details of exactly how the blocks

260
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,990
are built but it's an awesome

261
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,779
combination of understanding tokens and

262
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:40,980
stringing them together with with

263
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:45,389
hashing now blocks contain all the new

264
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:47,279
transaction data and each block contains

265
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:48,690
an encoded hash of the previous block

266
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,100
before it so that's how you end up

267
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,600
getting this chain concept of how

268
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,040
they're all strung together so what is

269
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,030
sorry I'm using a master to try and

270
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,420
drive the slides so what is watching

271
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:04,970
strip out the fake internet money

272
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:08,270
blockchain is really just a data store

273
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:11,210
that is built on top of historical data

274
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:13,730
a good description here for it is a

275
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,380
ledger that is distributed decentralized

276
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,360
and irreversible let's talk through what

277
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,370
that means first of all it's a ledger

278
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,350
it's a data store you've got data stores

279
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:25,160
and all of your enterprises all of your

280
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,570
IT ecosystems today if you don't need a

281
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,770
data store you probably don't need a

282
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,510
blockchain let's start there

283
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,220
it is a data store then that is

284
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,900
distributed so we've got a bunch of

285
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,850
different peers running on some sort of

286
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,069
peer-to-peer network and this

287
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,670
distributed network allows people to

288
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,130
exchange money or tokens or anything of

289
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,449
digital value in a decentralized manner

290
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,630
what that means is that they don't have

291
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:50,750
to rely on trust provided by some sort

292
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:53,000
of third party intermediary who's going

293
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,920
to give a transaction credibility so

294
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,020
what does that mean if I were to pay you

295
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,120
for example say it were to venmo you

296
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,710
fifteen dollars because you picked up

297
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,660
the tab for pizza the other night or

298
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,730
something like that how do you know that

299
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,990
my money is actually good how does it

300
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,900
actually make it over to you well

301
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,740
present-day I have to rely on a third

302
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,689
party intermediary who's going to handle

303
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,820
the entire transaction from the time

304
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,860
that it leaves my account all the way to

305
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,950
the time that it enters your account and

306
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,900
that provides a decent amount of trust

307
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,670
what this allows is a framework to pull

308
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,560
that intermediary yeah so it's a

309
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:30,260
decentralized way of exchanging that

310
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,640
value finally because of the way the

311
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,189
blocks are built on top of each other

312
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,380
because each one contains a hash of the

313
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,240
entire previous chain and makes it

314
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,220
irreversible so the blockchain or a

315
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,100
blockchain is always moving forward

316
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,890
there's no way within mathematical

317
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,890
reason to go back and change or taint

318
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,449
historical data on a blockchain those

319
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,339
are kind of the basics it's also

320
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,350
important to realize that there are a

321
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:57,710
numerous variants of different types of

322
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,210
block chains out there I want to give

323
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,310
you a little bit of a sense about what

324
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,720
consensus is so you guys might hear the

325
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,010
word consensus this is something that's

326
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,910
thrown around quite a bit and it's

327
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,189
actually kind of a

328
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,439
commercial topic in the blockchain world

329
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,880
and also for people who maybe are not as

330
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,020
familiar with the blockchain world but

331
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,660
certainly want to poopoo it pretty

332
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,280
quickly it's this concept of proof of

333
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,350
work and proof of stake and some of the

334
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,810
other consensus mechanisms so we've got

335
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,390
ourselves distributing digital value in

336
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:25,880
a peer-to-peer network everyone's got a

337
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:29,569
copy of the ledger someone goes ahead

338
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,340
and transact who decides who gets to

339
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,470
copy or who gets to update the latest

340
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,900
copy of the ledger right who retains the

341
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,400
master copy of that ledger well this is

342
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,160
a really really important problem

343
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,290
because those who have that ability to

344
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,380
update the copy have the ability to

345
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:48,140
potentially taint the data within it and

346
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,610
so we've got this whole emerging field

347
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,800
of crypto economics that's come out

348
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,750
where people are trying to understand

349
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,099
how to incentivize people to take

350
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:59,990
certain very specific honest actions

351
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,150
without jacking up transaction cost too

352
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,650
much without having to insert a complete

353
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,810
intermediary so that's what these

354
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,550
consensus mechanisms are we've got proof

355
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,689
of work this is the really well-known

356
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,640
one this is probably the most

357
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,470
controversial one out there this is the

358
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,750
concept of solving a really hard puzzle

359
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,910
so how do I know that I get to add a

360
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,410
block to the chain well I get to solve

361
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,380
the puzzle and I solve the puzzle first

362
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:23,209
this is what Bitcoin uses this is

363
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,530
currently what aetherium uses although

364
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,540
they're switching over to proof of

365
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:29,510
stakes slowly and potentially in

366
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,579
different chunks but this is

367
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,439
controversial because of its high energy

368
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:37,130
consumption so I don't know if you guys

369
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,900
have heard this before this was from DG

370
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,390
columnist Annette actually this week

371
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,970
they constantly update this number but

372
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,980
every single transaction that happens on

373
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,760
the Bitcoin network takes so much

374
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:52,760
electricity to mine that you could power

375
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,220
14.7 US households for a day just to

376
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:58,370
solve the puzzle that you need to to add

377
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,530
it to the block that's crazy

378
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,840
that is a crazy amount of energy

379
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:04,910
consumption and so while there are some

380
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,350
amazing things that you can do when you

381
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,420
have consensus in a peer-to-peer

382
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,580
mechanism this is obviously still a

383
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,020
problem associated with a young immature

384
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,670
two

385
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,970
Algie that needs to be solved because

386
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,709
the future of payments cannot require 15

387
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,320
households worth electricity for every

388
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,630
single transaction we've got proof of

389
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,970
stakes so instead of my name we're now

390
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,530
forging proof of stick basically says

391
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,420
that we're going to allocate you your

392
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:31,060
opportunity to add a new block to the

393
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,550
chain based off of the percentage of the

394
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,530
monetary base that you hold with the

395
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:39,339
idea of being that if you held so much

396
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:40,990
cryptocurrency in a specific blockchain

397
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,210
or whatever it was you would not be

398
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,310
incentivized to do anything that could

399
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,340
undermine the value of the legitimacy of

400
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,349
the currency or its operations for fear

401
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,670
of devalue in your own asset so it's

402
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,710
kind of an interesting concept it's

403
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,900
still definitely unproven in it's it's

404
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:58,090
definitely controversial as well there

405
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,579
are many many other consensus mechanisms

406
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:02,680
out there there's proof of proof of

407
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,420
Authority proof of importance those kind

408
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,819
of look like proof of stake with some

409
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,150
extra business logic added in to try and

410
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,980
make someone authoritative or important

411
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,780
but I'd say that those are kind of the

412
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:17,830
basics about consensus mechanisms that

413
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:19,360
one should know proof of Authority has

414
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,620
come up a couple times and I've seen I

415
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,550
never understood it could you mind to

416
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,440
just explain a little more yeah so there

417
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,500
are a couple different algorithms about

418
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,370
proof of authority that are out there

419
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,100
either way though

420
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:36,640
it's basically just evaluating someone's

421
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,950
characteristics what can make them

422
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,740
important so it would be anything

423
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:44,620
associated with the time that they've

424
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,360
held their money to the the amount of

425
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,120
money that they owned like the worth of

426
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,410
states yeah exactly and they're

427
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,570
different structures of these

428
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,870
peer-to-peer networks that can allocate

429
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:57,400
maybe different different roles and

430
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,950
responsibilities so you might have

431
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,380
certainly different types of nodes that

432
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,600
might play different pieces and so I I'm

433
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,240
far from an expert on the proof of

434
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,350
Authority consensus mechanisms but what

435
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,900
I can tell you is that there are a

436
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,339
variety

437
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:14,449
than out there and they're all kind of

438
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:17,330
derivatives and proof of stick work is

439
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:19,130
more of like you know I got all these

440
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,470
people doing work and then when one gets

441
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,360
the right answer like you know reward

442
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,350
them they were incentivize to do the

443
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,540
work because they get a little reward

444
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,310
when they do it but proof of staying

445
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:32,120
from Authority the ones like that are

446
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:34,250
more like you know trusting trusting the

447
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,900
person is showing characteristics that

448
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:40,610
they're not incentivize yep that's the

449
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,500
general yeah exactly and I mean you can

450
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,940
have round robins and all sorts of stuff

451
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,290
where maybe where everyone is going to

452
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,610
take a turn there's all sorts of

453
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,199
different ways to do their consensus

454
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,900
mechanisms and so they can be granted

455
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,730
their authority that way like I said

456
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,620
they're unproven and so they're pretty

457
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,380
controversial in the world of crypto

458
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,760
economists which I am not one of but I

459
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,290
certainly understand when you're

460
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,000
implementing something new like this

461
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,500
that has the ability to enable someone

462
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,929
to potentially undermine the integrity

463
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,429
or the lid of a monetary base or

464
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:09,679
legitimacy of their transactions

465
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:11,780
I certainly do understand why for

466
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,150
example you would maybe want to roll it

467
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:17,089
out in a smaller you know limited run

468
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,829
basis so that's been pretty pretty hot

469
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,780
topic right now especially in the

470
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,089
etherion space as they're working on

471
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:26,059
making their shift over from proof of

472
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:27,470
work to proof of stake but it's

473
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,170
definitely you know we'll see where this

474
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,970
one goes with that though it's important

475
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,830
to understand that there are two types

476
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,510
of block chains and this is really where

477
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,610
the enterprise conversation starts

478
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,870
coming in so those of you who are

479
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,669
extremely familiar with crypto

480
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,979
currencies are familiar with what we

481
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,260
call public block chains these are

482
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,850
completely permissionless what that

483
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,160
means is that anybody who wants to

484
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,439
download a node can go and participate

485
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,660
in these networks that's awesome it's

486
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,030
great for enabling a bunch of different

487
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,350
types of use cases business cases crypto

488
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:59,178
currencies whatever it is that you want

489
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,620
to do on that that's fantastic but what

490
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:03,800
we're seeing right now in the enterprise

491
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,959
is that enterprises aren't quite as fond

492
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,309
of just putting their information out

493
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,990
there on a blockchain so we have this

494
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:12,050
concept of a parameter permission

495
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:14,870
blockchain where you can actually decide

496
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:18,290
which participants get to participate in

497
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:20,580
the overall network I will say that a

498
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,918
lot of the blockchain pure

499
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,658
out there feel like this undermines one

500
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,210
of the critical value propositions of

501
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:28,529
blockchain basically saying that well

502
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,450
look if you're going to specifically

503
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:32,399
start prescribing who can access this

504
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,380
and maybe it's not so low trust that you

505
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:36,389
really need a blockchain but there are

506
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,000
other benefits associated with using the

507
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:42,450
technology other than just being able to

508
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,419
decide who has access to it so you'll

509
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,919
see a couple different common brands so

510
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:49,500
in the public space there's aetherium

511
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,519
and there's Bitcoin in the private space

512
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,409
as hyper ledger

513
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:54,450
there's Corte which was started by a

514
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:56,010
consortium called arc 3 which was a

515
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,919
bunch of financial services companies

516
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:01,889
banding together and then there's built

517
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:05,029
on top of the theorem there's four three

518
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:07,620
or four different private blockchain

519
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:09,480
instances that you can deploy including

520
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,120
quorum which was JP Morgan's that they

521
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,549
come out with recently built on top of

522
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,350
the theory so understand that there are

523
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:18,179
two very key paradigms here public

524
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,620
versus private it's kind of the same

525
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:24,029
difference between internet versus

526
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:26,340
Internet right so what are some of the

527
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:28,139
celebrated business benefits associated

528
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,709
with implementing blockchain well you'll

529
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:32,939
hear about efficiency auditability

530
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,590
transparency and security so as far as

531
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,870
the efficiency goes if you guys have

532
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,519
ever been in an enterprise setting and

533
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,658
you've seen all these systems crammed

534
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:41,700
together and you've seen all these

535
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:44,460
manual processes set up just as

536
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,200
workarounds to do with the the might of

537
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,820
the dysfunction that emerges from

538
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,620
cramming all of these systems together

539
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,539
it's a key value proposition that

540
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,918
blockchain brings to the table we can

541
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:54,419
strip a lot of that stuff out and

542
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,480
because we're prevented providing a

543
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:59,429
medium for data to exchange a little bit

544
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,990
more freely that we can potentially

545
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:02,639
disintermediate some of those systems

546
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,990
and cut out a lot of those processes so

547
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:06,479
it's going to be greater efficiency

548
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,919
there's also a perfect audit ability and

549
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
traceability or pretty dang close to

550
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,059
perfect audit ability and traceability

551
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,559
you have the ability to look back at any

552
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,539
block and understand exactly what

553
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,700
happened at any point in time so there's

554
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:20,129
really no corrupting audit logs there's

555
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,380
no losing audit logs because every

556
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,559
single block has like I said earlier the

557
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,940
entire previous

558
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:29,710
coded within it there's transparency

559
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,899
which is pretty cool you know it allows

560
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,289
people to understand depending on your

561
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:37,209
role out of how your blockchain is

562
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:39,700
configured it can allow people to see

563
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,129
into the operations of whatever process

564
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,529
that you're tracking and it allows them

565
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:46,539
to audit it in a pretty easy manner low

566
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:48,549
touch manner that it can actually be a

567
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:50,320
key selling proposition key value

568
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:51,999
proposition for a lot of businesses they

569
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,470
can go to their clients and say look you

570
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:55,210
have concerns about our practices you

571
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,999
have our you know concerns maybe about

572
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:00,009
our sustainability well all of our

573
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:01,299
processes all of our supply chain is

574
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,309
tracked here on this blockchain and

575
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:05,200
we're giving you guys access to it so

576
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:06,940
you have perfect transparency into how

577
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,070
things are running that way when I say

578
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,929
as a business that I am a sustainable

579
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,389
business maybe I don't have to rely on

580
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:14,710
some sort of trusted third party to to

581
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:16,119
give me the credential maybe my

582
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,999
customers can actually go and see it for

583
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:20,980
themselves so pretty cool now the the

584
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:22,029
dicey issue of security so I'm not going

585
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,320
to stand up here in front of you and

586
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:25,749
tell you that blockchain is perfectly

587
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,970
secure if you look around the the

588
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:30,720
blockchain industry a lot of people like

589
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,440
to give watching the secured by design

590
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,450
moniker but you have to really

591
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,169
understand what goes into a real

592
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:40,389
deployment of blockchain so watch

593
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:42,669
Shannon is an application with some

594
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:44,350
really really good math we're pretty

595
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:46,779
confident in the really good math right

596
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,399
the math is pretty sound although it is

597
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:50,139
not impervious it's definitely still

598
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:52,629
important to validate this really good

599
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:54,758
math but as with any other application

600
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:57,189
even if that math is super good and

601
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,649
super secure there's a whole other area

602
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:02,679
of potential area for attack a whole

603
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:04,330
other attack surface that is vulnerable

604
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:05,740
to anybody who wants to do wrongdoing so

605
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,539
it's a full stack out there that you

606
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,330
have to work on security and I'll talk a

607
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:14,289
little bit more about that in a few

608
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:15,699
minutes so entering the internet of

609
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:17,049
value so a lot of people are sitting

610
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,369
there shaking their heads going oK

611
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:20,950
you've got some sort of cryptographic

612
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:23,439
scheme to store data in a really really

613
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,360
complicated way like why is this

614
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,220
revolutionary why do I care what does

615
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,559
this really represent and so this is

616
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,700
where the concept of the internet of

617
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,040
value really

618
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,810
emerges so I'll talk through this slide

619
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,210
here we like to say that we are in the

620
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,919
fourth Industrial Revolution so the

621
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,870
first Industrial Revolution was awesome

622
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,700
because the imagine is we can all of a

623
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:45,899
sudden move really really heavy things

624
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:48,190
from place a to place B that's fantastic

625
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,830
Second Industrial Revolution was the

626
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,850
assembly line in the birthplace of

627
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,460
standardization and mass production and

628
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:57,100
allowed just unprecedented efficiency

629
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:00,550
that's fantastic the third Industrial

630
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,620
Revolution is all about computing and

631
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:05,080
internet we're calling this the Internet

632
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,570
of information so it's exchanging

633
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,790
Internet information among people on

634
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,340
some sort of network and it never before

635
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:14,440
had we seen such freely exchanged ideas

636
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,480
and information that that knowledge of

637
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,140
humanity grew exponentially once this

638
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,340
came out right is truly spectacular

639
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,480
industry for dot o or the Industrial

640
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,050
Revolution the fourth Industrial

641
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:30,310
Revolution is all about immediacy

642
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:32,080
privacy and efficiency and so I'll start

643
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,370
talking about that in a second but I

644
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,659
think to understand it well you have to

645
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,449
really understand is what is the

646
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:41,380
internet of value so in the Internet of

647
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,910
Things you can potentially duplicate

648
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,640
things I'm sure no one in this room was

649
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,260
ever involved in such devious activities

650
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,090
but maybe there was something going on

651
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,400
in the music industry in the last two or

652
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,320
three decades with with illegally

653
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,780
reproducing and disseminating music

654
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,340
right well all of a sudden now what we

655
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,920
started to realize is there are these

656
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,320
digital assets that are of value and

657
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,560
there's a really big problem in that

658
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,330
they're not unique or they they can be

659
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,940
easily duplicated and so this is called

660
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,620
the digitization gambit and it's kind of

661
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,350
the slippery slope that is associated

662
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,090
with sticking everything digital when

663
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,409
you make every single thing digital how

664
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,480
do you know that what you're dealing

665
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:22,090
with is distinct so we've got all of

666
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,550
these things that we value here we've

667
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,590
got identity we've got art we've got

668
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:28,090
visual art music film we've got your

669
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,949
votes you've got your intellectual

670
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,439
property contracts anything that you

671
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,510
might want to prove is distinct but on

672
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,410
the Internet of information you could

673
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:40,810
easily just copy and

674
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:43,100
disseminate at your leisure what

675
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:45,050
blotching does and why it's so

676
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,580
monumental is it solves what

677
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,590
cryptographers have been calling for a

678
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,980
long time to double spend problem the

679
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:55,010
concept of it is I give you five dollars

680
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:57,410
of my fake Internet money how do you

681
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,940
know that I'm not retaining a copy of

682
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,160
that fake Internet night

683
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,110
that sounds really simplistic but that's

684
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,940
actually a really big issue and that's a

685
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,459
difficult thing in a cryptographic

686
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,920
manner or any other programmatic manner

687
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:12,560
to try and prevent insult and so we've

688
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,510
seen already with the whole crypto boom

689
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,490
how much value this can create in the

690
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,260
cryptocurrency space but think about

691
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,730
once once again as we go and start

692
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,860
talking about all of these other assets

693
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,630
think about how much other value how

694
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:26,000
many other distinctive digital assets

695
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,920
could create value if you could transfer

696
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,170
them from peer to peer to peer and

697
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,970
understand and trust that things haven't

698
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:34,400
been duplicated maybe your car title

699
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:36,110
maybe the title to your house all of

700
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,090
these things are paper processes that

701
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,830
you have to sign right now to prove the

702
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,360
authenticity and that the uniqueness of

703
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,220
but what if there was some sort of

704
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,990
digital solution that allowed you to do

705
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:51,290
this without ever having to put pen to

706
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:54,590
paper or do it in mass pretty cool all

707
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:56,659
right so this is really exciting

708
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,699
everyone gets super excited right they

709
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,070
they start dumping all of their money

710
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,810
into blockchain right the crypto

711
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:05,510
currencies are blowing up watching

712
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:08,409
becomes like the the biggest buzzword

713
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:10,730
aside from IOT and augmented reality and

714
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,290
you know machine learning and all of

715
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,540
that that's awesome so the enterprise

716
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:19,520
starts getting really really excited

717
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:20,810
fantastic but then this happens we were

718
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,879
talking about this before a lot of you

719
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,169
guys came into the room but there's a

720
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,690
known hype cycle for emerging

721
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:28,160
technologies every new technology goes

722
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,720
through this process where people get

723
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,070
really really excited about it and they

724
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,630
dump their investment into it and

725
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:35,629
there's there's a little bit of a bubble

726
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:37,190
and then okay maybe it isn't the end-all

727
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,020
be-all maybe it isn't the Silver Bullet

728
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,430
to all of our problems maybe you can't

729
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,889
convince chick-fil-a to stay open out of

730
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,429
Sunday

731
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:48,299
this new technology right this was

732
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:51,000
however compounded in this instance with

733
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:51,270
the popping of an asset bubble on top of

734
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,570
it

735
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,860
so we have the normal pain points that

736
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,928
you would feel with the trough that

737
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,639
follows the peak and that's typically

738
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:00,660
paying for I typically you see companies

739
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,030
and startups running out of business

740
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,830
people saying oh that's over the future

741
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,530
is over this this was all a fad right

742
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,299
whatever this was compounded by the fact

743
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,530
that you had all of these assets out

744
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:13,350
there that were just completely being

745
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:15,450
fabricated on a whim you know we've got

746
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,790
a CEO is happening left and right a lot

747
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,320
of times based not really on any

748
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,940
specific value right these are

749
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,370
speculative assets that are just moving

750
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,900
up and down and they were moving up as

751
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,820
long as everyone was really into the

752
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,590
technology but the second people started

753
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,530
to become a little bit more bearish they

754
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:35,428
crashed and this just is completely like

755
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:39,600
pilot drove the the rest of the industry

756
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:42,510
and so understand that the recession in

757
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,129
interest is a combination of something

758
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,470
that is very predictable in the hype

759
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,990
cycle compounded by something that is a

760
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:53,790
little bit more unprecedented technology

761
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:56,190
was surrounded by an asset bubble so

762
00:27:53,790 --> 00:28:00,809
since and driving this thing from a NASA

763
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:03,390
stuff so since that bust people in

764
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:04,200
industry have been watching blockchain

765
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,650
in the development of the technology

766
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,990
kind of like this they they see that

767
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:11,460
there's value in implementing technology

768
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,590
and we see this in enterprises right now

769
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,390
like oh we've got an idea about this

770
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,409
thing that we might be able to do we

771
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,419
could probably cut out some

772
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,710
intermediaries we might be able to make

773
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,090
things more efficient we've had this

774
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,179
problem that's kind of been nagging us

775
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:26,879
for a while but dang like that whole

776
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:28,320
cryptocurrency things so they're sitting

777
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,000
there and they're watching the industry

778
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,918
evolve but they've been kind of sloped

779
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,830
to try and adopt it and start to bring

780
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,950
this into enterprise and so now a year

781
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,439
and a half or so after you know a lot of

782
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,790
the air was taken out of the balloon

783
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,650
we're starting to see some of the

784
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,918
interest really start to rebound in the

785
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,919
enterprise

786
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:52,560
all right so let's talk through

787
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:55,560
enterprise needs blockchain solves every

788
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,240
problem no enterprises who wants to

789
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,940
implement blockchain have to understand

790
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,710
that first right they have to reduce the

791
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,510
scope as if they were implementing any

792
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,400
other technology to understand exactly

793
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:08,610
what problem it is that we're trying to

794
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,770
solve I kind of hit on this earlier in

795
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,840
my arm wavy product managers speech with

796
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,340
the triangle but you have to understand

797
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,750
who your customer is and you have to

798
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,220
understand what those customers need

799
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,930
before you start coming up with

800
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,520
solutions so when you start saying

801
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:25,040
blockchain solves every problem

802
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,040
think again reduce the scope slowdown

803
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:31,770
why do people care about Bachchan in the

804
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,090
enterprise well here are five pretty

805
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,000
good reasons that we've seen so far

806
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,679
we've seen interest popping up various

807
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,870
places in the c-suite originally we're

808
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,850
seeing it just pop up and R&D shops as

809
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,320
some you know some guy in R&D shop and

810
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,969
maybe get like a little bit of a budget

811
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,100
he had a cool idea it was a pet project

812
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:48,750
we're starting to see that shift though

813
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,060
as this becomes a little bit more of a

814
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,740
conversation in the c-suite so

815
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,389
blockchain removes the need to trust a

816
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,460
third party I kind of beat that one to

817
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,320
death earlier but blockchain removes the

818
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,130
need to wait for a third party so I

819
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,710
don't know if you guys have ever

820
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,180
transferred money via ACH before or if

821
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,560
you've ever had to go through the credit

822
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,780
card processing process where you have

823
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,909
authorization and settlement but it's

824
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,889
extremely slow and it's extremely slow

825
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,660
because it's extremely dysfunctional how

826
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,970
many different hands are in that pot

827
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,160
you've got so many systems in there that

828
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,080
everything is trying to flow through

829
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,820
what blockchain presents is a platform

830
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,139
for that data to flow a little bit more

831
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,129
seamlessly so that you don't end up

832
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,460
having to sit around and wait for

833
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:28,590
everybody else to get their job done

834
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,390
blockchain removes the need to submit to

835
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,679
a third party now what does this mean I

836
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,360
don't know if you guys have ever found

837
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,220
yourself in industries before that have

838
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,959
been dominated by one really really

839
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,030
aggressive third party a lot of times

840
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,340
these might be certification companies

841
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:44,580
and so I gave you the example earlier

842
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,830
about companies that are producing

843
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,300
products let's say paper they're

844
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,040
producing their paper products and

845
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,000
everyone really cares that their paper

846
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,500
is sustainable

847
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,660
well these companies are being held

848
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,120
hostage right now by third parties that

849
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,590
are charging them a fortune to stick the

850
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,029
green seal of approval

851
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,168
the outside of their packaging and so

852
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:03,760
they end up having to comply with a

853
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:06,520
bunch of different regulations or rules

854
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,559
or processes that don't really apply to

855
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,658
their exact niche or exactly what

856
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,000
they're doing doesn't really prove that

857
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:14,950
there any more sustainable and yet

858
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,840
they're being held hostage that they you

859
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,220
know they cannot sell into this market

860
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,299
unless they get some sort of thumbs up

861
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,400
saying that they're producing their

862
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:24,100
paper in a sustainable manner well what

863
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,360
if I said this earlier what if all of a

864
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,689
sudden now companies could put their

865
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,189
entire supply chain in a manner that was

866
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,140
visible so that people who cared about

867
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,580
sustainability could easily audit every

868
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:36,309
single process that they're doing and

869
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:38,049
trust that the product that they're

870
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:39,970
buying is green without having to look

871
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:43,629
for some specific logo on a piece of

872
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:46,059
packaging pretty cool people believe it

873
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:48,610
to be encrypted mathematically sounding

874
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:50,470
and immutable it is more secure that is

875
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,299
true but I added those caveats earlier

876
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,149
and those caveats are very important and

877
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:56,440
I'll hit on those again in a second

878
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:59,020
people also believe that it can protect

879
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,909
from attack and protect private

880
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:04,418
information and prove the truth so this

881
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:06,640
kind of bridges trustworthiness with

882
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:08,110
digital assets so we see so much stuff

883
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,750
fabricated all over the Internet today

884
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:15,090
this brings Trust to what you see

885
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:15,090
because you can audit it's its origins

886
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:20,799
so I'd like to talk through a few of my

887
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:23,709
favorite examples of how blockchain is

888
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,408
being implemented in enterprise settings

889
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,970
and so this one this first one that I'll

890
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:30,669
talk through is actually something I've

891
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:32,740
got to witness almost firsthand two

892
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:34,870
weeks ago at the blockchain Revolution

893
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,880
global conference in Toronto thought was

894
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:41,320
really neat so we had up there on a

895
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:44,049
stage sworn enemies it was FedEx UPS and

896
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,600
DHL sitting all there next to each other

897
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:48,668
and they were talking about how they've

898
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,740
teamed up with hundreds of other people

899
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:53,110
in the transportation logistics industry

900
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:57,220
to try and solve a variety of problems

901
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:58,539
that they've spotted currently and I

902
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,250
didn't know this I was not as familiar

903
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:01,929
with the industry I don't know if you

904
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:05,120
know that systemically a lot of these

905
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:06,830
guys rely on each other to move

906
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,899
packages throughout their systems so if

907
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,439
they're in the business of delivering

908
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,880
things

909
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,710
FedEx may actually have UPS take one of

910
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,650
their packages from point B to C and

911
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:21,950
then UPS might actually have DHL then

912
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:23,960
take that package from C to D all then

913
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,330
to be delivered back to a FedEx guy back

914
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,210
to your door right it's a very cool

915
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:31,010
mingled industry and with that the data

916
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,780
associated with tracking packages

917
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:36,080
throughout that entire movement process

918
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:38,030
is really really messy so that was just

919
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,409
kind of a pain point that was a point of

920
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,450
the inefficiency up until a couple of

921
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,190
years ago when someone was trying to

922
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:45,110
launch a some sort of terrorist plot

923
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:48,080
where there are shipping bombs and setup

924
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:49,879
on printer cartridges and the Department

925
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,470
of Defense came to them and said you

926
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,720
guys need to track down every single

927
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:58,310
printer cartridge in your entire network

928
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,600
and they go that's stuff we got a lot of

929
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,700
different systems of record here that

930
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,080
we're trying to track things down and oh

931
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,520
yeah the stakes are really high because

932
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,470
if you don't get to them soon enough

933
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,719
like these things are going to blow up

934
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,850
right so that prevented that that

935
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,439
presented a terrific burning platform

936
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,469
for these guys to band together and say

937
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,700
well look this is probably not the first

938
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,929
time this has happened it certainly

939
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:20,779
isn't going to be the last time this has

940
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:23,659
happened if we can't solve this problem

941
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:25,160
among ourselves in a tiny manner then

942
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,569
the government's going to solve it for

943
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,399
us and they're going to implement some

944
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:30,470
sort of crazy regulation and I don't

945
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,360
know if you guys have tried to to to

946
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:33,770
comply with regulations implemented by

947
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:36,380
the government before but they aren't

948
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:38,330
always done with the level of expertise

949
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,250
that a practitioner with hope they were

950
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,049
the level of care that practitioner

951
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,370
would hope they put in to developing

952
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,810
some of these regulations so a lot of

953
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:47,000
times they're very disruptive and

954
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:48,860
they're very expensive to comply with so

955
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,409
this is an awesome example of sworn

956
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:53,150
competitors caught up in a what they

957
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:54,649
were calling co-op petition it was an

958
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:56,070
awesome order and I think it's a great

959
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,200
word to keep in mind as we

960
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:00,150
at other use cases for blockchain the

961
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,830
concept that yes we're competitors yes

962
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,240
we all want to beat each other but we

963
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,830
also understand that there are some

964
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,319
problems that we are incapable of

965
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:09,090
solving alone and if we can find a way

966
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,010
and a medium for us to lay down our

967
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,300
swords for a little while and we can

968
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,100
actually cooperate we can actually

969
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,960
really implement some amazing change so

970
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,670
pretty cool use case I was proud of them

971
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,310
to see that that was uh that was

972
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:23,460
definitely new one for me also had the

973
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:25,350
amazing luxury of speaking to the CEO of

974
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:29,100
a company called suite bridge is a

975
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:31,350
company based in Arizona and these guys

976
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,290
want to rethink the entire financial

977
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:36,060
system and this is a pretty audacious

978
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:37,860
effort and I really want to abstract

979
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,930
this from cryptocurrency because this is

980
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,100
not a cryptocurrency company basically

981
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,930
what they've done is they've looked

982
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,509
across all of these different companies

983
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:47,069
in the world yeah you guys if you guys

984
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,630
we're for enterprises you have your full

985
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:51,360
finance teams you have your full

986
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,950
accounting teams if you ever looked at

987
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,030
their processes and their systems and

988
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,830
everything that they do there is an

989
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,560
enormous amount of dysfunction in there

990
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:00,029
and none of the systems really talk well

991
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,650
to each other largely because of a

992
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:03,840
really big data governance and data

993
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:06,300
normalization problem so these systems

994
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,470
were implemented to do one thing but

995
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,880
they really need to talk to something

996
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,990
else and do something else and they

997
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,610
don't quite do that very well so then

998
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,200
you have all these jobs created all

999
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,150
these middlemen that have to just

1000
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,710
manually transpose data from one system

1001
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,390
to another or manually interpret data

1002
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,100
from one system to another well that

1003
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:25,200
gets even worse as companies begin to

1004
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,540
try and exchange value so now all of a

1005
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,970
sudden we're transacting and I sell you

1006
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,470
a widget right and it sits on my books

1007
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,060
one way and it sits on your books a

1008
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,560
different way and those ways may not

1009
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,240
line up depending on what systems

1010
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,560
they're run through and who is

1011
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,359
interpreting the accounting as it was

1012
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,830
all happening now this would be a really

1013
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,750
hard problem to solve though because

1014
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:45,270
there is a massive data normalization

1015
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:49,020
problem so what these guys are trying to

1016
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:51,060
do is solve the puzzle of data

1017
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,030
normalization in the financial services

1018
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,799
in the financial world not just in

1019
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:58,080
financial services but specifically as

1020
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,750
it applies to enterprises in general

1021
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,310
anybody who wants to be able to make all

1022
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,620
their systems not only talks to you

1023
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:06,330
mostly but also talk across company

1024
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,720
lines to other company systems as well

1025
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:10,370
kind of a great ERP and

1026
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,990
sky if you will so it's a pretty

1027
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,040
audacious goal it's been really

1028
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:15,049
impressive the work that they've been

1029
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,460
doing they unlike a lot of the

1030
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,260
blockchain companies they've been

1031
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,610
working most closely with lawyers and

1032
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,840
accountants which is pretty crazy

1033
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,340
because almost everybody else is

1034
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,440
developing their stuff with either

1035
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:27,950
really good marketing guys or actual

1036
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,690
developers hopefully so it was

1037
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,339
definitely impressed with the

1038
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:34,220
conversation that we had with Scott

1039
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,540
Nelson a suite bridge I have three more

1040
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,870
examples that I'll run through pretty

1041
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:43,220
quickly here if I can get the slide to

1042
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:47,120
change first in healthcare so MIT Media

1043
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:49,069
labs has created an interoperability

1044
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,200
from the interoperable so that's a tough

1045
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:55,430
word to say an interoperable blockchain

1046
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,200
that tracks patient medical data so it

1047
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:01,100
allows you to go from one doctor to

1048
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:03,049
another and easily and seamlessly bring

1049
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,980
with you all of your medical records so

1050
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,720
that they don't have this whole thing

1051
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,920
where you show up in the ER and they go

1052
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,120
I don't know you know what pills does he

1053
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,650
take I don't know what medical

1054
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,970
conditions is he take I don't know this

1055
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,800
is a really big problem right now and

1056
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,930
it's inhibiting people's ability to

1057
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,730
receive quality medical treatment

1058
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,640
quickly especially with time counts and

1059
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:21,290
so it's pretty cool work that MIT Media

1060
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,960
Lab has been doing to implement in this

1061
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:26,740
this blockchain to track people medical

1062
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,300
history for them in a private manner

1063
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:31,069
supply chain so this is one that we

1064
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,740
heard about quite a bit in Toronto two

1065
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:37,040
weeks ago so Walmart has teamed up with

1066
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:39,709
Tsinghua University in China to bring

1067
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,420
credibility back to food supply chains

1068
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,340
so there's this really big problem

1069
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,960
especially in China right now where the

1070
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,400
product we think you're buying isn't

1071
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,000
necessarily the product you were buying

1072
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,920
and sometimes that's just kind of funny

1073
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,030
and whimsical and inefficient and oh

1074
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,220
darn maybe I got

1075
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:57,080
a few bucks sometimes though it's it's

1076
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,850
life-threatening and so there are some

1077
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,860
legitimate medical risks that can come

1078
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,750
out of eating counterfeited foods or

1079
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:05,480
maybe foods that weren't transported a

1080
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:07,940
safe and secure manner cold chain is a

1081
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,320
really good example of this and cold

1082
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,580
chain sounds like a block chain thing

1083
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,750
because it has the word chain in it but

1084
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,670
it's not it's actually it's a

1085
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:16,550
transportation logistics thing you guys

1086
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:18,170
are cold chain transportation before no

1087
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:19,370
Sokol change transportation is actually

1088
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,650
really simple concept it's basically

1089
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:23,540
just the premise that food needs to be

1090
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,850
transported from point A to B to C to D

1091
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:28,580
to e at a certain temperature it is

1092
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:30,740
literally a cold supply chain very

1093
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:34,009
simple concept but what we have here is

1094
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:35,930
kind of a complex web of 10 15 20 30

1095
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:38,270
different participants that all have to

1096
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:40,370
be trusted to actually transport that

1097
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:42,500
food from point A to B to C to D he

1098
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:45,200
handed off to each other on time before

1099
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,330
the expiration date and O they also have

1100
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,950
to keep it cold the whole time well so

1101
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:51,770
all of these guys are separate companies

1102
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:53,899
they're low trust or you know medium

1103
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:55,520
trust third parties and they're actually

1104
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,960
incentivized to cheat because it's

1105
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,370
actually very expensive to keep

1106
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,450
something refrigerated for that long a

1107
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,980
period of time especially if you

1108
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,919
hollering across the desert or whatever

1109
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,630
and so this is a terrific example of how

1110
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,110
blockchain can bring trust to the

1111
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,610
situation how we can actually track the

1112
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,290
temperature that and that food was

1113
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:13,280
stored throughout the entire supply

1114
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,500
chain and to end

1115
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,910
and validate that the food that was

1116
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,440
being transported was the food that we

1117
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:21,770
intended to transport in the first place

1118
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,960
so pretty cool a lot of great work being

1119
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,520
done by IBM and Walmart and sing while

1120
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,200
University in food trust and I

1121
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,540
definitely yeah good I just would like

1122
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,790
to understand the math behind that if

1123
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:35,180
that's possible so if I'm in a truck

1124
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:37,359
driving across the desert today and I

1125
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:40,578
mean

1126
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,410
other people right so you might be

1127
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:44,089
broadcasting your sensor data out there

1128
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:46,569
right exactly so what you're creating

1129
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:49,759
there is effectively a consortium so

1130
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:51,499
kind of like how we say Bitcoin everyone

1131
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:52,579
in here can be a Bitcoin node right and

1132
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:54,379
everyone in here can validate each

1133
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:55,969
other's transactions what we're talking

1134
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,140
about here in the supply your supply

1135
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:59,989
chain use case is a little bit more of a

1136
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,420
consortium application so we've got

1137
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:04,609
maybe 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 trusted nodes

1138
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,289
on here we know who these companies are

1139
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:08,119
and they're all want to take turns

1140
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:09,890
validating the data through some sort of

1141
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:17,269
consensus like the chain was about 8

1142
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:18,979
pieces right yeah ok so then finally

1143
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:20,029
insurance and this is a really cool use

1144
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:21,649
case because this is actually something

1145
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:22,699
that you guys can mess with today if you

1146
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,489
would like so there's a company called

1147
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:26,689
AXA out there and this was pretty neat

1148
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:28,519
actually just not about this one that's

1149
00:41:26,689 --> 00:41:30,469
we're going to go they've released a

1150
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:33,229
insurance a travel insurance product

1151
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:34,579
called fizzy it's really neat so if you

1152
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:35,868
guys have ever traveled before which I'm

1153
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:37,609
sure all of you guys have then you've

1154
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:40,099
probably had convenience of being

1155
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:42,140
delayed or having your bags lost or any

1156
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:45,979
of those things it's just a fact of life

1157
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:47,920
when you travel for work a lot of the

1158
00:41:45,979 --> 00:41:51,288
airlines will either offer to sell you

1159
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,299
travel insurance to recoup your losses

1160
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:54,679
should you incur any and get that go to

1161
00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:57,920
lunch for an extra 30 minutes because

1162
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:59,420
your flight was delayed a lot of times

1163
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,160
though it's kind of difficult it's it's

1164
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,109
a pain in the butt to collect those

1165
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,459
losses after it's actually happened and

1166
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:06,589
a lot of times they still ask that you

1167
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:08,089
submit proof that you actually incurred

1168
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:09,439
those losses which is kind of another

1169
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:10,939
thing so you end up having to put

1170
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:12,920
paperwork together as though you're

1171
00:42:10,939 --> 00:42:14,569
filing to some sort of larger insurance

1172
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,589
claim and so this is convenience that

1173
00:42:14,569 --> 00:42:18,650
you're getting is really not that

1174
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:21,319
convenient all together so through the

1175
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:23,869
creative use of smart contracts access

1176
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:25,910
product fizzy is pretty cool it allows

1177
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:28,130
you to go in and purchase insurance for

1178
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:30,678
flight all that flight information is

1179
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,479
out there publicly accessible and

1180
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:34,009
they've got a smart contract sitting out

1181
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:35,689
there and that smart contract is

1182
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,939
tracking your flight and if your flight

1183
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:39,979
becomes more than two hours delayed it

1184
00:42:37,939 --> 00:42:42,170
immediately triggers a smart contract

1185
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:43,968
and sends you the money it's factual

1186
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,559
right your flight was factually delayed

1187
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:47,710
and so what you're insuring against is

1188
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:49,240
the losses that could

1189
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:50,319
you could incur in the event that your

1190
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,169
flight was delayed by more than two

1191
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,599
hours so it removes all these processes

1192
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,920
of you having to go and file and prove

1193
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,180
and all this stuff and it's

1194
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,680
instantaneous there's no phone calls

1195
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:03,000
there's no following up with anybody you

1196
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,009
just get the money pretty cool concept

1197
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,880
so how do you implement blockchain and

1198
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:11,470
enterprise well it's a messy process and

1199
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,630
unfortunately that's because a lot of

1200
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:17,618
enterprises project plans kind of look

1201
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:19,630
like this so there are some really

1202
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:21,130
important fundamentals to focus on and

1203
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:24,339
we're actually talking about this

1204
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:26,319
earlier that you're a secure developer

1205
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:28,000
right you guys are security

1206
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:30,160
practitioners you understand the value

1207
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,619
and building things secure from the

1208
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,480
ground up blockchain is no different

1209
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:35,740
it's really really important to focus on

1210
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,390
the fundamentals and it's actually

1211
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,049
really difficult to do with watching it

1212
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:39,910
here's why

1213
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,140
a lot of times this is a controversial

1214
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,670
project that you're gonna put in a

1215
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,200
company maybe you've only got limited

1216
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,970
support you've got limited funding and

1217
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,069
so you as a person implementing this

1218
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:50,439
project are under a lot of pressure to

1219
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:51,849
show value really quickly a lot of

1220
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,869
quarters are cut a lot of people are

1221
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:55,150
doing whatever it is that they could

1222
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:56,530
possibly do to get their product up and

1223
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:57,910
running you get their prototype going

1224
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:59,260
and then up the prototypes built let's

1225
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:02,740
just throw some production data in there

1226
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,930
right not good practices and so what I

1227
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:07,680
would challenge you guys to do is be the

1228
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:11,078
voice of reason in your companies as

1229
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,390
which is not always easy to do depending

1230
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:15,430
on the nature of the company but as

1231
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,690
blockchain starts creeping in and as you

1232
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:18,460
start seeing these use cases be

1233
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,380
developed trying to around two people

1234
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,940
and say look there can be some merit to

1235
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,650
your idea I'm not saying anything

1236
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,140
otherwise but do not forget the

1237
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:30,010
fundamentals right we're only as weak as

1238
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:32,109
our weakest point here a lot of it comes

1239
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,609
down to basic secrets management and I

1240
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:35,348
don't mean to belittle secrets

1241
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:37,240
management by calling a basic because I

1242
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:40,059
understand that it is an entire field of

1243
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:42,098
study to which many people have devoted

1244
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:43,390
their entire lives but just like you'd

1245
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:45,460
manage secrets anywhere else in your

1246
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:47,020
organization you're watching is only as

1247
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,760
secure as its secrets and if you're

1248
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:51,009
relying on secret keys for people to be

1249
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,630
able to unlock functionality associated

1250
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,210
with the blockchain then your watching

1251
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:56,040
is only as secure as those

1252
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:58,050
people's ability to keep their secret

1253
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:01,230
key secret just like anything else that

1254
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:02,700
you'd see in your enterprise so what

1255
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:04,820
does it look like to stop the bad guys

1256
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,960
this might look familiar to you guys

1257
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,520
because this is pretty much what it

1258
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,420
takes to stop the bad guys everywhere

1259
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,580
else as well

1260
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,930
we're seeing that the same processes

1261
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:16,470
associated with securing the blockchain

1262
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,848
application are the same and that it

1263
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,049
would take to secure any other full

1264
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:20,580
stack application within our

1265
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:23,250
organization so you've got a heavy code

1266
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,839
review we do you know we add a crypto

1267
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,550
and math analysis in there as well we

1268
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:28,619
think that that's really important which

1269
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:30,390
seen some instances of people being able

1270
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:32,880
to pay themselves infinitely and crazy

1271
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:35,609
things like that so yeah half the math

1272
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,730
looked at by a math guy basic pentesting

1273
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:40,230
audit coverage you know inspect the full

1274
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,540
stack architectures make sure that it is

1275
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:45,810
really designed with security in mind

1276
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:47,250
and then build on existing tech so just

1277
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:49,320
because this is a new and innovative

1278
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,490
technology doesn't mean the whole thing

1279
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,500
has to be built with new and innovative

1280
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,029
technologies you know you're taking a

1281
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,490
big risk by implementing something like

1282
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:57,930
this perhaps why take such a big risk by

1283
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:00,180
implementing every single thing else

1284
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:01,980
that's unproven so you guys have certain

1285
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,118
technologies that you can trust that you

1286
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,010
can rely on that you know how to

1287
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,580
implement well keep that in mind as

1288
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:11,220
you're building out your architectures

1289
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:13,109
all right the final couple thoughts what

1290
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:16,500
is next for blockchain so these are a

1291
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:19,380
couple crazy headlines that we've seen

1292
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:22,260
so far most of them are associated with

1293
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,460
the legal problems with watching here in

1294
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,170
the United States but it really is

1295
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,609
global so I don't know if you guys

1296
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:29,220
realize this right now but the

1297
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:31,529
securitization of physical assets is

1298
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,720
largely illegal in the United States and

1299
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:35,460
so when we start talking about a

1300
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,129
platform that allows you to tokenize

1301
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,900
assets and shred them and loan them and

1302
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,520
borrow against them and all sorts of

1303
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,410
stuff like that it's actually illegal in

1304
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,570
a lot of places and it's a pretty big

1305
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:46,560
issue that can be destabilizing for a

1306
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,300
lot of companies that are trying to

1307
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,880
build in this space so right now there

1308
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,230
are I think it's 13 states in the US

1309
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,050
that have created what we call

1310
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:56,790
blockchain sandboxes basically they say

1311
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:58,650
up to a certain dollar amount we're

1312
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:00,180
going to allow you to do this stuff that

1313
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,509
would be illegal otherwise as far as

1314
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,219
tokenizing ass

1315
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:06,519
loaning against them and all sorts of

1316
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:07,779
stuff like that we will you know we're

1317
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:09,249
not going to turn a blind eye but we're

1318
00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:11,139
going to allow you to prove its business

1319
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:13,359
model while we start to understand the

1320
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:15,429
technology and we can legislate a little

1321
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:18,130
bit more so that's actually very

1322
00:47:15,429 --> 00:47:20,139
sensible approach it's a new fuel I know

1323
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,429
that there's some awesome blocking sand

1324
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:23,399
boxes out there both within the United

1325
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:26,949
States and outside the United States

1326
00:47:23,399 --> 00:47:28,569
Phoenix Arizona's a hot spot for that

1327
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:31,509
outside the United States the Isle of

1328
00:47:28,569 --> 00:47:33,909
Man is trying to become crypto island

1329
00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:35,529
which is pretty cool so they're they're

1330
00:47:33,909 --> 00:47:37,359
working on you know bringing all the

1331
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:38,679
cryptocurrency and all the the

1332
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,779
blockchain companies out there to try

1333
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:43,239
and improve their concepts so everyone

1334
00:47:40,779 --> 00:47:45,339
is really in this space race to try and

1335
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:46,869
be the place where it all happens but

1336
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:48,159
they're also not just completely opening

1337
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:51,539
up the books to let it all happen

1338
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,539
immediately so that's what's happening

1339
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:58,149
yes yeah so you're not always able to

1340
00:47:55,749 --> 00:48:00,129
just secure physical assets because if

1341
00:47:58,149 --> 00:48:01,118
securities are pretty heavily regulated

1342
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,489
right there's that there are a lot of

1343
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,739
things that you can abuse consumers and

1344
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:08,049
you know like monetary basis you know

1345
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:09,909
like securitization learning and

1346
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:11,649
borrowing can be a pretty destabilizing

1347
00:48:09,909 --> 00:48:14,529
force and there's a lot of opportunity

1348
00:48:11,649 --> 00:48:16,479
for abuse with them and so there are a

1349
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:18,399
whole lot of rules associated with that

1350
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:20,019
and what these come you know what these

1351
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:24,130
governments are doing is saying look you

1352
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:25,419
can loan up to $250,000 and we're I'm

1353
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,279
going to say a thing right it's okay for

1354
00:48:25,419 --> 00:48:28,899
you guys to load ups $200,000 now you

1355
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:31,269
guys are going to become billionaires by

1356
00:48:28,899 --> 00:48:32,618
loaning $200,000 but you're gonna prove

1357
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:34,089
that you're a viable business maybe you

1358
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:35,799
can go get your venture capital funding

1359
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:37,859
and while you're doing all that we're

1360
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:40,359
gonna see that you're not abusing people

1361
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:41,799
you know you're not taking advantage of

1362
00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:44,139
people who are is that is educated about

1363
00:48:41,799 --> 00:48:46,089
the technology or about the math and

1364
00:48:44,139 --> 00:48:47,529
that it's ultimately secure that this

1365
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:53,069
isn't going to collapse in some sort of

1366
00:48:47,529 --> 00:48:53,069
dreadful you know security incident

1367
00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:01,020
that's a terrific question you know a

1368
00:48:58,349 --> 00:49:02,400
lot of our research has been pretty

1369
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,880
fragmented in that we haven't really

1370
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,710
found a cohesive system of record where

1371
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,660
we could go in and to see the the

1372
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:12,780
current laws of you know the blockchain

1373
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:14,460
industry every where you go but one of

1374
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,780
our offerings and I you know I'm not

1375
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:18,240
here to talk about our offering is one

1376
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:20,910
of our offerings is to help people roll

1377
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,919
out their idea to a sandbox and so a lot

1378
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:25,470
of that does tie in the legal component

1379
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,869
of it and a legal technical and security

1380
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:30,240
you know we we expect them to own the

1381
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:31,710
business viability of it but it's a it's

1382
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,779
a tangled web right now and it's

1383
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:35,069
constantly evolving so even by the time

1384
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:39,300
you get a document and it seems to

1385
00:49:35,069 --> 00:49:50,550
change so it's unfortunately if the best

1386
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:53,940
answer I can give you yeah there's a big

1387
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:57,960
blockchain organization in Atlanta if

1388
00:49:53,940 --> 00:50:02,550
you find them I can talk to you

1389
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:10,050
afterwards and that would be the place

1390
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:11,880
to go in and find the contacts and it's

1391
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:14,760
actually yeah one of the coolest things

1392
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:17,250
about blockchain is the blockchain there

1393
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,300
are some amazing meetups around you know

1394
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:20,069
you get a lot of really passionate

1395
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,480
people in one direction or another it's

1396
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:23,550
a pretty fragmented right now across

1397
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,079
different technologies but the community

1398
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,730
has end up being pretty supportive of

1399
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:28,200
the concept in general they wanted to

1400
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:31,230
succeed they've just got very different

1401
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,810
passionate ideas of how the success will

1402
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:35,310
be executed but it's it's definitely

1403
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:38,490
been really neat to see I've got to go

1404
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:40,770
to some meetups around just some folks

1405
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:44,368
at different conferences and it is a

1406
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:45,210
supportive community so the future of

1407
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:47,940
blockchain

1408
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:49,619
where is the industry headed there were

1409
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,099
kind of three things that I've seen so

1410
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:52,319
far

1411
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:54,930
one is standardization so enterprises

1412
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,450
don't want to be the ones to implement a

1413
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:58,368
technology that ends up

1414
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:00,200
replaced by a different technology they

1415
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:02,300
don't know which horse to bet on and so

1416
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,819
we've heard this from a lot of c-level

1417
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:07,010
executives so far in the enterprise they

1418
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,230
say look we think that your ideas have

1419
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:11,510
merit we think that they can solve some

1420
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,490
of our problems but I'm also not going

1421
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,750
to give you a million dollars because I

1422
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:16,640
don't know if your technology is going

1423
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,020
to be around at six months totally

1424
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,490
legitimate problem and so what the

1425
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:21,619
industry is airing towards is

1426
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:23,240
standardization and a lot of the the

1427
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:26,570
blockchain platforms right now are

1428
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:28,729
teaming up in an awesome display of

1429
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:31,369
guapa tician to try and standardize a

1430
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:34,520
token format so that tokens can easily

1431
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:37,220
be transported across platforms and that

1432
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:39,440
might one day ease the overall

1433
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:40,970
standardization burden associated with

1434
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,410
rolling out a new technology but we see

1435
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:45,200
this with every technology right there's

1436
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:48,319
always a footrace to try to be the one

1437
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:51,290
who wins out it's a messy process but

1438
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,880
someone always ends up winning and it

1439
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:55,400
still hasn't happened yet though but

1440
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,890
we're getting closer scalability so I

1441
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:01,220
mentioned the energy consumption issue

1442
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:02,960
earlier on the fourteen point seven days

1443
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,910
of electricity that it takes to process

1444
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,859
every transaction that obviously has to

1445
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,328
be fixed and so a lot of the blockchain

1446
00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:11,210
platforms are implementing what they're

1447
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:13,130
calling level 2 solutions it's it's the

1448
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:15,680
idea that is can we take some of these

1449
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:18,740
transactions off train and still provide

1450
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,598
a degree of trust and so to just give

1451
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,520
you a brief understanding of how like

1452
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:25,190
one of those works so Bitcoin lightning

1453
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,770
for example says ok well there might be

1454
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:28,400
instances where two people are really

1455
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:30,079
transacting with each other pretty

1456
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:34,240
frequently there there isn't this lack

1457
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:37,369
of trust around completely so let's say

1458
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:40,310
Izzy and I are going to transact maybe

1459
00:52:37,369 --> 00:52:42,050
10 or 15 times over the next couple of

1460
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:43,490
days what we're going to do is we're

1461
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:45,140
going to write and sign each other

1462
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,399
transactions it would be like if I was

1463
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,839
writing her a cheque and she would write

1464
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,550
me a cheque back and I read her cheque

1465
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,109
and we never took him to the bank but we

1466
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:53,329
were just writing each other checks so

1467
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:55,549
we would fund this escrow account this

1468
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:57,470
smart contract we would write each other

1469
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:59,300
these checks and then when we decided ok

1470
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:01,220
our business relationship is terminated

1471
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,360
then we would settle it and that would

1472
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,589
be the ending balance

1473
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,230
actually get recorded on the blockchain

1474
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:07,850
so an interesting concept what that

1475
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:10,100
allows us for us to take a lot of the

1476
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:12,259
transactions off train off chain but

1477
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:14,569
still have trust in them it also brings

1478
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:17,360
a certain degree of privacy to the

1479
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:18,850
transacting because that way you don't

1480
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,750
know how many times Izzy and I

1481
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:22,160
transacted or what the exact dollar

1482
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,620
amounts were you just saw the ending

1483
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:28,490
balance which can be some some desirable

1484
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:30,290
privacy for folks so that it's a pretty

1485
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:32,060
cool concept definitely still not proven

1486
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,050
there they're in the development stage

1487
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:35,060
right now

1488
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:36,740
who knows if it will succeed or fail I

1489
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:39,650
know a theory ins got their own concept

1490
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:42,140
of it I think it's called plasma you

1491
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:43,280
might know the theory of plasma okay we

1492
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:44,720
have pretty sure it's called plasma

1493
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,590
either way though there's this whole

1494
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,879
conversation of second layer solutions

1495
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:51,800
to try and make the network more

1496
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,620
scalable and then finally and this is

1497
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,450
metallic you Terrans grand scheme his

1498
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:58,910
grand picture is interoperability he's

1499
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:00,500
the interoperability guy the tabut aaron

1500
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:03,200
was the 19 year old that invented

1501
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:05,630
aetherium and he's now I think he's 24

1502
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,240
25 pretty amazing guy absolutely

1503
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:10,130
brilliant and his whole vision is a

1504
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,770
series of block chains connected to each

1505
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:14,090
other and what that means is that you

1506
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:16,370
have to be able to do something like

1507
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:18,290
standardize a token so that if I you

1508
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:20,150
know if Izzy and I are transacting on

1509
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:21,650
one chain and then I want to go over

1510
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:23,180
here and I have this ending balance and

1511
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:25,010
I want to transact with her on a

1512
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,509
different chain I have to have the

1513
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:28,850
ability to do that and that requires a

1514
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:30,110
certain degree of standardization so

1515
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,520
that's those are kind of the three

1516
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:33,620
places where people seem to think that

1517
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,509
the industry is going and we'll just

1518
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,069
kind of see over the next year or two as

1519
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:38,870
these really unfold because some of this

1520
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:40,960
technologies will succeed some of them

1521
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:43,460
won't

1522
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:46,060
so I'll start to wrap up here I realize

1523
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:49,760
that I've got about five minutes so

1524
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:52,130
transformational potential is amazing

1525
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,170
for this technology it is not a silver

1526
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:56,510
bullet some barriers definitely need to

1527
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:58,940
be overcome before this is really going

1528
00:54:56,510 --> 00:55:00,890
to be able to realize its full potential

1529
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:03,200
I mentioned the scalability I mentioned

1530
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:05,270
the regulatory hurdles the immutability

1531
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,470
or the security component is definitely

1532
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:08,759
going to become a bigger and bigger

1533
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:12,600
talking point as

1534
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,980
technology matures overall this is

1535
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,140
restating the points from the beginning

1536
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:19,200
blockchain will not solve all of your

1537
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:21,569
problems but it does some things very

1538
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,770
very well it has the potential to

1539
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:24,660
disrupt a lot of different industries

1540
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:26,190
and as security practitioners you guys

1541
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,680
need to be prepared to advise your

1542
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:30,870
businesses accordingly and be that voice

1543
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,460
of reason to say look there is some

1544
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:35,759
merit to what you want to do here but do

1545
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,960
not forget the fundamentals here are

1546
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,300
some of the value propositions that we

1547
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:42,810
talked about and you know the key one

1548
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:44,610
being that it can help prove the truth

1549
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:46,740
it's this really important concept right

1550
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:49,850
now so I'll go back to this quote that I

1551
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:54,709
opened with you guys taught me all right

1552
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:58,020
he didn't say this but yeah busted shoot

1553
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:59,490
it's not always this easy though think

1554
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:02,040
about everything that you guys have seen

1555
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:03,839
in the press all this become a hotfoot

1556
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:07,740
but an issue right now the whole concept

1557
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:09,740
of big news it is becoming more and more

1558
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:13,470
difficult for people to understand

1559
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:15,540
fiction from reality and it's it's like

1560
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:18,209
a it's almost a battle of good versus

1561
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:20,550
evil in a sense because it's a very

1562
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:22,260
difficult issue right now especially and

1563
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,880
we're stuck in the paradigm of the

1564
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,520
Internet of information where things can

1565
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:29,850
be so easily fabricated and disseminated

1566
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:32,310
without validation but what blockchain

1567
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:36,569
really does is help resolve this chasm

1568
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:38,580
that exists between truth and trust and

1569
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:40,200
like I said it's probably not a silver

1570
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:42,390
bullet there are a lot of other things

1571
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,160
that have to happen before we can stop

1572
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:45,960
the spread of fake news or before we can

1573
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,220
solve all the other world's problems but

1574
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,560
the way I see it this is a fantastic

1575
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:51,629
tool that puts us one step in the right

1576
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,130
direction so guys thank you very much

1577
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,510
for your time and your patience I

1578
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:56,910
definitely appreciate it I hope you guys

1579
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:59,090
have a fantastic conference and a great

1580
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:04,038
rest of your week

1581
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:04,039
[Applause]
