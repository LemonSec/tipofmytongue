1
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:06,580
hopefully everybody got some good talks

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:12,250
and today learned a lot of new things

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:13,929
right awesome so this talk is going to

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,259
be a little bit of a departure from what

5
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:18,570
I talked about are the types of things

6
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:21,100
typically it's a little more technical

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:25,269
this is going to be what's more focused

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:30,990
on the privacy aspect and aspect of

9
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:33,040
owning smart devices or using services

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,410
so the title of this talk

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,140
Alexa knows my kids better than I do I

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,328
think it kind of sums up the state of

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,860
devices today I really you know just

14
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:44,860
just they're invasive as when they're

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,379
pervasiveness into our daily lives and

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,260
I'm gonna go back through that course

17
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:52,059
here in just a minute

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,430
other than what has been introduced

19
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:54,760
already I am a husband and father of

20
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,949
four

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:01,120
I am also known as the Eco manager of

22
00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:02,769
household operations at my own I work

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,239
for security and in solutions as

24
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,250
mentioned and I mainly deal with

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,990
enterprise security monitoring solutions

26
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,909
so helping people to stand up

27
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,759
oh space intrusion detection systems

28
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:15,460
network-based intrusion detection log

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,680
management types of stuff like that so I

30
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,169
love doing that stuff however this of

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,900
course again is a nice departure from

32
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,790
that I love coffee and I have to have

33
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,950
coffee in the morning please I'm talking

34
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,270
if I have to have it and I've had it and

35
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,460
I

36
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,439
security software enthusiasts which

37
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,759
means I love going through you know just

38
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:35,169
like security and it's completely

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,659
open-source I love going through and

40
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,460
other tools that can be abused to

41
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:45,189
enterprises and really trying to tie

42
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:47,649
those together to make them effective so

43
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:50,500
again our world today there's really a

44
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:52,780
complex assortment of devices everywhere

45
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,299
you look everywhere you go you're either

46
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,990
being recorded somebody or someone's

47
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:01,450
listening to you and these devices a lot

48
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,640
of them you know their roles really are

49
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,560
as an assistant presence so a digital

50
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,919
assistant may be that help with

51
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,509
collaboration with coworkers or maybe

52
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,700
just for entertainment purposes right we

53
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:16,089
wanted to tell us a joke or when in your

54
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:19,268
song things of that nature so being a

55
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,830
parent and really just a human being in

56
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:23,739
general this damage is kind of scary

57
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,709
because of all these things again so

58
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:29,500
many things to interact with and so much

59
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:32,859
data capture and really stored outside

60
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,859
of our control or we don't know if it's

61
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:41,310
been duplicated and elsewhere just lots

62
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:41,310
of things to consider devices services

63
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:50,350
so Alexa in general most of you probably

64
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:51,790
know what Alexa is already there's

65
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,680
anybody here in having it at Alyssa

66
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,980
enable device in their own they're

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,980
currently using

68
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:03,180
oh so in a nutshell just a virtual

69
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,670
assistant developed by Amazon super

70
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,700
popular these days uses a natural

71
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,640
language processing to go do things for

72
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,989
you and remember results and it

73
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,459
ultimately it just provides that

74
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,770
capability for automation and

75
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,930
convenience right so just allowing you

76
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,640
to go do stuff like setting a timer

77
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,130
playing a song or something else

78
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,109
I'm just hopefully saving you time and

79
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:32,280
giving you some benefit out of that

80
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:35,580
process now there are a ton of a lesson

81
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:39,660
enabled devices you can see a few here

82
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,160
of course the echo echo dot show and of

83
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,260
course they're integrated into other

84
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,970
third parties like neck get your saw

85
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,769
hardware I'm sorry GE so smart switches

86
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,080
smart outlets all sorts of stuff even

87
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:56,670
devices running Windows 10 can use Alexa

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,770
along with Cortana so once again it

89
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,500
gives you a lot of capability at really

90
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,330
Amazon a lot of capability to peer into

91
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,060
your life and the lives of your family

92
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:14,160
to see what's going on see what you're

93
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:15,750
doing a few stats so right here some of

94
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,440
these are from different time periods

95
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,200
but it was really the most it's credible

96
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,120
that I can find so twenty thousand

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,090
number was the number of unique devices

98
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,590
on which Alexa is available right so

99
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,359
you're talking about across hardware

100
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,419
manufacturers you're talking about

101
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,860
different models and stuff like that and

102
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:38,130
the number of skills available so those

103
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,080
skills typically refer to you know

104
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,770
something Alexa can do of his service

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,770
reaching out to us

106
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:50,620
and then finally 100 million there are a

107
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:53,349
hundred million devices running Alexa in

108
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,499
general her sold at least to the public

109
00:04:53,349 --> 00:05:05,529
today and that was at the end of q4 of

110
00:04:56,499 --> 00:05:07,029
18 so they're obviously way out so how

111
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:09,539
it works in a nutshell and this is an

112
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:13,689
extremely technical at all so please

113
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:16,240
forgive any technical inaccuracies but

114
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:18,460
in general lessons waiting on a wait

115
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,189
word right so it's waiting on you to

116
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,659
give it that hot where it's a traitor

117
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:26,710
and do its thing so it's always

118
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:27,969
listening you know like locator and I'll

119
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,120
show you that the device is listening

120
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:33,159
and we store the echo devices and it

121
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,080
will go off once you say that hot word

122
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:37,599
and that word and then it will go off to

123
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:42,938
the cloud servers it'll say hey what you

124
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:44,800
got for me yeah but either way you know

125
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:46,419
once it's received it once is triggered

126
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,550
that hot word the surface are gonna

127
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:50,859
store that possible yeah always

128
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,229
recording and then they're gonna try to

129
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,969
if you have the development features

130
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,758
enabled their automatic they're going to

131
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:59,020
try to train Alexa with that and they're

132
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,419
just gonna store it indefinitely on

133
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:05,438
their servers unless you go mess with it

134
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:07,270
or review it so once again once it gets

135
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,279
back to those results its visit out to

136
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,889
you and either understood what you said

137
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:18,339
or it didn't and you know you get

138
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:22,599
something back yourself also how it

139
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:25,749
works in a nutshell this sounds like

140
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,819
wait word right and I think it happens

141
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:29,870
all too often with with many folks and

142
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:32,960
and I'll talking about a little bit more

143
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,130
second but something else you know this

144
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,609
is a man record in this ticker

145
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:41,360
conversation nice is like don't worry it

146
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:43,970
is and then the clown says once again

147
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,560
let's store it so they still store the

148
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:49,220
data even though it wasn't a valid

149
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,900
request and then alexinnz comes back

150
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:56,090
won't respond the board of the study

151
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:57,560
that doesn't know what it is so it's

152
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,289
it's something to keep in mind that not

153
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,670
only it is valid requests you know it's

154
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,620
listening in for that WIC word and not

155
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,540
only this reality of was that provide

156
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,910
the WIC word but ones that sound

157
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,790
acoustically similar and they'll be able

158
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,410
to effectively discern it and you know

159
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:19,580
that's it's gonna be a flaw with the

160
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:22,700
software in general so once again a wait

161
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,280
word is not always awake word mistakes

162
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,680
happen everybody knows computers are

163
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,150
hard

164
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,280
humans are not perfect no where are the

165
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,190
machines that they intend to perfect

166
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,950
right so an imperfect human can I create

167
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,230
a perfect machine therefore we have to

168
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,270
expect some mistakes are gonna occur and

169
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:44,110
some day is gonna be collected when it

170
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,109
was not inside too

171
00:07:49,720 --> 00:08:05,120
and here's Chuck Norris just kicking a

172
00:07:52,310 --> 00:08:07,820
negative doctors all right so they've

173
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:13,190
collected Emma's on collects a lot of

174
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:16,280
data now just general I'm going to that

175
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,830
but through the alexa service it's

176
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,409
really trying to provide it's extending

177
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:25,190
to that service to provide 360-degree

178
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:27,460
view of yourself to amazon and this is

179
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:31,160
all really for Amazon to of course

180
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:34,250
potentially make more money they're

181
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,650
trying to do a profile of you right so a

182
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,000
lot of times when when folks think about

183
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,220
you know they're taking my data and

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,590
simply solo to third parties and stuff

185
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,140
like this it's not necessarily the case

186
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,870
with Amazon or they like the service

187
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,080
it's much more valuable for them to have

188
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,390
your data and be able to use that data

189
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,700
and have exclusively since I believe it

190
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:59,470
was seventy-five percent of most folks

191
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,470
doing online shopping done it

192
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,460
so they definitely want that information

193
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:12,120
they don't want to give that away so

194
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:14,040
easily so some of the data that it

195
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,640
collects is with regards to language

196
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,880
right so our vocabulary the words that

197
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,720
we use right so people with different

198
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,470
upbringing as may use different

199
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,210
vocabulary you know people just people

200
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,980
in general right just depending on their

201
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,740
education level or their personal

202
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,200
preferences and it seeks to understand

203
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,530
that to better training service all

204
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,260
right

205
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,670
so it's taking that voice recording and

206
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,650
everything that it's learning from you

207
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,439
and analyzing all those words that you

208
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:46,709
say in addition your speech patterns so

209
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,830
maybe your cadence right so the way that

210
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:52,230
I am talking now it may see things like

211
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:56,430
that and better learn to process speech

212
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,930
with pauses or things like that so there

213
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,209
are a lot of different ways that it

214
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,729
processes work it interprets your

215
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:04,880
language to better people to you in the

216
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,880
future

217
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,030
so personal preferences honestly a lot

218
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,190
of you know websites or services do this

219
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,380
but again this is you know using the

220
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,440
service it's again another entry point

221
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:23,010
to providing that data and compiling a

222
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,540
profile the deadline floor so it might

223
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,640
be John there's a music for which you're

224
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,189
searching specific artists things like

225
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,840
that it might be types of venues for you

226
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,930
know if you're looking they go out drink

227
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,670
have a buy a pizza things like that and

228
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,670
of course maybe styles of clothing that

229
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:41,160
you purchase you know what which would

230
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:44,510
make some where it's all looking at

231
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,510
these different things trying to go to

232
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,580
and once again that's kind of guys in

233
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,100
hand sorry in a hand in hand with the

234
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,660
personal preferences of course a lot of

235
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,399
those personal preferences are going to

236
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,819
be tied to certain buying habits right

237
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,329
so well people may not always act on

238
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,070
approaches you know from searching for

239
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:08,420
these different items and they're still

240
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,680
gonna track the types of things that

241
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,839
we're buying the brands of things that

242
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,540
you're buying how often you're buying it

243
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,190
are there certain intervals they buy so

244
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,899
maybe they can recommend or they can

245
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,510
fold in some type of discount later

246
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:29,420
based on your buying habits right it's

247
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:33,649
all for that whole money dollar some

248
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:37,750
other data so if you have any Smart

249
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:41,630
Switches right and they smartly outlets

250
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:44,240
house fixtures lamps still like that so

251
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,029
like thermostats that use Alexa and echo

252
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,390
B or something it's going to store all

253
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:52,130
of that as well so if we get status

254
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:55,310
indicators from that various details

255
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:58,640
from those devices right and it's gonna

256
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:05,119
store all that and once again with your

257
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:06,800
other activity once again I just want to

258
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,890
reiterate on the voice recordings that

259
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,959
Alexa I'm sorry the Amazon storing

260
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,790
through this device of service you have

261
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:17,000
this clips of audio that are stored from

262
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,880
successful and unsuccessful attempts so

263
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,350
again that's something to keep in mind

264
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,250
and these are really stored indefinitely

265
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,690
unless they go out proving them because

266
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,089
I'm you know there's no need to give her

267
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,720
that data and rolling

268
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:35,790
some of that that marketing power or

269
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,790
appeal then they won't do it

270
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:48,309
and by the way I'm not trying to make it

271
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:50,499
in the house and that guy so today to

272
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:54,189
review are you - sing this in the news

273
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:56,860
recently it came out most popular has no

274
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:58,748
last few days but Amazon actually

275
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,610
employs a lot of people that look at

276
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:02,079
these voice recordings they're

277
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,050
essentially trained to go through and

278
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,449
look at these and help train the Alexa

279
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:10,029
service to better utilize his voice

280
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:13,449
recordings and interpret them so it

281
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:15,249
helps them to transcribe that the

282
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:18,219
workers health and scientists yeah

283
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:20,649
transcribe that information and when I

284
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,019
mentioned that loaded details are paired

285
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:25,269
with these recordings I still feel like

286
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:27,040
an account number a person a mana device

287
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:28,629
serial number are still not something

288
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,269
that I would want associate it was a

289
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:33,429
recording and I would think that it's

290
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,649
still not that difficult to correlate

291
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:36,850
that with user identity right either

292
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,679
through another customer service

293
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,410
representative or some other access that

294
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:45,100
that boy had I said that I think it's me

295
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,779
a little pause and once again recordings

296
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,689
even consist of private conversations

297
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:50,769
singing in the shower I children the

298
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:51,759
crying for help

299
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:55,029
you know maybe they got a boo-boo and

300
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,439
they're asking for dad my mom are you in

301
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:58,800
criminal activity right I mean it's

302
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,800
anything

303
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:08,540
so a few kicks is in the news I

304
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:10,009
mentioned that they announced the the

305
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,410
workers that I was analyzing the

306
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:15,230
recordings but there's also another case

307
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,559
so State vs Timothy barrel this was a

308
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:21,139
double murder case in which an echo

309
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,730
device was present and the judge

310
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:23,809
actually ordered the recordings to be

311
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,419
turned over to the state of New

312
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:30,019
Hampshire you know this is something

313
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:31,819
that we're gonna see then and again time

314
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:34,129
and time again as his devices

315
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:36,229
proliferate in people's homes I'm gonna

316
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:38,119
see potentially turned over to

317
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,209
government for some sort of purpose or

318
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:43,309
effort to either prove or disprove a

319
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:45,589
crime right

320
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:48,919
another case James based in Arkansas was

321
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:50,269
another suspected murder of colleague it

322
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:52,100
was eventually dropped the charges were

323
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:54,499
he actually voluntarily handed over

324
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,790
their horns though in that case you know

325
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:57,350
it might have actually helped him that

326
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,529
he had that and it disproved their

327
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,119
hypothesis or at least I did not give

328
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:04,910
any credence to you know there are other

329
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:05,989
arguments and also a family in Portland

330
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,449
Oregon you might have heard about this

331
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:11,709
one they were talking about some of our

332
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:14,329
wood floors just chilling at home and

333
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:16,368
for some reason right now they're Alexa

334
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:19,699
thought they wanted to initiate

335
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:21,559
interaction with Alexa and then that

336
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:23,868
private conversation actually got sent

337
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:26,809
to one of the husband's contacts with

338
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:29,929
one of the workers as employees so

339
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:32,719
there's definitely some stuff there that

340
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:34,160
once again kind of gives me pause and I

341
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:41,620
struggle with this

342
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:46,969
because of things like this ultimately

343
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:51,920
it's about trust right we are trusting

344
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:53,450
Amazon to protect our data as well as

345
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,270
our children's data whenever they're

346
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:59,300
recording this right and the best

347
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:01,760
assurance that we have is the thing or

348
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,609
are the things that they tell us through

349
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,400
public announcements through the terms

350
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,020
of use on the website through the

351
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,520
privacy settings that we enable are

352
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:15,470
disabled and that's really all we know

353
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:18,020
unless there's some some big breach

354
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,420
right where it comes out that you know

355
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:23,990
some things were handled as we thought

356
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:29,479
they were so that's really all we have

357
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:34,690
is trust we can trust them but honestly

358
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,690
we have nobody to verify the verify

359
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:43,279
and I want to talk about kids so

360
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:46,700
obviously I you guys know kids know a

361
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,490
lot of Technology at school right and I

362
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,110
rides with a lot of Technology so you

363
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,410
know there's computer-based learning all

364
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:56,560
this stem right all these activities

365
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,969
that are allowing kids to interact with

366
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,300
you know different services and

367
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,560
different concepts and it's important

368
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,349
that we really teach some of these

369
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,688
things well and I'll get to that in just

370
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,678
a minute and of course at home right

371
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,559
other technology and entertainment

372
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,990
purposes like YouTube Facebook my plate

373
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,020
for tonight minecraft roblox that my

374
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:21,589
kids have tech knowledge is not

375
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:26,449
necessarily a bad thing just with adults

376
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:28,399
profiles so Amazon all sorts of people

377
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:31,370
and that services are leveraging those

378
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,580
profiles and data points to market and

379
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,870
appeal to various folks right and that's

380
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,600
one thing that we have to keep in mind

381
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,399
as parents how our kids interact with

382
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,480
that how what kind of profile they're

383
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,820
gonna have published by the time they're

384
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,030
18 already nothing interacted with these

385
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,030
services

386
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:55,190
and profiles right so profiles really

387
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:57,440
consist of hundreds sometimes thousands

388
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,179
of data points just depends really on

389
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,670
what aspects of these services that you

390
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:03,410
interact with another gathered through

391
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,740
various interactions there's personal

392
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:09,890
details that spoke up before are all

393
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,960
garnered into this profile and simply

394
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:16,040
those profiles are paired with things

395
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,900
like predictive analytics right so some

396
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,120
make decisions basically about how it's

397
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,750
going to market to users what's going to

398
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,580
appeal to them and things of that nature

399
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:28,309
right and these profiles may even yield

400
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:31,549
the tales that maybe parents don't know

401
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:34,399
about their kids right how they've

402
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:36,379
interacted with service details that

403
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,210
derailleur conversation or regular

404
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:42,140
interaction us as human beings would not

405
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:45,110
know so it's very important that we are

406
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,429
aware of that activity and you know just

407
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,990
just thinking about that kind in the

408
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:50,270
back your head what kind of profile are

409
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,790
you said how worried your children or

410
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:55,059
profile I think I have when they're

411
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,059
older

412
00:18:57,109 --> 00:19:02,188
again use of technology with limited

413
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,759
knowledge or awareness can be dangerous

414
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:07,889
it can cause unintended consequences

415
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:10,259
right and I promise I don't have the

416
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:11,248
tempo hat on I'm just trying to kind of

417
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:13,219
keep you yeah

418
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:15,569
just thinking about these things and

419
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:17,219
potential long-term irrevocable effects

420
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:23,549
right everything that we put on the

421
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:26,939
internet it's there forever right and

422
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:30,509
this activity or you know this limited

423
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:33,059
use is really propagated through social

424
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:35,849
norms right it's normal to use Facebook

425
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:39,989
right it's normal to use Alexa it's

426
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:41,609
normal to do all of these things so I'll

427
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:43,199
talk a little bit about that so social

428
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:45,779
norms really what are they they're

429
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:47,489
unwritten rules a behavior acceptable

430
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:49,859
anywhere in society and you have various

431
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:51,599
types of course both ways more instead

432
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:53,908
boobs won't getting that into that too

433
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,489
much but they essentially exist to

434
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:59,039
provide order and society and really

435
00:19:56,489 --> 00:20:01,409
it's important for us to as human beings

436
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,349
to be effective in society to conform to

437
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:07,639
the contract need to be an effective

438
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:11,158
member of our society and in the past

439
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:15,529
expectation of privacy was always social

440
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,529
norm right so it's just a given

441
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:21,629
so going with a bit more on social norms

442
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:23,428
they're driven by advancements and

443
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:24,839
technology so things like watching even

444
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:27,419
throwing the stranger things playing for

445
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,039
that again or utilizing smart devices in

446
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:32,609
general these are become social norms

447
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:36,869
for us right norm to trade that

448
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:39,619
convenience so what happens if we don't

449
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,619
conform to these social

450
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:47,340
yeah yeah privacy either that right so

451
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:50,730
we can lighten men you mean we don't

452
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:54,000
have to use these do you mean it's not

453
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:56,070
that much of a benefit to use these but

454
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,950
I'm still giving away all this privacy I

455
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,990
don't think I want to do that so I mean

456
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,360
there could be enlightenment right it's

457
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:06,750
not always the case

458
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:09,209
there could be alien Asian I can cause a

459
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,340
decrease in confidence anxiety or

460
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,230
increase things I think and it can

461
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,928
affect relationships right like we

462
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,399
secure the Grandma's house anymore

463
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:20,669
yeah we've talked to her over the echo

464
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:27,149
show ok so how does that affect your

465
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:29,039
relationship and then also affecting

466
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:30,449
change so it offers a new perspective

467
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,340
you know folks that don't want you see

468
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,039
these devices but it requires the cool

469
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,149
clear second support and really early

470
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,769
you know being a stakeholder and really

471
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:41,100
supporting me through that and affecting

472
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:44,070
other people so what happens if we can

473
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,719
form when we need to cookies right we

474
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:50,580
have a natural desire to conform to peer

475
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:52,260
pressure and group judgment so we have

476
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,918
to set that loss of privacy which really

477
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,240
isn't immediately quantifiable and only

478
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,820
at the seats of the use of the Alexus

479
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,950
service can we really begin to I guess

480
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,320
calculate and not really to a finite

481
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:08,340
degree the effects of what's been

482
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,049
reported or what we've provided so once

483
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,779
again I'm running low on side we're

484
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:13,760
mishandling exposure I'm sorry there's

485
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:16,430
the potential for

486
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,720
and when your exposure there so we can't

487
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,780
trust that it's always going to be

488
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,320
handled correctly even though this is

489
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:27,950
and we're always training convenience

490
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,610
over prices is demanding here is that

491
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:34,910
we're giving them bits of data so that

492
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:39,590
we can go set a timer for an egg right

493
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:41,480
and they can make mad cash and that's

494
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,970
just I mean yes there are certain

495
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:50,900
certain benefit but it's just really you

496
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:53,480
know it depends on that so we can take

497
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,120
that control don't take steps right so

498
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,790
we can have a proactive approach and a

499
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,050
lot of that's really built into in Lund

500
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,460
settings themselves they've done a good

501
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,360
job of that I just think they could do a

502
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:07,310
better job of publicizing it right

503
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,780
making it more well known so there's an

504
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:13,850
interface there the Alexa privacy

505
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:15,020
okay sure all right and so then we can

506
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,449
actually see the voice history all the

507
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,010
voice recordings that Alexa has ever

508
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,470
recorded right

509
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:23,090
Alexa I'd like to watch the office

510
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,500
here's what I've found so it transcribed

511
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,600
that one right there because it's not

512
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,220
what I was talking about but this one up

513
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,389
here I didn't know what I was talking

514
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:34,850
about I was talking to my kids so it's

515
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,410
definitely important to review this type

516
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,510
of information I think on a regular

517
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,630
basis let's make sure that you know

518
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:45,770
there aren't in unintended consequences

519
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:47,660
there and once again the smart alert

520
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,940
history if you've got smart devices you

521
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:53,250
can see all that type of stuff here I'm

522
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:56,460
sorry like you know the switches and

523
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:58,900
outlets and things of that nature

524
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,960
even smoke and CO two Testaments right

525
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,570
and then this is really gonna be the

526
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,490
more general third-party home devices in

527
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,439
which you interact with where you can

528
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:11,770
delete the history there so it's also

529
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,090
another cool point and also to school

530
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,800
permissions you can limit the

531
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,810
permissions or at least you can review

532
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,570
them on here so each skill that you're

533
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:23,649
using you can see what permissions they

534
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:25,450
have in this various types of data and

535
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,520
finally I mentioned this earlier but the

536
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,170
feature development you can actually

537
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,760
disable participation on this and they

538
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:33,310
will not be reviewing your recordings

539
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,170
although they may still hand select some

540
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,629
of them from time to time they will not

541
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:42,310
go through that same procurement process

542
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:45,700
or that same review process and another

543
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:47,470
protection just muted right so it's

544
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,180
simple but effective you know you have

545
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:53,170
to go over there and what press apply

546
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:56,440
right but a trade convene surprises and

547
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:58,780
what's a DV trusted yeah yeah do you

548
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,850
trust it too and once you meet it do you

549
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:07,660
trust it right you trusted is actually

550
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:10,090
music all right all right or just play

551
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:18,580
it all together right no power there

552
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:23,699
were problems but but really what's the

553
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:26,379
point if you're on blame right if if you

554
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,150
you know it's just it really it takes

555
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,080
you know a certain expectation you just

556
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,030
have to have that hand in hand

557
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,040
expectation of privacy right like wait a

558
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:36,730
minute wouldn't even up could be nice

559
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,350
wise what's that yeah shooting you can't

560
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:42,400
she can't go to the fire

561
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:44,840
certainly yeah

562
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,060
but you know real quick just some

563
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,659
alternatives I just wanted to mention

564
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:52,580
not to try to sell people on not getting

565
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,230
a lesson in with devices but they're all

566
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,050
are open-source all turns out there

567
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:59,570
they'll actually store the data locally

568
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:02,240
and not send it off and you can do this

569
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:05,000
on your own Raspberry Pi as well and I

570
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,530
think West Widener and his talk

571
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,050
sound of evil actually talks about this

572
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,970
a little bit and he mentions this next

573
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,070
thing I'm going to talk about but yeah

574
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,510
Mycroft is that company pretty cool I

575
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:29,090
haven't done yet but definitely

576
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:32,450
interested in you have the mark one okay

577
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:33,560
some thinking the consideration so the

578
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,170
other thing I was gonna talk about is

579
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,060
project alias have you seen project

580
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,560
Davis at all no okay so this is

581
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,870
essentially again kind of a Raspberry Pi

582
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,580
type thing and a 3d printer thing where

583
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:46,429
you can sign it all together and you're

584
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:49,340
creating essentially a hat or a mask for

585
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:52,280
this and then it's going to sit on top

586
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:54,139
of there and it basically you know

587
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,389
intercepts any requests to that

588
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:06,370
microphone right so you're essentially a

589
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:06,370
listing in that divot yeah sure

590
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,980
all right so so yeah you know and and

591
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,120
again like I said what's wider to the

592
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,520
tail is this a little more technically

593
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,790
in his talk so I definitely check that

594
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,740
out

595
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,629
he's on YouTube he's done said what

596
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,100
besides and he was just that this piece

597
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,050
out today in the same talk so it's a

598
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:35,340
very good pretty good song I encourage

599
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:36,389
you to check it out but other than that

600
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,669
I will leave you some additional

601
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,950
resources really just the Alexa Terms of

602
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,080
Use and privacy settings I think are

603
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,090
just a big helping themselves just what

604
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,030
they're already publishing for you

605
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,500
howa manages data and of course West

606
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:52,760
winding down here checking out his talk

607
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,760
there's this Twitter handle right there

608
00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:00,179
[Applause]

609
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:07,500
alright alright and that is it contact

610
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,850
you can reach me on Twitter hit me up at

611
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,850
the real W Lambert

612
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,889
[Applause]
