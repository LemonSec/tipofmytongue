1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,630
okay welcome to this sound over the

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,280
whole West right here he's an

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,800
engineering manager at CrowdStrike you

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,018
know you'll be going over the sound of

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,029
evoking various aspects of audience

6
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:18,220
degree this one take time to thank our

7
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:19,500
sponsors here at V Sox from the Kennesaw

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,259
State Department of Information Systems

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:37,629
like to thank the NSA and for spirit of

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:40,510
help systems so without further due so

11
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,670
the sound to be talking about audio

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:46,510
security but before again I just want to

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,820
take like a whole what attracted you to

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,640
come to this talk several others that

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,559
are going on some really good so what do

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,780
you think of when you think of all your

17
00:00:53,559 --> 00:01:00,959
security I have two surveillance

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:11,939
surveillance

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:11,939
yeah privacy privacy all right so

20
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,270
basically I made it up there's no such

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,789
thing as audio security but there should

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,329
be now the reason why there should be is

23
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:27,390
because audio systems are coming in in

24
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:29,579
all kinds of places right they show up

25
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,979
everybody and I would argue that this is

26
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,348
something that's really just in it's

27
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:38,369
like very beginning phases they're not

28
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:40,890
going away if you go back in like in

29
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,780
computing history the ability to just

30
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,840
talk to your computer is something

31
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,179
that's like baked in like all the way

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,789
through our our size how did people

33
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:55,739
interact with like kidfox you know the

34
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:58,200
the car the nightlife talk to it how did

35
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:01,560
we interact with data awesome Star Trek

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,959
talk talk like this is baked in and then

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,170
all the way through to like there's a

38
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,940
really old ad for Apple where they

39
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,910
started off pretty the name of the

40
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,650
system but the whole ad is talking to

41
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,859
the Macintosh and having it do things

42
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,049
now the ad was was not completely

43
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:22,799
far-fetched they had a little bit of

44
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:24,989
things even the old new device from

45
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:27,690
Apple II many years ago you could at

46
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:31,349
least tell it to set a date so the

47
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:35,340
ability to interact with a computer it's

48
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:39,268
like really old promise and why did it

49
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,130
all of a sudden like so only recently

50
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:42,750
have all these other pieces come

51
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,180
together for it to become like something

52
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,069
that

53
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:50,319
dude today so in with that as a good

54
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,089
security researcher you should think

55
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,078
about like what are the ways that this

56
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,959
this device can be misused and used and

57
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:02,049
also the privacy issues everything else

58
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:05,019
so most people will they think of all

59
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:06,819
your security or audio devices voice

60
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,930
assistants think about the physical

61
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:13,018
special-purpose

62
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:17,379
voice assistive device the Amazon echoes

63
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:21,310
the Google dies and then not really

64
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:24,129
special purpose but a Siri speaker or

65
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:29,530
actually the avatar the Apple speaker

66
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:45,819
which had Siri pregnant but then there's

67
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:47,500
a whole bunch of others to the they're

68
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:49,958
really just they really just constitute

69
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,599
like microphones some thin processing

70
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,079
and then a speaker of some sort that's

71
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,040
it

72
00:03:53,079 --> 00:04:00,190
and then IOT side of it they're actually

73
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,709
the best case of IOT they have

74
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:05,159
end-to-end encryption the firmwares

75
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:09,250
locked down there was one version of the

76
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:11,978
Amazon echo that had the very first

77
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,830
version you could tag onto the board and

78
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:15,810
then get root access that's how we

79
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,690
they're they're based off of an Android

80
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,670
operating system and they have apks that

81
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:25,230
are installed you don't install any of

82
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:27,510
the case Amazon but other than that the

83
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:32,040
device is really locked down there's not

84
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,960
a whole lot else going on there so what

85
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,450
else is there that we can talk about I

86
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,450
want to introduce the idea of voice

87
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,880
assistance is being disembodied think

88
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,979
about Star Trek where you're walking

89
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,960
along the bridge you talk to the

90
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:50,280
computer do this thing right

91
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,289
that is a voices system and there

92
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,739
they're not just limited to the physical

93
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,020
device that the device is really just a

94
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,090
pic report for you to say you know

95
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,159
here's the device or here's the

96
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,450
capabilities but the capabilities are

97
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,340
built into a whole bunch of other things

98
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:10,530
like carbs phones remotes all over the

99
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,940
place they're showing on public areas

100
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:17,190
are starting to have like a voice

101
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:20,190
assistant approach to so um they're even

102
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,600
showing up in like channel systems for

103
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:26,040
those of you who aren't aware chat ups

104
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,780
are like taking a chat type system like

105
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,030
slack and being able to interact with

106
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,219
your corporate town or Jenkins or some

107
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,679
other servers and then adding a voice

108
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:40,260
overlay to it just tell me why it's go

109
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:43,050
build this in other words they're used

110
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,360
more and more as shortcuts for helping

111
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,950
us do things that we want to do there's

112
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,430
all kinds of apps that are built on the

113
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:53,760
phone where you can like

114
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,760
your voice like triggers to do things

115
00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:02,020
Siri used to be known as happy

116
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,700
interesting side until the marketing

117
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,440
team thankfully came along and said

118
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:12,010
don't really want to sell a product and

119
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:21,790
how to people but the idea that like I

120
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:24,340
think it's kind of a series anybody

121
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,270
familiar with how you might not from

122
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,719
when you're sorry I should've done it

123
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:36,760
neighbor not familiar with that 2001

124
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:38,800
Space Odyssey either recommend that

125
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,000
because that is one of a original like

126
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,640
sounds people

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,230
it's where the I'm sorry comes from yeah

128
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,900
he ends up boxing the guy out his face

129
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,580
and tries to kill him right yeah which

130
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,530
is why he's saying into the house it's

131
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:59,590
not a good idea to name your right voice

132
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:01,690
so one thing that we can save like

133
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,580
generalized over voice assistance is

134
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,770
that the Platonic ideal and we're

135
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,770
talking about like ideal forms for a

136
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,690
voice assistant is really a combination

137
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,969
of three different machine learning

138
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,280
models and I know machine learning might

139
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,009
give you some heartburn it's used in all

140
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,558
kinds of

141
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:21,919
context whatever but this is really the

142
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:24,169
reason why my voice assistants are

143
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,389
popular now and they work popular when

144
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:29,990
they were first conceived that can like

145
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:32,419
even the 50s the bells Bell systems had

146
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,029
something called the Audrey system that

147
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:36,830
was trying to detect numbers that was

148
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:38,990
all it was really designed to do but it

149
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:43,159
was a sort of a primitive voice to speak

150
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:47,270
voice to text other bit of trivia there

151
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:49,069
the the person who created Tetris was he

152
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,080
used to work for the KGB before he came

153
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,759
to the US and he said one of his

154
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,460
projects there was to be able to speak

155
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,379
to the big fighter plane and like the

156
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,198
pilot would be able to tell it to do

157
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:03,159
things because at high G maneuvers it's

158
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:07,219
harder to move your arms but the sound

159
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:10,099
you know sound waves travel at like 700

160
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:12,229
miles an hour so you can tell the plane

161
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:14,659
to do something you never do it I don't

162
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:16,669
know that they ever got that implemented

163
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:18,800
but just the notion that this was

164
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:22,909
something that was way back in the

165
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,459
sixties so today we have all all the

166
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:27,919
processing power to make this come

167
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:31,370
together and what we really had is in

168
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,309
the nascent phases of having a useable

169
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:37,459
voice assistant it's not there's still

170
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:41,448
some huge gaps but it's still at least

171
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:42,859
useful to where my kids can have it so

172
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:46,010
anyway three different machine learning

173
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,410
systems voice-to-text the natural

174
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,980
language processing part of it and then

175
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:54,769
the text-to-speech each one has its own

176
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,370
threat model and I only want to talk

177
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,960
about the first two because the meet

178
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,600
different times uh presented this is

179
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,670
that trying to to light cover three

180
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,630
different machine learning models and

181
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:11,530
one top is way too much so just the

182
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:14,140
first two to begin with we have to pick

183
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,220
apart the acoustic landscape if you

184
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,350
think about it we've actually

185
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,590
experienced here in this classroom like

186
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,210
in the sense this talk has started the

187
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:25,030
the fact that there are multiple

188
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:27,550
different sound events and sound like

189
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,410
occurrences in this landscape going on

190
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,880
at the same time we actually two

191
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,430
different hallways with their own

192
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,080
acoustic space that's bleeding in

193
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,079
because the doors are slightly cracked

194
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,280
but then each one of you guys is your

195
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:49,449
own source of sound and we're sitting

196
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:52,150
next to my kids in church you know and

197
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:57,900
then like so there's there's all this

198
00:09:52,150 --> 00:10:01,090
stuff going on in the Honorable space so

199
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:04,150
the first thing we have to do is pick a

200
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:06,940
part that's space that audio space and

201
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,860
zero in on the sound events that we're

202
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,540
interested in and throw the rest of the

203
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,610
way

204
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,310
that sounds very simplistic for me to

205
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:19,470
just say it but to actually do it in

206
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:23,349
processing is really hard for instance

207
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:25,390
they've been doesn't even have like bows

208
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,640
or the headphones that have the - built

209
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:31,630
into them that try to like zero in on

210
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,370
your voice so the way that that works if

211
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,740
it picks apart the space and then tries

212
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,160
to zero in on your voice one of the most

213
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,290
hostile places that you can

214
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,670
the headphones out isn't an airport so

215
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,650
was talking to a colleague of mine once

216
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,089
and when he was talking zeroed in on his

217
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,819
voice when he stopped talking

218
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:50,550
it ranges and finds the announcers voice

219
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:54,330
the person standing next to mostly they

220
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:58,459
announce so point is lots of stuff going

221
00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:01,910
on it's really hard to process so the

222
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:06,030
voice in the whole sound landscape

223
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:08,819
occupies a fairly narrow band a male

224
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:11,449
voice hundred to nine hundred Hertz

225
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,570
female voice like an octave higher so

226
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:18,270
350 to 3 kilohertz the human ear has a

227
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,310
really wide range Oh bit of trivia

228
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:24,319
wallows researchers miss for the male

229
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,319
voice is typically around 100 Hertz

230
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:32,250
James Earl white he had 50 years as his

231
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:35,970
natural voice range the lower your range

232
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,710
of voice that's the radio voice the

233
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:42,360
human ear

234
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:44,820
125 to 12 kilohertz so quiz time who

235
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,330
cares the most about the range of voice

236
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:53,290
frequencies and all that what industry

237
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:57,790
what device manufacturers yes

238
00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:00,219
all centers all senators beakers or

239
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,579
somebody else's hearing aids period

240
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,440
definitely and phones in fact phone

241
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,180
manufacturers cell phone manufacturers

242
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,990
in particular have some of the best

243
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:13,060
white papers on this they try to to

244
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:18,700
really narrow in on voice does anybody

245
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:22,719
know why any guesses safe man exactly

246
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:25,300
yes now you're tempted as someone who's

247
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,380
operating like in this space to cut out

248
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:31,930
everything above 3 kilohertz because the

249
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,970
average female voice can't you know it

250
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,800
goes up to 3 kilohertz maybe you'll snap

251
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,770
it out at 4 kilohertz or something like

252
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,719
that but the nature of sound waves is

253
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:44,710
that it presses up against the higher

254
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:48,340
frequencies so it's if you don't include

255
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:50,530
the higher frequencies then you lose

256
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:54,570
things like consonants and it's harder

257
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:57,250
to understand so we need to capture like

258
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,950
generally the entire range of semen here

259
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,500
it may be a little bit higher - which

260
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:05,080
comes into play a little bit later our

261
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,700
brains are wired though because the

262
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,790
audio landscape is something that we

263
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,120
naturally like process and we've been

264
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:15,099
doing it for forever

265
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,610
we feel that we at least a little tricks

266
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:22,100
but fill in spaces of frequent

267
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,100
a range that we don't actually hear oh

268
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:29,360
and the last part of that is pull it

269
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:32,880
apart sound events is inherently lost

270
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,260
that means that when we're when we have

271
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,260
the acoustic space how many of y'all

272
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,209
have seen a waterfall diagram of sound

273
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,459
or anything like that okay that's it

274
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:44,099
takes the entire spectrum plots and on

275
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:46,079
the graph actually even plotting it on

276
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,360
the graph is losing information by

277
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,849
itself but the point is the more you

278
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,620
hunt for a signal the more that signal

279
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:58,470
trades so going back to the the trick of

280
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,089
the brain this is the Alexa dauber

281
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,490
commercial which was over the first

282
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,570
commercials where Alexa was not actually

283
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,360
triggered because there was like this

284
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:09,240
whole rash of you know Alexa commercials

285
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,899
and news reports triggering Alexa's it

286
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,089
was this funny case of a news story

287
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:18,269
about a kid that was able to buy things

288
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:21,209
on their parents Alexa and the story

289
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:23,790
actually contained Alexa by this and

290
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:25,709
then the news report actually triggered

291
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,849
like all the people listening to it

292
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:31,800
Alexis so there's this like infinitely

293
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:34,170
of Alexis buying things

294
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,589
people reporting about so Apple came up

295
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:39,240
with a solution they would let

296
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:42,180
commercials and news reports know if you

297
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,760
cut out this range in the frequencies

298
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,609
people will still hear the word Alexa

299
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,410
but the device will not pick up on it

300
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:53,430
because the model is not trained for it

301
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:56,339
okay it's an easy way to just bypass the

302
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,229
triggering there's an implicit in

303
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,269
teresting security implication here -

304
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,920
you could be tricked into hearing

305
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:06,029
something the device is not processing

306
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:09,810
because our ears are tuned to filling in

307
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:13,800
this information in other words it would

308
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:16,890
be a way to have a covert channel so the

309
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:20,699
way that you pick apart signals in an

310
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:23,130
audio space is basically a what's called

311
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,560
a fast Fourier transformation so you

312
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,410
take the time domain so the lucky signal

313
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,410
over here and you want to pick apart all

314
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,480
the different signals up here that make

315
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,250
up the signal over here so if you

316
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,770
combine all these signals that come to

317
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:41,910
this if you pick them apart it gives you

318
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,850
this okay that is the heart of audio

319
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,410
process and it's actually the heart of

320
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,180
video process in their image processing

321
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:52,380
or just about any other signal

322
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:55,469
processing okay but especially for audio

323
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,970
processing so we've got the frequency

324
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,700
graph here that most people are used to

325
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:05,760
looking at but what we're looking for is

326
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:08,329
specific audio events yes is that so

327
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,339
microphone is just going to give you

328
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:12,930
changes in voltage when it's best

329
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,550
vibrating and so that's going to give

330
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,920
you that picture on the time that you

331
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:20,589
have shown it at a time domain and then

332
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,780
say that the fast Fourier transform is

333
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:28,870
to pick out the individual frequencies

334
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:31,089
that have to be costly in that yes so to

335
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,820
go back it's good I probably need to go

336
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:35,650
back so a microphone is capturing

337
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,720
samples of the audio space and it's

338
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:40,449
capturing like across the frequency

339
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,490
domain that the microphone is - - not

340
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:45,220
all microphones pick up the same range

341
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,920
but whatever ranges of frequencies it's

342
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,870
tuned to it will pick up a snapshot in

343
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,060
time of what it hears for us those

344
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,860
frequencies and it picks up like that

345
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,989
won't be like it's basically just a

346
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:00,670
frame of data that has this is the

347
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:03,580
intensity of the signal at each one of

348
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:05,970
these frequencies at that time and so a

349
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,400
microphone digital signal processing is

350
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:12,280
something like I guess the average would

351
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,830
be like 16,000 samples per second okay

352
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:18,099
and so what we're doing is we're taking

353
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:20,740
that we're all audio 16,000 samples a

354
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:22,750
second and we're trying to take out of

355
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,240
those like several seconds or probably

356
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:29,590
even milliseconds we want to pick out

357
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,420
what signal we hear in that so that's

358
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,399
another piece of all your processing is

359
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,130
we're taking the audio space we're

360
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:40,690
taking a sample of the sound like every

361
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:42,130
second every usually every 200

362
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,780
milliseconds or so we're taking a

363
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,640
snapshot and then we're running a fast

364
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,399
Fourier transformation on it and then

365
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:53,460
seeing what what signals are in this

366
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,460
space at this time that makes sense

367
00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:00,820
okay if I lost you I have cars message

368
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,899
me later but that is basically the

369
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,210
processing part of just figuring out

370
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:07,370
what signals are in the space at that

371
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,070
time so what we're doing is we're

372
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:12,168
looking for sound events specifically

373
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,840
we're looking for human voice sound

374
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:19,519
event support if we're making a audio

375
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:22,039
assistant however not also Alexa has

376
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,470
this interesting guard mode that you can

377
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:26,419
enable and the reason why you don't have

378
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,149
it enabled all the time is because it is

379
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:34,909
a like some sound events sound very

380
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:36,649
similar like glass breaking or dropping

381
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:41,779
a glass on the floor or something like

382
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:45,080
that so I liked so detecting sound

383
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:48,470
events this is like the very basic car

384
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,570
alarm is won by continual sound glass

385
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:54,759
breaking it's very similar sound or a

386
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:57,710
very definite sound in fact here's a

387
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,419
collection of different sounds and what

388
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,779
their plots look like on what's called

389
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:04,129
the male spectrum a spectrogram is what

390
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:06,289
I was talking about earlier you take the

391
00:19:04,129 --> 00:19:07,549
sample of sound and you run the Fourier

392
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:11,169
transformation over it and you're

393
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:13,789
picking out here's what here's the

394
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:15,980
signals that I'm detecting in the space

395
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:18,200
in this given time so if you zoom in on

396
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,200
this it looks like there's a lot of

397
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,990
ribbons down and that's because there

398
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,440
it's a like a chunked collection of that

399
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,230
sound

400
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,420
face at that time if you look at it you

401
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,670
can either fool yourself into seeing it

402
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:36,830
or just take my word for it or like

403
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:39,080
reason into it that these the graph of

404
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,840
the sound there fits what it's

405
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,060
describing especially the hydraulic

406
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,580
hammer you can see the rhythmic and the

407
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,620
fact that it occupies all frequencies

408
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,340
and then it comes off then it occupies

409
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:55,580
all frequencies that comes off wind

410
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:57,889
milling machine and the sound of

411
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:01,100
generator you can see that the generator

412
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:04,160
is more intense than the milling machine

413
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:07,790
and that the wind noise just generally

414
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,800
flooding all jacks the one that's the

415
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,330
most interesting here are the two that

416
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:17,960
are most interesting of music and

417
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:20,179
talking talking is very unspecified in

418
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,660
other words unless you're singing a note

419
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:26,810
in a song at a constant rate it's not

420
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,820
going to fill the audio spectrum so what

421
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,889
that means is there's only a very short

422
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:34,520
amount of time that your voice is making

423
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:38,090
a an impact on the sound waves in an

424
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,889
acoustical space right so the sampling

425
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:44,209
of that in time and all that matters

426
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:45,380
music even any of you guys use Shazam or

427
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,750
anything to like

428
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,940
determine what song is playing at a

429
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:53,540
certain moment didn't I have a pixel

430
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:55,760
lightning chance a pixel phone okay the

431
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:59,120
pixel phone actually has this built into

432
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,879
it you can download like a chunk of it's

433
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,159
actually 500 Meg's of audio fingerprints

434
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,370
and it's not for every song of the world

435
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:09,470
it's for the top ten thousand songs and

436
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,659
so what these fingerprints are doing is

437
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,940
they're taking the audio space here for

438
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,149
this

439
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,830
and there they're determining if you

440
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,268
have this frequency and then 200

441
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,090
milliseconds later you have this

442
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:23,370
frequency it's a constellation that's

443
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:26,850
that is effectively fingerprinting a

444
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:29,189
song and it takes somehow 350

445
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:32,039
milliseconds of audio data to figure out

446
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:35,059
what song is playing not a whole lot

447
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:37,950
and that comes into play later so

448
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:39,960
another thing before I keep on going is

449
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,750
that the Alexa card doesn't work on

450
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,240
every device it doesn't work on every

451
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,919
device because the MOR triggers you add

452
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,080
to the device the more it has to

453
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,500
actually do classification which is

454
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,769
machine learning operation and the more

455
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:59,340
processing power has to have so the

456
00:21:54,769 --> 00:22:01,409
Amazon echoes can't do this I also have

457
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,720
in there gunshots because one

458
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:06,570
interesting feature or interesting

459
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:11,070
aspect of like audio detection or

460
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:13,439
whatever is - you can triangulate where

461
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:15,860
where something comes from or where it

462
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,649
where sound is coming from

463
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:23,580
so voice the text is all about what's

464
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:26,428
called phonemes phonemes are pieces of

465
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:29,189
speech ok does anybody remember learning

466
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:37,799
how to read phonetically like these two

467
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:40,139
letters make this phonetic sound like or

468
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:44,610
whatever else these are the things that

469
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:46,500
we hear and so phonetics was a style of

470
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,539
teaching that was about taking what we

471
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,690
hear and transcribing it back to the

472
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:55,110
written language okay same thing needs

473
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:57,149
to be done here for voice of text so

474
00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:00,360
what we hear in the audio space are

475
00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:01,399
these these costs are these vowels and

476
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,939
consonants these

477
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,890
these combinations and one interesting

478
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:10,670
thing about this is that phonemes change

479
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:14,470
over time they change by region did

480
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:18,890
anybody have Grand Central Station

481
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:22,430
before it was Google Voice yeah did you

482
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,690
actually it was like the first person

483
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:26,900
I've never run into they had Grand

484
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,640
Central Station basically Google started

485
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,590
this project or no Grand Central Station

486
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,930
started the project and it was like you

487
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,260
could replace your voice mail with this

488
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:39,200
really cool new technology that will

489
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,700
just capture it and story and what they

490
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,580
were doing was they were trying to build

491
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,320
up their voice to text across a broad

492
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:49,490
number of people in different regions

493
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:52,610
and it turns out that you're like how

494
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,590
you say words impacts how machine

495
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:59,080
learning models were made to a really

496
00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:01,189
great degree so Google started there

497
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,320
basically started their Google dot

498
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:06,020
project or their voice assistant project

499
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,790
like over a decade ago because that's

500
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,760
why they bought Grand Central Station is

501
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:12,379
to help build on this time I had a

502
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,450
particularly southern friend of mine

503
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,610
I've always called Lee West voice mails

504
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:20,990
and they would always have some

505
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:22,550
hilarious stuff wrong did anybody have

506
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:27,290
Dragon NaturallySpeaking

507
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:30,320
like yeah you remember how long you had

508
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:32,629
just had to read to it before it before

509
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,110
the model was correct you had to read to

510
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,210
the for like an hour or more before the

511
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:41,149
model would get built and but the thing

512
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:44,180
was it was built to your voice no one

513
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:47,330
else's it was a model train to you the

514
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:50,150
trick with modern voice assistance is

515
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:54,610
that they're trained across a lot of

516
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,610
voices not all but a lot yeah

517
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:19,370
differences to do with how we start out

518
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:22,340
more or less the site places which

519
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:25,459
diverge it was really just about the

520
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:29,689
bowel sighs he meant how the length of

521
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:32,240
the consonants really determine how

522
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:35,120
strong accent was and they may be

523
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,590
different but the problem I see when

524
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:42,408
you're if you were trying to recognize

525
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:50,720
work if your machine is consistently you

526
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:53,269
know long or short entire but within

527
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,460
within that region but in another region

528
00:25:53,269 --> 00:26:02,629
there may be a word this is the same

529
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:04,039
word yes it has the opposite right say

530
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:06,049
well they pronounce it totally different

531
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:08,500
in different regions so does anybody

532
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:14,110
have a guess how that's handled by the

533
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:18,470
model I can see how being handled if you

534
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:20,929
you are bid we write from but it doesn't

535
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,820
know that right then you would have to

536
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:26,810
say a lot of words before it would guess

537
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:29,419
ok there everywhere on earth where I

538
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:31,820
expect this right sound we're

539
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,130
substituting this now therefore that

540
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:37,100
must be one of these regional accents so

541
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:39,320
one of the features of the Grand Central

542
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,409
Station later Google Voice was that when

543
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:45,290
you saw your what it when it spit out

544
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:47,390
for the transcription of your voicemail

545
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,700
you could go back in and edit it and

546
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,550
what that gave them was basically

547
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,650
reinforcement mark so they can and it

548
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:57,200
was free free labor reinforcement

549
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:59,180
learning across thousands and thousands

550
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:04,250
of people and what they also got was

551
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:06,250
regional information right so those two

552
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:09,770
pieces together we're able to say

553
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:12,440
somebody calling me from New York for

554
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:14,930
instance there's a certain set of models

555
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,030
that probably apply to that person and

556
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,530
so what you do is you layer the

557
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:20,780
different models when somebody speaking

558
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:22,700
you layer the different models and say

559
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,980
first you need to do like regional

560
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:30,050
protection right and then you need to do

561
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:32,030
like and there's certain markers like my

562
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,919
Canadian friends in the abudance and

563
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,580
stuff like that like that's dead

564
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,850
giveaway

565
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:41,330
but not all of them have that there's

566
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,870
actually you're right it's a little bit

567
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:44,879
deceptive to say that

568
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,199
voice-to-text as the it's like an entire

569
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,390
machine learning system it's actually a

570
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,480
collection of them one of them is where

571
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,040
you're from and based off of how you say

572
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,620
certain words and then applying the

573
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,690
right model to the voice construct what

574
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,570
I wanted to bring up here with phonemes

575
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:02,460
is models that are trained off of us

576
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,560
speakers and I guess getting down into

577
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,600
it even regional speakers they aren't

578
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,750
transferable there's not a generalized

579
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,090
model to say and now we know Korean or

580
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,400
Chinese or what across has to be a whole

581
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:20,850
different model a whole different set of

582
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:22,650
trainees what that means is well this is

583
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:34,800
the collection part it goes back to the

584
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:36,810
privacy Amazon and Google so this this

585
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,480
case came out late last years and I

586
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:41,639
remember this Amazon like all of a

587
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,280
sudden this guy so what happened was he

588
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,350
asked them I want to know what you're

589
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:50,960
collecting about me can you send me my

590
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:53,100
date now out of this put on our

591
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,690
investigators have here there are

592
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,689
certain things that we can conclude out

593
00:28:54,690 --> 00:29:00,200
of this one it is broadly possible to

594
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,010
tie someone back to their Alexa device

595
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,070
otherwise they wouldn't have been able

596
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:07,920
to give them any of us out of the course

597
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:10,620
second Amazon has no interest in like

598
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,170
separating your audio from everybody

599
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:17,580
else's audio it's basically put into one

600
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:19,230
giant s3 bucket okay and warframes

601
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,259
I'm just guessing in the architecture

602
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:25,369
based off of this event so effectively

603
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:28,769
an engineer and Amazon just like here's

604
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:33,090
basically your audios in this range in

605
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:36,779
this bucket here you go okay this was

606
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:38,249
not a security breach necessary because

607
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,960
it was one guy who was asked a question

608
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:44,070
and he filled out the ticket incorrectly

609
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:46,409
it should not alert alarm us that that

610
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,539
the engineer made a mistake what it

611
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:51,090
should inform us of though is that the

612
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:53,580
data is stored and continually like

613
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:55,918
models are continually run over that

614
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:59,309
data to figure out different properties

615
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,590
so yes it is recording it is storing it

616
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:04,590
I don't know how long the retention of

617
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,840
the storages no idea I wouldn't be

618
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:09,119
surprised if it wasn't very very long

619
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,749
because you need a lot of data to build

620
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:14,070
these models of correctly and also there

621
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:15,389
was a related case I don't have a

622
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,580
picture of this one - in the news

623
00:30:15,389 --> 00:30:20,459
article but Amazon employees recently

624
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,049
like in their internal chat talking

625
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,059
about like different things than they've

626
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:26,730
heard from customers well if they have

627
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:28,529
access to them like the buckets of all

628
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,809
the information then of course they have

629
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:33,809
access to the individual information -

630
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:38,009
and apparently it's enough to where you

631
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:40,739
can actually cure yourself ok related to

632
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:43,529
those two articles throw out another

633
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:46,200
article of there are two active court

634
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:48,600
cases that are pending in the discovery

635
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,850
phase they're there some subpoenaed

636
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,590
Amazon give us the recordings of this

637
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,109
Alexa the reason the belief elite has

638
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:57,629
been triggered and has data about some

639
00:30:55,109 --> 00:31:00,658
crime that happened as far as I know

640
00:30:57,629 --> 00:31:03,389
Amazon still fighting but yes it is that

641
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:05,190
it's recording Amazon employees have

642
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:05,990
access to it to the degree that you

643
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,880
trust him

644
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:13,530
is the grade that you are comfortable

645
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:16,320
with having one of your house car now

646
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:18,780
another thing on this before I go into

647
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,090
the water falling the device is always

648
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,550
listening but it's not always streaming

649
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:27,149
what's happening in the room at that

650
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:30,419
time notice I said the court case they

651
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:32,550
had a reasonable belief that the device

652
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:35,280
had been triggered the device doesn't

653
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:37,110
start recording and like chunking that

654
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:40,710
information until it's been triggered

655
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:43,709
until the wake board has been set going

656
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:45,990
back to the sound events so the the

657
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,180
guard duty that's pushing down a lot

658
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:50,190
more triggers basically to the device if

659
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:53,070
you hear this instance then it's a

660
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:56,220
trigger so those those events become

661
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:59,010
triggers the trigger for almost every

662
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:02,760
device now is the wait word okay Google

663
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:05,790
a Siri Alexa

664
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,710
Oliver those are the triggers the reason

665
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:11,879
is because the device can't be doing

666
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:14,910
that much process it's a small device I

667
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,660
mean the heart of it is not that smart

668
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:21,210
device but when it is triggered then

669
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:23,370
that's when it starts and it doesn't

670
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,620
capture the entire audio space there's

671
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:29,129
actually some really cool research

672
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:31,139
articles from of the Alexa T the Alexa

673
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:33,270
side of Alexis Sciences they had a

674
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,730
division of assignment and one of them

675
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:38,820
is anchoring the weight word to the

676
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:40,659
person that's speaking you may have

677
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:46,269
analytics in their house I usually ask

678
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:48,799
anybody I'd watch and I give this this

679
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:50,659
also because I love the promise of

680
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,539
audience period but it basically in our

681
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:56,840
house when we when we go to play music

682
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:59,360
when my kids will say they'll trigger

683
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,158
the device Alexa and they're still

684
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,250
thinking about what they want it to do

685
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:07,130
or like play and another cannabis would

686
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:10,880
bring it play this play another song

687
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,110
okay the point is we'll get to it a

688
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,340
little bit more in a second but the

689
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:19,039
device doesn't know who's speaking it

690
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,649
has no concept and flesh that out a

691
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,120
little bit more in a second but now all

692
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:25,639
it's listening for is the wait for it

693
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,469
and then it sends the rest of it or it

694
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:29,510
tries to pick out pick out who speaker

695
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,539
is they can't take that

696
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:34,250
send the fast Fourier transformation

697
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:36,590
detect which is actually a very small

698
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:39,620
amount data but it's still enough data

699
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:44,090
that you can reconstruct voice up dammuz

700
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:47,678
on systems so how can we protect the

701
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:50,928
device from listening to us all the time

702
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,059
so I propose that we should think about

703
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:54,950
so there's the network concept of a

704
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:57,559
firewall that protects the ports from

705
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,649
coming in I propose for audio security

706
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:03,049
we have a concept of a waterfall

707
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:05,739
waterfalls flood out sound behind us an

708
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:08,899
extra make your device work better to

709
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:12,949
noise helps us isolate sounds if you

710
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:15,339
have a headset noise-canceling headset I

711
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:17,629
did this recently installed an AC unit

712
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:19,790
right behind me and so it's like

713
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:21,109
flooding the space behind me and after

714
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,639
listening to all of this and all the

715
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:23,159
research I was like I bet it's gonna

716
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,260
make your

717
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,330
better two little conference calls she

718
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,910
was right because it floods out all the

719
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:34,739
noises past that like the street kids

720
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:38,310
and everything else another note here

721
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:42,060
silence and noise as far as a digital

722
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:43,920
processing is roughly the same what we

723
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:47,460
experienced the silence is really

724
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,889
lowered intensity of the audio space so

725
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:53,340
all those combined we can do something

726
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:55,350
like put a parasite onto a digital

727
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,680
assistant device and what that looks

728
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,430
like

729
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,279
is this funny we'll have here 3d printed

730
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:04,370
when it's got inside of it is a

731
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,890
Raspberry Pi a this is part of the

732
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:10,620
project alias if you guys are interested

733
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,940
in that it's all the plans for the

734
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:15,870
software everything's over the source

735
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:18,480
what it does is we teach it your own

736
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:20,759
weight word so you can rename your

737
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,980
device and it's listening for your

738
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,950
weight work while flooding the device

739
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,450
under of the sound and then once you

740
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:29,040
trigger it with your weight word it

741
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,109
stops flooding the device under the

742
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,050
sound plays the lake word for device and

743
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:37,140
then you can interact with it as normal

744
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:39,210
most people are going to spend the time

745
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,950
or whatever to build this so I'm not

746
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,440
advocating this is like a generalized

747
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:45,419
solution mostly it was a fun hobby and

748
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,540
an excuse that I gave my wife to spend a

749
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:53,430
lot of time so but I bring it up because

750
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:55,050
flooding out devices with audio and

751
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,279
sound like you remember the old spy

752
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:59,220
movies I'm sitting in the bathtub

753
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:02,430
running the watery stuff there's still

754
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:04,950
some usefulness to that mentality so if

755
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:07,230
you're around the device think about am

756
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:09,629
I the only one speaking or am i a part

757
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,370
of a crowd is how easy or hard would it

758
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:16,950
be for that device over there to pick up

759
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:18,089
my voice and stuff like that so this

760
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,520
brings me back to the speaker

761
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,190
identification the most that a device

762
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,970
can do is detect that there are multiple

763
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:27,270
people speak

764
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:29,970
in an in a space what it can also do is

765
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,620
perform like very simple calculations on

766
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,080
the frequency range of your of the

767
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,210
voices that are speaking to say is this

768
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,450
voice high and squeaky like my kids

769
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:42,960
friends probably a child okay or is it

770
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:46,080
is it higher or is it lower than 350

771
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,290
Hertz probably a man's voice otherwise

772
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:51,330
if it's higher than like 900 Hertz maybe

773
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,279
a woman's voice somewhere around there

774
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:56,670
these are probabilistic calculations

775
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,020
right the amount of human data the

776
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,730
reason I spent so much time on the

777
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:03,450
frequency ranges the amount of data

778
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:05,250
that's in a voice is not enough to give

779
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:08,100
you like confidence cryptographic

780
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:10,230
certainly not anywhere close between

781
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,540
this person's voice and another person's

782
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,940
voice even if you trained a model using

783
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,370
dragon even that sort of a model there's

784
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,170
training your voice it's not enough for

785
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:22,640
somebody that further for the model to

786
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:26,790
say this is absolutely this person

787
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:30,589
basically the collision the the degree

788
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:34,980
of collisions there is very problem so

789
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:36,330
while researching this I as if I

790
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,850
remembered that there so this is from

791
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:42,420
the movie sneakers very big movie person

792
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,770
in case but movie sneakers has a scene

793
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,210
in it where they're trying to get access

794
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,370
to somebody's accountant so they're

795
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:50,780
trying to find like recordings of this

796
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:54,150
person's voice saying hi my name is blah

797
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:56,430
my voice is my passport verified okay

798
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,590
and then the whole like scenes the movie

799
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:01,080
or them capturing clips and phrases of

800
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,910
the person is saying pieces of them the

801
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,279
funny thing here is that the technology

802
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:07,890
to clone a person's voice already

803
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,870
existed when that movie was made so it

804
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:13,350
was completely superfluous nobody would

805
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:16,109
have done it but after researching this

806
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:19,440
I decided who in their right minds would

807
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:22,590
implement unlocking something with your

808
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,370
voice well it turns out a bank would do

809
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:29,070
that and specifically my back

810
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,600
and so this is their like thing about

811
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,430
you can access your account on your

812
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,259
phone you just speak to it and hey my

813
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:36,930
voice is my passport because we remember

814
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:41,100
we remember the movie but we don't

815
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:43,470
remember the lesson from the movie in

816
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:46,140
that same page is my voice ID secure

817
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:48,240
sure we have a proprietary algorithm but

818
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,100
you can't bend the laws of physics to

819
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,390
make the voice have more bits of

820
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,950
information in it to make a

821
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,230
cryptographically security

822
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:57,270
this is a dumb idea but lest you think

823
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:59,460
that my bangs the only one that did this

824
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:03,330
there's multiple banks that business

825
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:06,240
multiple banks including HSBC the fun

826
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:08,160
thing about HSBC is somebody decided

827
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,770
this is a bad idea they went and they

828
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,109
proved like here's how we can do it not

829
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:16,650
only did they do this but they did it on

830
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:18,570
live BBC Leighton they brought in the

831
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,550
twin I love this picture because it kind

832
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,980
of captures the whole light this was a

833
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:25,410
dumb idea to protect my bank my bank

834
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,000
account with my voice I'm not going to

835
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:29,700
go into all the other things but I will

836
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,960
layout view anytime you see voice being

837
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:36,720
used as a access control run it can't be

838
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,670
it's like I'm not gonna I don't want to

839
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:45,959
be too strong in this denunciation but

840
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:47,940
no pin drop is a great local company

841
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,590
they're researching the space of how to

842
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,530
do it but it's also in conjunction with

843
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:54,870
other factors it's the second thing I

844
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:57,180
love pin drop but even they won't claim

845
00:39:54,870 --> 00:40:02,279
like we can totally secure a count by

846
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:05,430
one factor force yeah catch me

847
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,930
afterwards how do we do it like when I'm

848
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:09,350
listening to you like I've heard you

849
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:13,319
speak before like I know your voice even

850
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:14,700
without seeing you pick up cues yes I

851
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,620
mean I wouldn't assert that that's

852
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,049
graphic certainty but like you know when

853
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,810
I hear

854
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,760
voice of recognized label yes I know it

855
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:24,279
yeah we know the characteristics of the

856
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,260
voice what I'm saying is like it's you

857
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,390
broadly you know that it's me and not my

858
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:31,090
wife and not some other completely other

859
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:33,850
people that you met you have a kind of

860
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:35,500
fuzzy matchstick but my point is

861
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,779
something else can come along and

862
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,580
duplicate that voice like it's not

863
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,710
there's a whole nother section of this

864
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,270
talk about duplicating voices that's

865
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,290
what the cryptographic certain stuff

866
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,240
comes in okay

867
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,910
like you know that you think you know

868
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,879
that it's me but the other part of the

869
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:55,120
talk cloning voices we don't really know

870
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:58,660
right and so moving on there's a lot to

871
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:01,509
go into here and really what I found

872
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,730
that also recently as a pixel allows for

873
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,590
you to voice unlock your phone another

874
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:15,460
bad security design but at least Google

875
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:16,990
decides never mind

876
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,340
so they have this feature like you could

877
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:21,029
I'm not gonna follow that place when you

878
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,030
go to turn it on

879
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:30,100
they at least tell you this makes your

880
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:30,580
device a lot less secure and yes last

881
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,319
month

882
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,779
they completely remove the feature

883
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,370
because it's completely insecure it's

884
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,200
funny because like these large companies

885
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:40,870
are putting out poise security and then

886
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,910
walking it back alright

887
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:44,710
NLP I don't know if I'm able to do this

888
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:47,598
in three months but we'll try this is

889
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:51,480
how you're Alexa uses in a feed

890
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:54,990
other stuff your weight word your launch

891
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:58,859
which is an application invocation wait

892
00:41:54,990 --> 00:42:01,379
word action application and variables

893
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:03,930
that's how it works so what you're doing

894
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:07,890
is you're telling this and then the NLP

895
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:11,220
in your device Alexa cheese it fills in

896
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:14,250
this other information so if you say

897
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:16,618
Alexa play law it cheats and says so

898
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:20,720
what you want is this music application

899
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:23,010
whatever else so to quickly go over that

900
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,839
companies tightly control the taxonomy

901
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,400
and to craft a better user experience

902
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:28,200
they have these cheats in it basically

903
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,380
you don't know what happier talking to

904
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,450
this is a real security model you don't

905
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,280
know what app you've triggered when you

906
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,680
tip when you ask Alexa to tell you a

907
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,049
joke you don't know which app is

908
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,180
actually providing the joke which

909
00:42:40,049 --> 00:42:43,859
matters when you want to Joe this from

910
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,890
the broad pool of jokes you don't want a

911
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:48,150
continual stream of Jimmy Fallon jokes

912
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:51,328
which is what Alexis started doing a

913
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:54,750
while back no way to tell there's no

914
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:57,299
there's also no sense of context no sono

915
00:42:54,750 --> 00:43:00,230
session does anybody can anybody guess

916
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:04,770
what the security application is of that

917
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:07,380
no session information your device has

918
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:09,599
authorized once for your account and

919
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,450
anybody was able to speak to that device

920
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,690
has that authorization level there's no

921
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:19,558
elevating lowering authorization reading

922
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:22,530
this stuff so some of alexinnz features

923
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:26,250
have allowed you to like tie it to

924
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:27,510
broadly if if the adult is speaking

925
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,809
whatever what they're trying to do is

926
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:34,480
filter out children okay but it's not

927
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:36,789
it's not super secure

928
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,700
so there was part of the NLP part is the

929
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:42,220
family had their conversation recorded

930
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,288
and sent to a contact that was not a

931
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:46,930
security issue baked into the elects

932
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:49,029
what happened was the NLP picked up on

933
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:50,799
the weight word then they then it

934
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:52,539
matched something that sounded my call

935
00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:54,970
and then it matched something that

936
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:58,240
sounded like a contact and then the rest

937
00:43:54,970 --> 00:44:01,029
of it was just an open channel okay but

938
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,709
it was that the model was very very like

939
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:05,170
a truck it was trying to be super

940
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:07,869
helpful and pick up all these key words

941
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:11,019
from a very far distance called a far

942
00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:12,490
field problem and so novel so we were

943
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:14,740
talking about like regional dialects

944
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:16,990
whatever that's one issue

945
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:19,180
another issue is how that sounds across

946
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:25,269
the span of a room up to like 30 feet

947
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:27,879
away so Google's Amazon's response to

948
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:30,459
this was to limit the field that it

949
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,200
would listen to so the effect of that is

950
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,809
now I have to yell at the Alexa in my

951
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,609
talk with me rather than being able to

952
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:42,339
just talk to it and it deals with all

953
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:44,650
the deep data so to sum up and there's

954
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:47,589
there's ties to say about all of these

955
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:49,269
pieces our is really not enough to do it

956
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:51,390
justice so if you want to catch me later

957
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:53,709
feel free I've got business cards

958
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:56,740
everything else going it's we whatever

959
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:58,809
later three areas I want you to consider

960
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:03,339
voice identity and authorization is not

961
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:06,309
something that audio systems do or I

962
00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:08,790
would argue can do by the physics of how

963
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:11,970
much voice or how much data can

964
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:13,980
invoice the apps that are on the Alexa

965
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:16,230
camp part they don't have a way to

966
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:19,020
identify themselves to you so you don't

967
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:20,730
know what happended to you it's highly

968
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:23,280
it's very easy there's research papers

969
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:26,700
on injecting malicious apps into the

970
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,930
skill store although Amazon is very they

971
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,330
they say they're very diligent about

972
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,830
police and have conveying sensitive

973
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:35,790
information we never even got in that

974
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:39,180
part but it's across a medium that we

975
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:41,340
are designed to like here and process

976
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,830
and then the last one privilege

977
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:46,830
separation when it comes to basically up

978
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:51,560
one session token' for the device and it

979
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:54,060
is a forever session time so with that

980
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,279
thank you guys for coming been asking

981
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,600
questions all along but is there any

982
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,140
other questions that we didn't get to

983
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,220
real quick I don't want to be too unkind

984
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,940
to the next speaker

985
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:07,859
yes okay so for authentication I've seen

986
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,060
another company and do this where they

987
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,620
would they would give you the string of

988
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,930
numbers and say repeat these numbers

989
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:15,630
instead of saying like a phrase that you

990
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:18,120
can kind of piece out record its data

991
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:21,740
better security solution or say gonna

992
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:26,910
read this phrase with that help you know

993
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:29,879
basically any any audio that you use if

994
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:33,180
this is a single source of audio then it

995
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,920
could be spooked it can be played but

996
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,990
they have a program that would say okay

997
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,200
I'm gonna it would have to have all at

998
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:41,819
mine you mean like a capture of a voice

999
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,529
yeah you could replay it because it's

1000
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:45,720
random right they're gonna say repeat

1001
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:47,430
these random numbers yeah and if you

1002
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,220
don't you you'd have to piece it in

1003
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:51,310
together and then play it right not

1004
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,899
really because

1005
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:56,380
second half of this talk was all about

1006
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:58,420
voice money and so nutshell there as I

1007
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,670
conclude your voice in like ten minutes

1008
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,260
or so of sample data and then I could

1009
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:04,390
play whatever I wanted

1010
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:05,680
oh so you can just you can make it up

1011
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:07,509
right okay

1012
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:19,180
