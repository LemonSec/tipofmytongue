support working for arrives for various

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,090
security vendors lieutenant Colonel's

00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:33,400
for the last 15 years the IBM partners

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,050
other lab saviors focus on helping

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,899
security companies of all sizes

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,459
Xavier is the first part of startup

11
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,260
drawbridge networks are irresistible

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,450
bringing the first micro segmentation

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,260
solution for servers and workstations

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,090
apart

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:01:04,539
mr. Ashe holds many industry

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:01:07,420
certifications including Spanish I I so

17
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:09,400
yeah end of the day and there's a lot of

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,260
very technical talks probably learn to

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,570
hold us and I'm just going to get up

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,770
here and complain for the next 25

21
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,899
minutes hopefully getting a little bit

22
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:20,199
energy to keep you awake so we get to

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,509
the market on free stuff right so today

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,700
I wanted to kind of go off on about

25
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:26,470
indicators are compromised love you guys

26
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,240
have probably been introduced to this

27
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,670
concept before and so we're going to go

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,729
a couple aspects of it and I hope people

29
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,290
take away some if not yeah you're just

30
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:39,050
here for the free stuff after I'm done

31
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,510
talking a little bit about me I'm old

32
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:44,330
I've been around started hacking black

33
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:48,680
babies anybody here at the center

34
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,729
meetings late 80s early 90s they were

35
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,060
still doing it

36
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:56,810
same place of the Linux mom food court

37
00:01:53,060 --> 00:02:02,330
we were dragging in paid funding to be

38
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:03,619
ripped off and also just pretty

39
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,080
interesting I love it is still going on

40
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:08,179
so like I said I've been working from a

41
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,699
bunch of companies I did consulting for

42
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:13,430
a lot of my career so I have lots of

43
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,988
little really interesting experiences a

44
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,910
couple of years back inside

45
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,290
you know I was done telling people how

46
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,540
to do security and I went back into

47
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,859
doing security started doing taking

48
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:27,859
corporate roles and so so back into that

49
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:31,760
role leading the group of really great

50
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:36,320
engineers and I'm gonna paint that soon

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,440
will be the six largest denominations

52
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:45,380
pretty excited about that and so there's

53
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:48,049
my contacts all right so what is entire

54
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,070
city that started off LLO so we make

55
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:51,260
sure that we're all talking about the

56
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:57,730
same thing so they are things that

57
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:57,730
indicate compromise right

58
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,549
[Applause]

59
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,319
so Google whose fault is this

60
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,739
why are we going so what's interesting

61
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:18,980
about I did some research on this

62
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:23,280
Richard number of books he was a

63
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:25,798
historian by my education and so he did

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,140
a story look to see Gwynn did we

65
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,760
actually start using the term educators

66
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,160
compromise now you found a bunch of

67
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,620
books that decide that yeah we said the

68
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,799
term indicators programming around mid

69
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,660
90s or so indicators of compromising was

70
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,310
used but they actually use of the term

71
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,959
as like a thing was the right round

72
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,660
about the same time both firm mandiant

73
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:53,129
their first mandate nem trans report

74
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:55,980
published on January 25th 2010 and then

75
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:59,609
about the house is the next day I'm 36

76
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,858
mat Fraser publishes the combat the ABT

77
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,590
by sharing indicators are compromised at

78
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:07,459
the manual forever changing our world

79
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:10,560
and making an ally or seasoned thing now

80
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:13,560
once you take a good note about how what

81
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,760
is an indicator that's probably not what

82
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,798
you guys think of is the one an

83
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,988
indicator is that's a lot more advanced

84
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,460
my indicators we've lost a little bit of

85
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:26,250
education one way so in 2010 that's what

86
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,500
a indicator was and so now because of

87
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,039
their lovely apt reports we all must

88
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,479
collect all the IRCs

89
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,010
alright so I RC Bonanza would let's

90
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,380
think about all the different things IR

91
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,240
seems to be most of us are used to

92
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,030
thinking by overseas and

93
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,349
he addresses hashes URL filenames but

94
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,138
there's a couple other interesting ones

95
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:47,430
who can get into some of these and dive

96
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,349
into how crappy

97
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,930
each of them are but we've got our

98
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:53,430
register keys and values email subject

99
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,210
lines I love that one because you know

100
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,009
that one's very consistent but some good

101
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:07,830
when there's is the TLS certificate

102
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:10,650
numbers and and we've got source names

103
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,740
point interesting buy used Bitcoin

104
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,539
addresses any other reports brick MAC

105
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,340
addresses freedom to your location so a

106
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:19,979
lot of different things that can be

107
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,638
misused a lot of a lot of opportunity

108
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,199
for misuse

109
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,819
now what the geolocation thing we

110
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:28,259
actually use a lot of geolocation stuff

111
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:33,090
but any geography nerds out there

112
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:34,590
alright so the center of the nation all

113
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,739
right is in northern Kansas near the

114
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:43,619
Nebraska border if center spot is 29

115
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:46,639
degrees 1550 North 98 degrees 35 west

116
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,320
which comes up to in the digital map is

117
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,020
thirty nine point eight three three two

118
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,310
three and negative 98 five point eight

119
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,039
five five two two

120
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,169
so back in 2002 when that little company

121
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,789
called maps mind everybody news backs

122
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,409
plans now I was first using their

123
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:03,449
digital point to say what is the center

124
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:05,969
of the day they said close enough we're

125
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:09,240
going to use negative thirty or thirty

126
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:11,430
eight thirty eight point zero and

127
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,219
negative ninety southern winter as the

128
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,139
third default location well this default

129
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:18,000
location ended up in the front yard of

130
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,990
this poor groups are for poor families

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,569
of Kansas home this was James and Teresa

132
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,130
Arnold the the plaintiffs were

133
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:28,050
repeatedly awakened from their sleep

134
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,639
disturbed from their daily activities by

135
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,980
local state and federal officials would

136
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,470
be

137
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,710
a retrial missing person evidence of

138
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:38,950
computer fraud or call for an attempted

139
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:41,229
suicide this is from a complaint that

140
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,909
they filed actually sued max line I

141
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,070
thought it was a very interesting story

142
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:48,610
how much we dedicated ourselves on come

143
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:51,520
to our deal location information so if

144
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,270
you have an apt coming from central

145
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,979
Kansas

146
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,810
you probably look at today and again

147
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,100
that's that's the default location but

148
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,620
there's lots of interesting stories

149
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:03,130
about how we've got the geo locations

150
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,540
wrong we have interesting where geo

151
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,480
locations are different from different

152
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:14,710
systems and systems in North Korea

153
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:17,650
this one says Canada all right so how

154
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,989
can I give me some of these IRCs right

155
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,239
first you steal from the internet right

156
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,010
so they're just lots of threee IFC's out

157
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,410
there you generally get what you pay for

158
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,830
but there's a really good place to start

159
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:32,470
there's some good places to start

160
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,729
looking for all of these Direct Connect

161
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,360
I'll talk a little bit about that in a

162
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,800
future

163
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,560
we've got Breck Netcom slash free place

164
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,390
now you have to create a press connect

165
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,270
account to get to those there's couple

166
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:49,300
of things on github that I found but

167
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,799
lots of good places to get lots of bio

168
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,710
C's because that's what you need right

169
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,030
is there's lots and lots of IRC and

170
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,830
especially when you're Boston

171
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,570
to get some of these IRC why aren't you

172
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,760
checking the IOC's we need some IR sees

173
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,800
you can get some free ones alright so

174
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,810
then next that you can pay for this is

175
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,990
the lovely one so this is the company

176
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:15,170
that says we are going to sell security

177
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:18,560
threat intelligence intelligence I wish

178
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,960
to work for IBM I was a part of doubling

179
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,420
and I was part of the security group and

180
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,020
then we've got the cube radar radar was

181
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:29,720
not so it was threatened intelligence so

182
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,010
then I said well well not that that

183
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,210
threat intelligence there's all these

184
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,350
other companies selling threat

185
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,460
intelligence and there's threat

186
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,550
intelligence companies are actually

187
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,840
selling IFC's with some reports and so

188
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,849
it's very confusing for the marketing

189
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:45,140
folks over at IBM to say no we really

190
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:47,060
meant some neuroses but there are some I

191
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,380
think the most enterprises you you're

192
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:53,660
poor you're going to have some level of

193
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,689
this paid for and they do provide IP

194
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,339
fees they also provided reports and a

195
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,560
lot of contexts around them and so

196
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,830
please don't take these fairly expensive

197
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,530
services and say yeah I'm just pulling

198
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,030
all the idea dresses off of our recorded

199
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:11,120
futures feed or not only or whatever you

200
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,560
go so be sure I understand the context

201
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,880
and understand how to put this day

202
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,550
together as we go forward

203
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:20,060
I guess lucky you already pay for so

204
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:23,680
this is where I had a thing called Cisco

205
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:27,560
tells you might know what Cisco tells us

206
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,870
good data good threat intelligence

207
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,060
company does lots of good stuff do you

208
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,810
know how you get threatened Cisco don't

209
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:39,859
tell us threat these can you go buy them

210
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:41,869
anybody no no you get them when you buy

211
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:46,529
Cisco equipment right so if you buy

212
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:49,379
Cisco there WUSA the

213
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:52,350
is there security equipment you get all

214
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:54,360
that valuable stuff and so so some of

215
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,889
these you might actually be able to get

216
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,149
you know threat intelligence or IR

217
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:59,850
seized from some of the existing

218
00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:03,180
equipment you have some of the other

219
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:05,370
ones that don't kind of restrict but

220
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,888
allow you to get an additional if you

221
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,100
actually have a product exports exchange

222
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:14,399
for my BM crop strike dress records it's

223
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,620
now on but either way if you think that

224
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,160
you you go and you asked do we have any

225
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,779
threat intelligence companies in your

226
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,059
sourcing team says now we never we don't

227
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,230
pay for that go look at the screening

228
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:26,819
tools you have their problem they're

229
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,059
going to have their own level of threat

230
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:31,680
deliveries now the most valuable one

231
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:33,870
that up there says is the ones that you

232
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,540
make up yourself so I wanted to get a

233
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,370
good idea of who we got in here so how

234
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,509
many people are blue teamers they're

235
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:46,079
going to use io C's to catch bad guys

236
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:48,329
alright so how many overs are incident

237
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,109
responders forensics folks that break

238
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:51,109
and break things apart

239
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,229
so when you make them up when I was

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,689
eight years that you need to generate

241
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:12,000
your own magazine and and this is from

242
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:15,029
all of your your your current

243
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,639
technologies that protect you that you

244
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:18,600
know all that noise from the front end

245
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,759
IDS's and firewalls

246
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,189
all of those virus detection alerts that

247
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,779
you you know you probably ignore those

248
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:26,759
are indicators are compromised and

249
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:28,290
they're very valuable because those are

250
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,970
the ones that are threatening you so we

251
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,829
get to later on how to prioritize these

252
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,529
but if you're already being attacked by

253
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:37,859
them that's pretty much by Ortiz so

254
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:41,579
again if you're not currently have an

255
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,470
IRC program where you are taking in the

256
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:46,329
other season your song is generating

257
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,780
faces this needs to be a priority for

258
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:51,580
you sorry curating collecting started

259
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,319
about a couple of these in my mentor has

260
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,990
been too much time on on each of these

261
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,090
myths of great places to start the

262
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,730
collection and curation talk about how

263
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:03,460
you deal with all of your IRA sees I

264
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:06,070
miss anybody any unused missus malware

265
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,320
information sharing purple your platform

266
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,060
yeah this was good opening source told

267
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,190
another good - correct

268
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,290
I was just being told earlier this

269
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,430
morning about how awesome crit is and

270
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:20,020
there's so much better than mess with

271
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:21,550
you so totally use press a couple of

272
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,400
others that they're not there that I've

273
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:26,469
used them I want ways like alien alien

274
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,199
law as always got some good stuff out

275
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,730
there got a pretty good community I

276
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,860
don't know what happens with some time I

277
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,750
guess last year 18 T bottom so just

278
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,640
definitely not compare an effort in

279
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,490
their ATT company oh that makes it

280
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,830
better or not but more information right

281
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,700
connect just is I would point to these

282
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:48,100
guys because some point at Def Con when

283
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,690
I was good that perfect inebriation

284
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,630
where I'm coming up with a really good

285
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:54,370
ideas I completely thought if recommend

286
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,900
like I'm like eight years ago

287
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,450
oh we're going to keep this thing in the

288
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:01,240
cloud realize I put together your make

289
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,670
it awesome and then like when trekking

290
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,240
there came out like hey I already

291
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,180
thought of that

292
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,930
I'm actually but yeah reconnect this is

293
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:13,239
a pretty good service offers a service

294
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,699
for we're doing this type of collection

295
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,540
of curating of

296
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,370
information also I was another and then

297
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,410
now I throw out these these other terms

298
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,900
here in case you confronted you

299
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,900
so overnight see says is so open that

300
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,150
mandiant knows uses it a couple of

301
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,370
others there now are still do but and

302
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:37,800
generally has been moved more to more

303
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:39,270
common formats taxi and sticks everybody

304
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,680
were wrestling around with some of these

305
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,130
open source tools trying to get those

306
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,439
six speeds but this is basically the

307
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:49,439
kind of common language between sharing

308
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:53,430
these these IOC s and types of bone

309
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,900
building information I think it's Mike

310
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,479
or make I always forget to have

311
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:00,810
pronounced that the malware had

312
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,820
treatable attributable enumeration and

313
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,949
characterization Aragon this probably

314
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,750
not many people use it so if somebody

315
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,000
asked me throw that in because that was

316
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,320
so much better than sticks which since

317
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,570
I've wrestle with sticks so many times I

318
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,300
can I can definitely the test of that

319
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,280
and then sigh box which now is part of

320
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,500
sticks but throwing up therefore also

321
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:23,970
verbs that used to use it back in the

322
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:26,370
deck all right so we start generating

323
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,110
our own IFC's or we're collecting them

324
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:34,830
over stealing them whatever we're doing

325
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:36,600
with them and so let's talk about I have

326
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,450
suplex cycle obviously what I saw was

327
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,370
that these IOC s do not live forever we

328
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:45,210
need to throw them out we need to be

329
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:47,580
able to say sorry that domain is it's no

330
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,320
good anymore that IP address is no good

331
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,030
anymore so when you create this program

332
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,890
make sure that you're not just feeding

333
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,420
and databases just using bigger and

334
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,819
bigger and bigger but you have put

335
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,280
life's that we've put a life time on

336
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,880
each of your C's make sure this is part

337
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,790
of your program alright so how how to do

338
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:10,640
threatening with IRC so still one is

339
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:13,920
done like Brett this is not hunting okay

340
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,010
so this one pull-up described from also

341
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,829
good

342
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,480
Richard here from his prep the practice

343
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,580
of network security Viborg

344
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,300
from our lovely guy lovely guys over

345
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,770
there start to press 2013 so I have

346
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,839
probably have a lot over the years and

347
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:34,569
I've got a lot sim work as a consultant

348
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:36,790
and but I want this to be coming up and

349
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:41,290
I said a burger I ever see centric

350
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:45,250
analysis or magic versus IO C 3 analysis

351
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:48,339
are hunting this was 2013 very early on

352
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:51,790
in this whole life of the IRCs but

353
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:53,290
really says that this is a you're doing

354
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,990
either seek magic do not call yourself a

355
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:58,689
threat hunter now the red hunting can't

356
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,700
start with irises I'm not going to get

357
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,530
into how to do hunting that's a rant but

358
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,360
this is just make sure that you're

359
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:07,260
completely articulate about what you're

360
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:12,100
doing and it is not just using IRC

361
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:13,360
alright so if you're gonna do this

362
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,940
matching mm-hmm

363
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,160
do you have the data to begin with now

364
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,630
there you know we the previous slide all

365
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,800
this great stuff you know maybe you're

366
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,880
paying for and like I like the time you

367
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,380
Texas and other things that you can

368
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,810
normally get if you're really doing

369
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,340
forensic analysis but if you were a blue

370
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,930
team and that's why I put sock up here

371
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,570
if you're part of the blue team that has

372
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:36,760
to defend and do this kind of IOC

373
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:39,210
matching on ongoing basis then you

374
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,310
probably have things like IPAs URLs

375
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:45,010
domains this is all coming in as from DS

376
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,089
of your existing mobile platforms but do

377
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,490
you have something out there that's

378
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,490
actually can stand and produced registry

379
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:53,620
key and values there's a couple of tools

380
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:57,460
out there you know that can do you know

381
00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:03,010
on demand question answer they can do

382
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:04,160
some scanning think of your tools and

383
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:06,470
say okay for you're going to

384
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,240
get these as IFC's make sure that you

385
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,900
can have match them up on a real-time

386
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,579
basis if that if that is reused oops now

387
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,260
if you don't want to then it's been

388
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,240
you're pushing this off too

389
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,920
you're a forensics team that once they

390
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,079
give the invent or they get whatever

391
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,820
that they can then do the matching but

392
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,109
don't expect to be able to do that

393
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:27,829
registry come at you if you're not

394
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:29,689
producing then on basis TLS search does

395
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:32,270
another one I really think that this is

396
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,680
a very important baby not only because I

397
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,600
work for midnight for a while and we

398
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,420
made a big deal about this but there's a

399
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,949
lot of these cases of being able to know

400
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,700
those digital signatures are really

401
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,630
useful that helps us to be able to

402
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,490
definitely determine you don't have to

403
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,620
necessarily do hash lookups to be able

404
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,360
to determine go to bed when you're doing

405
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,250
a big analysis you know the forensics

406
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,449
team stuff they they basically do be

407
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,580
quite less going to make sure they get

408
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,710
away off and all them good other way and

409
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:01,250
you can easily do this with with search

410
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:03,770
serials but that that finding those

411
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,290
stolen certain serials in your

412
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:09,470
environment is really a high fidelity

413
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:11,180
indicator but if you're not looking for

414
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,590
them you know it's only the princi skies

415
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,170
are going to get it in this way after

416
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,939
you've already been out so look at your

417
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,260
your tools to figure out how you can

418
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,490
start pulling those in others letting

419
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:24,050
ETR cold that's sometimes is if you're

420
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,920
going configured if you actually turned

421
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:31,129
it on so so make sure that it's portable

422
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:34,460
point addresses so anybody in here that

423
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:36,260
actually has a security tool that

424
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:40,580
automatically pulls those out for you

425
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:42,830
anybody yeah all right one all right so

426
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,889
this is something I've configured in and

427
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:49,159
bro I've configured in other proxies you

428
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:52,400
know looking for coin traffic not just

429
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,840
because I'm afraid of miners landing in

430
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,940
my system which that's that's what I

431
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,970
tell my boss is that's the big you know

432
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:01,220
scared but there are people doing

433
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,690
Bitcoin transactions and it would be

434
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,440
interesting to see be able to see that

435
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,780
if you can capture that be some of your

436
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,410
network analysis or score or web browser

437
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:13,110
in houses very again high fidelity IRC

438
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,510
is there all right MAC address is one of

439
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,580
those good ones you know is uh because

440
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:21,480
nobody really cares about MAC addresses

441
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:27,780
until this last wave of supply chain

442
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:30,720
attacks with a surge right did you get

443
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:33,629
the list of MAC addresses let me go and

444
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,260
check here I think I have them I'm a six

445
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,260
month ago

446
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,450
Bob houses uh put in is rare because

447
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,949
unless so so there are certain types of

448
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,530
software I used to work for one that

449
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,570
that did a complete state table of your

450
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,450
environment knew exactly where every

451
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:57,570
executable file was create a big old

452
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:00,510
database it's really hard to run but it

453
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:03,899
really was very useful in knowing

454
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:05,820
exactly what every single hash is now to

455
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,010
do that once you install an agent it's

456
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,389
got to scan the entire drive it's got

457
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,129
sitting that data back to it remember

458
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,290
database you gotta keep up with all

459
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,960
that's a heavy lift for a lot company

460
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:19,670
along somewhere and and so a lot of Idi

461
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,950
our products they really don't get that

462
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,450
hash until it executes sort it's written

463
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,820
there's some some other type of trigger

464
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,190
so I'll have to do a full scan so when

465
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,840
you think that you have a database of

466
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,700
your of your file hashes in your

467
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,230
environment we really think about it how

468
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,100
did I get those financials

469
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:41,600
when is that house executed and so that

470
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,600
I can know that I have a complete answer

471
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:49,640
alright so if so this is was here and

472
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:52,500
saw right the I was able to find a

473
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,510
graphical for all the forensics guys

474
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,960
that are using this because it's a

475
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,960
little bit

476
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,510
my forensics guys they're gonna go into

477
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,460
town because once you have the image

478
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,990
there it's pretty much you know that's

479
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,000
what a lot of forensics

480
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,680
you know processes do is there you're

481
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,810
scanning em you know those images making

482
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:16,410
sure that you have that you can extract

483
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:18,810
up streams of mutexes and all sorts of

484
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,070
really good juicy information so when

485
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,179
you're looking into lists of IRC

486
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,590
figuring out how to use them

487
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,990
I understand that some of them are the

488
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,520
blue team and for ongoing monitoring and

489
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,880
some of them are eager for your

490
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:33,120
forensics and and then your forensics

491
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,920
team are going to help you feed these

492
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,590
IDs back into your system records are

493
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,420
going to get to get this set up so that

494
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,000
you're actually you're creating your own

495
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,610
IRC is 94 all right so let's talk about

496
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,960
diving a couple things more in detail so

497
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:50,850
IP addresses best best way you know an

498
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,300
easiest way of getting I started without

499
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:56,490
seasons into proxy logs your fire alarms

500
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:00,540
get a list of bad IP addresses with me

501
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:01,980
is the Zeus list still advanced over

502
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,960
thing right so we can still have we

503
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,020
stopped Zeus infections out there and so

504
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:10,710
there's a specific open-source IRC for

505
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:12,060
Zeus and in matchup so if I got

506
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,650
connection up to the side beef dress

507
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,450
that that means that guys defected right

508
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,220
so I'm going to automate that and

509
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:21,900
automatically reimage that guys left

510
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:23,280
officers he sends a ID arrested here we

511
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,830
got the choke you didn't choke the

512
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,860
problem is is that IP address

513
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:32,189
io C's has an extremely low fidelity and

514
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:35,520
so much that I say don't use them in

515
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:38,730
this manner all right so I went in this

516
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,030
is just crap alright IOC's

517
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:45,270
I because this is more like security

518
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:48,000
intelligence right this is more context

519
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,549
if you're soon or your ability to

520
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,289
monitor

521
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:52,179
has a way of like coloring they're

522
00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:55,419
having context to the traffic coming in

523
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:58,209
I wouldn't have the tag saying that this

524
00:22:55,419 --> 00:23:03,879
this is this IP address has been known

525
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:06,219
to okay then you can start doing some of

526
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:09,299
the thread hunting but do not do any

527
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:11,589
type of automatic ticket creation or

528
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:13,209
metrics or anything based on this

529
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:15,428
because you're gonna look like you're

530
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:16,719
completely home now if you're trying to

531
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:18,580
get security funding and that's what you

532
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:20,440
want to do then that's correct doctor

533
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,049
but unless you're you know you're just

534
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,529
trying to budge the numbers absolutely

535
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:28,359
avoid IP addresses so in domain names

536
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:32,559
this is another one that comes down in

537
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:34,389
the investigation on this but I think

538
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,119
there's a pretty good information about

539
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:41,859
how to do domain name IRCs

540
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:44,889
one thing I work for a company that like

541
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:48,070
just a company but love to block these

542
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:50,258
top-level domains dot whatever is bad

543
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,899
right we kind of a couple of attacks

544
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:54,609
with duct band so let's just walk about

545
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,988
man right so I think vocalist

546
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:58,439
information now this one this is the

547
00:23:55,989 --> 00:24:01,059
state has fairly recent from the

548
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,320
anti-phishing working group they showed

549
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:03,190
us that the you know for the last

550
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,589
quarter of last year

551
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:08,979
over half of the stuff that we're

552
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:11,789
getting from phishing attacks the calm

553
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:15,009
and then what's called the traditional

554
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:16,329
TLDs that because 2002 before they

555
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:19,450
started creating that with new weird

556
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:22,329
ones all over haven't been coming back

557
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:25,749
and the other one of the other gray

558
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:29,149
slice there is country level UK

559
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:30,739
there are some things so vast majority

560
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:34,779
of even the fishing attacks are still

561
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:39,589
using standard top-level domains is not

562
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:41,359
necessarily a good Fedeli there so so

563
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:43,009
push back under Persephone just block

564
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,668
top-level domains there's really no

565
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:49,609
reason to do that but new domains are

566
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:52,039
evil I try to find some good day on this

567
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:54,949
this the this anti vision workers

568
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,359
stop collecting information to 2016 I'd

569
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,729
seen something recently but couldn't

570
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:00,769
find it for this presentation but this

571
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:02,599
this situation has only got a little bit

572
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:05,119
worse but you can see from this data and

573
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:07,399
you can see the data but it basically

574
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:10,908
shows that the highest bar there says

575
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:14,658
that my oldest domains is between three

576
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:17,259
days or one week I've seen data that

577
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:19,459
shows that that now we're up to like

578
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:22,489
between you know like three days ago

579
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:25,729
like 72 hours is like the average

580
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:29,269
lifetime for fishing domain they pop

581
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:30,559
them up they send the emails out and you

582
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:34,070
know our stock is pretty good about

583
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,749
right now fishing take down go risk IQ

584
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:39,019
or whatever going to use don't take down

585
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:43,369
those fenders but the thing is is that

586
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:45,619
that is that that's not a good use of

587
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:48,439
viruses because you know necessarily is

588
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:51,070
this is that you've got the process of

589
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,029
getting all these domains up to this

590
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,129
street Intel company that's going to

591
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:58,549
feed you all these domains they're going

592
00:25:55,129 --> 00:26:03,079
to be gone and within a couple days so

593
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:05,029
domains eternal is low fidelity but that

594
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:07,519
if you have a process of being able to

595
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:08,700
look at the age of that domain in real

596
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,830
time as you're doing

597
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,590
you're proxying and you're blocking this

598
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:16,710
could be a way of easily solving some of

599
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,789
the phishing attack problems all right

600
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,480
so

601
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:23,609
Wow hashes so this is a bad guy he's

602
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,059
been used in lots of attacks eighty one

603
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:31,109
eighty twenty to eight between so you

604
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:33,239
should definitely block the tension okay

605
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:36,980
just block it I actually went to a

606
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:39,889
company had this set to wooden blocked

607
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:44,659
but it was locked down it looked like a

608
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:50,639
question of domain GPL object out says

609
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:52,950
all the administrators can run even like

610
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:54,539
WinZip install using that is a

611
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,309
everything uses that that you see but

612
00:26:54,539 --> 00:27:00,179
the point is is that you know there is a

613
00:26:56,309 --> 00:27:02,119
limitation on using box especially if

614
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:05,159
you're going to start generating around

615
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:06,330
so don't get overzealous and start you

616
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,549
know I'm making a lot of this because

617
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:12,330
you'll end up blocking something very

618
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:14,749
important now one way that we get fixes

619
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:17,699
is if you're checking for certificate

620
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:19,940
right I'm looking at this is signed by

621
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,940
Microsoft

622
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:29,850
alright stop using md5 every company

623
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:32,668
every tool and I've got will use md5

624
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:35,158
everybody still can process in d5 the

625
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:35,749
mess and my security controls and

626
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,230
everything like that

627
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:41,580
they can use but if we stop using it

628
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,739
they will stop making them stop

629
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,970
supporting and so let's all just to

630
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:50,340
ensure that we are released using

631
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:52,880
sha-256 and then I obviously use a fuzzy

632
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:55,310
hat this is the particularly when you're

633
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,530
you know actual malware that does volume

634
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,850
or big words maybe we've looked a little

635
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,889
bit different

636
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,580
they're also creating some good research

637
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:06,380
on fuzzy hashes for all the word and

638
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,990
macro viruses so we're having to deal

639
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:15,080
with so definitely look into that so

640
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:16,970
again the bridge tests and you have

641
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,570
probably done this process but then I

642
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:24,740
get it is that you take your gold image

643
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:27,889
whatever scan and put all those known

644
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,330
good hashes into your database so when

645
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,610
you're creating your honor seon-young

646
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:34,790
plan is that you're creating all these

647
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:36,169
IRCs from always the virus detection and

648
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:39,440
ETR don't like that you're feeding all

649
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:41,420
these known bad do you know milk your

650
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,790
own duck understand what your known good

651
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,710
as yell up lots of software out there

652
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:48,470
that you're probably developed a drone

653
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:50,270
you know get them get a process in you

654
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,040
start scanning those hashes as they're

655
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,650
pushed up to your environment the other

656
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,149
SCC young or whatever automation and get

657
00:28:54,650 --> 00:29:00,740
make sure you know what you're going to

658
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:03,920
do this so all of this you know like I

659
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:06,830
was describing to a non late word minute

660
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,730
or late my personal about what you know

661
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:15,409
what is next-gen Amy

662
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:17,600
alright well looks at the painting their

663
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:21,260
stuff and signature the signatures

664
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,780
values a signature like a you mean the

665
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,370
hash or the signature and so make sure

666
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:29,660
that you understand that if you set up

667
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:31,370
your eat our EDR tool and pretty much

668
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:35,510
the only feature you're using on that is

669
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:37,760
to look for in scan your your your files

670
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,770
and then check against by our struggle

671
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,820
or something like that you're doing

672
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:46,379
something slightly worse than old lady

673
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,510
so this is not you know

674
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:51,840
for you straights is not going to bring

675
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:54,750
much value and so not to say that it's

676
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,129
not part of a complete breakfast but it

677
00:29:54,750 --> 00:30:00,350
is something that you don't want to do

678
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:11,250
only so while I gave IP addresses the

679
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:13,590
crack I'm thinking all right so I you

680
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:15,179
know I I was looking through this you

681
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,658
know living through this this situation

682
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:20,880
a couple years back we were going from

683
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:22,590
you know they kind of static signature

684
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,500
based detection isms in the CPR world of

685
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:28,049
doing these cave your own base attacks

686
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,690
and so you know as we're looking at our

687
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:33,000
sees I also like to describe you know

688
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:35,340
behaviors of compromise because I our

689
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,980
season in today's world generally means

690
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,379
this atomic indicator when somebody says

691
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,960
give me the IFC's they expect a list of

692
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,320
things like passions and I keep us in

693
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,120
the domains but when you hit someone for

694
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,470
my archives in here my friends discuss

695
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:54,840
this is what we need meat behaviors of

696
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:57,210
compromise because this is what's going

697
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,149
to help us detect the next attack

698
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,380
all right and these are just examples I

699
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,870
won't read through them but you can see

700
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,640
the the idea here and this is a lot of

701
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:09,209
what the you know media products are

702
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:11,700
trying to figure out is how do we get

703
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:14,490
these behavioral analysis down and find

704
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,590
out what is bad you know old school and

705
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:18,840
then we can I used to use a lot to kind

706
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:21,350
of explain the one of the bad behavior

707
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,840
is is executing how to the recycle bin

708
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:26,340
that shouldn't happen right and so those

709
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,260
are the type of behaviors that we can

710
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,970
look for and those are the things that

711
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,350
we need to start triggering on as

712
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:34,140
opposed to just

713
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:37,379
my indicators now this has evolved and

714
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,540
one vendor that has come up with

715
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,890
indicators of attacks and start using

716
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,690
this term so we're going to go ahead and

717
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:45,090
give that lip service because you hear

718
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,860
it I like that you know because I've

719
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:50,340
been talking but behavior rules

720
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:52,740
compromise the viruses because these

721
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,720
then they come up with a highway so

722
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,220
they've got a lot more but the marketing

723
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,770
budget so I'm sure that you'll probably

724
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,600
hear indicators of attacking exercise

725
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:02,460
opposed to behaviors of compromised

726
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,730
buddies that your actual here indicator

727
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,950
attack by comma by and eyebrows right

728
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:13,200
but the same idea that is there is that

729
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:16,230
you can basically capture the the way

730
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,530
that software runs and compare against

731
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:23,130
what no good software activity is and

732
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:26,720
get those actual actions down and those

733
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:29,670
it's that so about the behavioral

734
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,380
analysis two indicators of attack and

735
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:35,090
then we come involved to this point

736
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:37,320
where minors released this is an attack

737
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:40,110
framework and I think it looks really

738
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,800
good because it is a nice evolution of

739
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,959
where we're gone

740
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,730
and it talks a lot about what we call

741
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,760
techniques tactics and procedures

742
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:50,570
TTP's won't be cool like oh man I guess

743
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:55,110
my OCD is because of TTP's

744
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:57,780
alright so tactics in general is what is

745
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,939
a bad guy trying to do right what's

746
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,590
their tactic here a couple of examples

747
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:05,220
here and this is from the miner a

748
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:06,750
website that you can look out beyond

749
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,200
trying to gain persistence trying to

750
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,200
execute

751
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:16,149
vulnerability privilege escalations we

752
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:18,519
can tie that together with techniques

753
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:21,219
right so how are they doing it so that

754
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:23,140
the attacker was trying to do an

755
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,850
escalation of privileges but how do they

756
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:28,510
do it what's the technique that they use

757
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:31,480
all right so the point of the mine

758
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:33,580
framework is to give all of us a common

759
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:37,059
way of talking about this because if we

760
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:39,010
looked at a lot of our reports when I go

761
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:40,539
back to the gun I have that behavior all

762
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,700
compromised I had some behaviors

763
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:43,480
described there what each of us did use

764
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,190
different words

765
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,080
when you wanted like to start creating

766
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,679
metrics about what is the most common

767
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,000
behavior or indicator of attack we need

768
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:55,440
a common language and that's what the

769
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,789
miner group is done is given us a set of

770
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,909
common languages here we can start tying

771
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:05,110
things and understanding you know how we

772
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:08,250
need to prioritize so here's the example

773
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:10,929
con ties it together right so this is a

774
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:13,540
register key so my writing to Bridget

775
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:17,020
Ricki and so it gives us this level of

776
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:21,070
detail and this you can you can see the

777
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:26,710
value of this compared to somebody wrote

778
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:29,800
to this particular key my friends expose

779
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:37,570
how many places can you start put

780
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:38,830
something in the start cheer anybody how

781
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:42,550
many different keys we got I mean

782
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:51,159
there's the user hi you know there's

783
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:52,690
gonna be tested everybody so instead of

784
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:54,099
describing those and saying that them

785
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,349
you know they use these different keys

786
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:57,720
we can more you know more aptly

787
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:00,270
described that they

788
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:04,649
this is the tactic and technique

789
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:07,440
abilities so the reason I bring this up

790
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:09,060
in this song is really you know you're

791
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,710
probably having to deal with I are

792
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,060
sisters you got management says we need

793
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,589
to do our season and you've got

794
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,960
regulators that expect you to do my

795
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:18,119
receipts and so which IRC should you use

796
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:23,790
well you can start with no well I've got

797
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:25,829
a 500 so left or do you take a step back

798
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:28,650
and say I pay for all of this you know

799
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:31,380
or a future or anomaly attacks they have

800
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:35,640
also the mystery told you pretty good

801
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:37,589
idea who's after me who my attackers

802
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,650
might be and I can look at the tactics

803
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:42,029
and techniques they've previously used

804
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:46,220
and then I can prioritize it and I can

805
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:51,030
say hey boss we don't have a good way of

806
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:53,578
looking for finances and an order

807
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:56,819
knowing when my run registry treaty has

808
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:58,470
been headed so I need investment here

809
00:35:56,819 --> 00:36:00,569
and here's the proof that we need some

810
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,549
type of tool is that look at all of

811
00:36:00,569 --> 00:36:03,810
these groups and I pick up dust on a

812
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,609
slide that I lost when I was editing

813
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:07,828
this earlier is that on the miter site

814
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:09,779
they're all the different groups and

815
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:11,609
they showed like just just like this

816
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,609
they show the different types of

817
00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:18,180
techniques their menus you say you know

818
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:20,369
see so you are afraid the fuzzy wasn't

819
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,980
there and you want us to defend against

820
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:24,839
it we need a tool to be able to detect

821
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,490
these attacks the techniques and I've

822
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,410
got this highlighted for you

823
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:30,060
they've got if you haven't been to the

824
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,759
mitre site yet they're gonna slice of

825
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:35,250
the goodness screen up in this like

826
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,960
flexible application that you can create

827
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:41,730
your own colors and dragging all the

828
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:44,579
maps and success get all your projects

829
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:48,390
funded all right so so which one is this

830
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:50,550
it is a TT TT PS or iris ease right well

831
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,900
let's do it you can use both right I

832
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,970
don't want you to go back to this and

833
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,650
saying well Xavier said honors using

834
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,299
perhaps oh we should stop using them all

835
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:59,640
right I'm saying that higher seats are

836
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,930
perhaps you should minimize using them

837
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,640
but this is the tool

838
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,440
skander he has been published by

839
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,500
fighters one minutes on the minor github

840
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,000
as well and will allows you to kind of

841
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:14,970
mix and match and start playing around

842
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:19,809
with being able to use TTP's and Isis

843
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:23,290
alright so in summary so I see matching

844
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:25,150
is you know a necessary evil there are

845
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:28,089
some times we can provide yourself with

846
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:29,920
some extreme high fidelity stuff there

847
00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:34,270
are a lot of places where it gives you

848
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,339
middling fidelity and can really throw

849
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:42,849
off metrics and the understanding of

850
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:45,790
others about how bad things are very

851
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:47,589
atomic very situational make sure that

852
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:50,680
you have to do that that you're using in

853
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:53,500
the IMC's appropriately TTP analytics

854
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,569
this is where you are stepping you know

855
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,550
other level and really talking about

856
00:37:55,569 --> 00:38:00,759
what the attacker is trying to do and

857
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:03,609
how they're doing it and this is allows

858
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,619
for a you know more you know broader

859
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:10,740
conversation on the protecting your

860
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:13,540
enterprise and allows for you know lower

861
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:18,009
clock and you know lower quantity entire

862
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:19,630
quality results all right well I'll had

863
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:22,089
a couple of you falsely but I appreciate

864
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:25,240
you saying and I sticking around you

865
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:34,500
have any questions to me I'll be around

866
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:34,500
for the rest of day thank you very much
