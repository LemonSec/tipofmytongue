about them so just real quick this is

20
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:15,640
what we're gonna be talking about don't

21
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:17,469
want to spend too much time on the

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,780
agenda but mostly we're going to define

23
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:21,429
what cyber talking is we're going to

24
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,899
define the difference between trolling

25
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,170
and cyber stalking talk to you about

26
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:28,360
some just stats we're also going to look

27
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,030
at some terms in terms of services for

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,789
some social media platforms and the

29
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,549
applicable laws both federal and state

30
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:35,600
and then

31
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:39,950
potential solutions and recommendations

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,509
for how to alleviate I'm just going to

33
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,890
hold all the questions until the end of

34
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:45,110
the presentations and we should have

35
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:49,850
about five to ten minutes or so to ask

36
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:54,100
me whatever you want so raise your hand

37
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,100
if you actually care about cyber stop

38
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:04,549
those minions now raise your hand again

39
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:10,880
if you know anyone or have been cyber

40
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:13,099
stalked before okay raise your hand

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:19,180
again if you know what steps to take to

42
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:21,319
address cyber stalking sorry about that

43
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,489
okay raise your hand if you know the

44
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:31,369
steps to address cyber sake okay that's

45
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:35,930
what we're going to talk about so what

46
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:40,190
is cyber stalking this is actually

47
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,170
defined by the this is actually the

48
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,989
definition by the national conference

49
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,940
phase of literature legislature and this

50
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:48,889
is what is written in the law of what

51
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,230
cyber stalking is it's basically the use

52
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:53,030
of the internet or anything

53
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:56,600
telecommunications to cost credible

54
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:59,889
threat and what does that actually mean

55
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,888
we don't really know

56
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:06,220
so there is a difference between

57
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,110
trolling in cyber something a lot of

58
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,890
people actually like to conflate those

59
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:14,319
two terms trolling is in essence just

60
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,260
basically being mean online or saying

61
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,869
something inappropriate on a comment on

62
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:23,010
Twitter or LinkedIn which I don't see a

63
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:26,260
lot of charlie happily on LinkedIn but

64
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,760
whatever methods in control but the

65
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,260
difference between Cypress and

66
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,179
controlling that's really important here

67
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,149
is trolling typically does not cause

68
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,040
harm or physical harm and cyber stalking

69
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,290
starts usually online in the mid

70
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,349
actually transitions into physical

71
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,269
threats and a lot of people don't know

72
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,638
what happens once it moves from the

73
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:52,209
digital space into the actual physical

74
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:55,590
space so we're going to talk about

75
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,590
social media usage and

76
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:05,150
but a lot of cyber stalking takes place

77
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,350
on social media bad actors huge whatever

78
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,480
information you put out there from

79
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,370
yourself to actually create and launch

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,109
the cyber stalking campaigns against you

81
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:17,108
so the majority of the recon is passive

82
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,850
which means that you don't know

83
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:21,469
whoever's conducting this research on

84
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,510
you and a couple people have come up to

85
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:26,450
me based on my social media and said

86
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,710
yeah I looked you up I don't think you

87
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,740
should tell someone that you looked them

88
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:33,770
up in the conversation very

89
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,650
uncomfortable thereafter but so that's

90
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,570
basically how a lot of cyber stalking

91
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,239
campaigns start it's usually past it and

92
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:43,640
then whoever wants to against be

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,920
malicious then it turns into in want of

94
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:51,440
a harassment in the native eventually

95
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:53,360
gradually turns into physical threats so

96
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,950
here are some social media statistics

97
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,700
that you may or may not have been aware

98
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:00,680
of Facebook and this information was as

99
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,539
of March 1st 2019

100
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,880
this information actually changes every

101
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,669
month because they're doing polls every

102
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,400
month or so to kind of figure out how

103
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:13,760
many people are using social media so as

104
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:18,200
of March 2 point 3 2 million activity

105
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,930
monthly our lodging in 1.5 two billion

106
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,909
users are logging in daily and those two

107
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,650
numbers actually combine to create about

108
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,440
thirty percent of the global population

109
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,609
and if you guys remember that number

110
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,650
that seven points that are the billion

111
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,060
people across the world so Facebook is

112
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,469
seeing about thirty percent of the

113
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:37,130
world's population logging in on a

114
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,890
monthly or daily basis five new profiles

115
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,360
are created a second which five new

116
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,030
profiles just got created in that little

117
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,640
pod that I took two hundred and seventy

118
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:50,390
million profiles are fake on Facebook

119
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,830
and for LinkedIn the numbers are quite

120
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,020
different because there is not as many

121
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,609
profiles there are only about five

122
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,039
hundred and ninety million users on

123
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:01,130
LinkedIn two hundred and sixty of those

124
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,870
are active monthly users and then two

125
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,870
new profiles are created a second one

126
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,710
relates only about ten percent and I say

127
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,000
that because it's much less than

128
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:17,450
Facebook but that's about fifty nine

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:24,200
million accounts 5908 five million

130
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:26,120
accounts are fake accounts on engine so

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,890
this slide actually says sharing is

132
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,190
consistent for what it really means is

133
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:34,460
over sharing statistics so one of four

134
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,599
users are sharing Geo

135
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,330
attacking themselves when they actually

136
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:42,839
enter into a new location this is

137
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:46,169
typically done on Facebook 63% of social

138
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:49,110
media users post clear up date of birth

139
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,938
61% have their name the location of the

140
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,339
schools that they attend high school or

141
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,589
universities 23% have their pet names

142
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:58,409
and I'll drop down to 48 percent half

143
00:06:55,589 --> 00:07:00,089
their hometown information and everyone

144
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,998
in the room knows that this information

145
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:06,240
is basically used to reset your

146
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:08,610
passwords or it's utilized for some of

147
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,430
the know your customer type of questions

148
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,659
that you can answer and so you pretty

149
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,120
much if you had to need this information

150
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:16,919
on your social media profiles you have

151
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,569
given a bad actor all the information

152
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:22,099
they need to essentially reset your

153
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:28,379
passwords and/or be able to cyber sake

154
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:32,449
so with that being said terms I think

155
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:32,449
the plight function is enabled

156
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,160
I took that off but I guess it

157
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,270
[Laughter]

158
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:29,010
all right so in terms of services this

159
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:32,550
is basically the terms of services are

160
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:35,069
essentially the part of your agreement

161
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:38,010
when you use social media that no one

162
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,780
actually ever reads I know I haven't

163
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,250
read most of mine but through this

164
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,670
presentation I actually did started

165
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,950
reading some of the terms of services

166
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:48,719
and it's actually quite important that

167
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,310
you do take time to read them as people

168
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,340
who are giving your information out to

169
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:56,900
these social media platforms so this is

170
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:01,940
actually screen grab from LinkedIn and

171
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,939
this is part of what your three to win

172
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,430
nice you have to play

173
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,910
I have to say this makes me look very

174
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,910
technology there it is

175
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,250
no I'm not I'm sorry

176
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:27,050
yeah what which is basically create a

177
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,720
false identity or a fake account this is

178
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,760
the only part of LinkedIn user agreement

179
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,520
that actually talks about fake accounts

180
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,020
nowhere else only user agreement or the

181
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,170
privacy policy actually use state to

182
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:43,340
this and it's one really long sentence

183
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:45,770
with no period if you just wanted to

184
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:49,780
show you guys that if you have some time

185
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,780
we really take a look at what your

186
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:59,730
the terms of courtesy so here is another

187
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,189
screen wrap from the privacy policy from

188
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,650
LinkedIn this is actually stating what

189
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:08,480
LinkedIn is willing to do if they

190
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:11,699
identify any fraud or fake profiles and

191
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,680
essentially there is no section in the

192
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,540
privacy policy or in the User Agreement

193
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,939
that says when we then actually does

194
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,849
once we've identified a fake profile so

195
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,620
in order for me to find this report fake

196
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,990
profiles I actually have to search for I

197
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,380
went in and I detecting reporting a fake

198
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,840
profile and this is what came up and

199
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,780
throughout researching the remaining

200
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,000
user agreements or the privacy policies

201
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,890
I actually didn't see what LinkedIn does

202
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,810
after usually reported does anyone

203
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:43,500
actually know what happens after you

204
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:45,469
report a fake profile on LinkedIn come

205
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,930
back I didn't think so either

206
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:51,240
and this is another portion of their

207
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,859
privacy policy and this essentially

208
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,050
which is why you should probably read

209
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,270
this it tells you what you are entitled

210
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,370
to as a user giving you LinkedIn your

211
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:01,740
data so you can ask them to them each

212
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,450
change correct or you can object to your

213
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,720
data being shared with any of their

214
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:09,030
third parties including LinkedIn interim

215
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,890
services because LinkedIn actually

216
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,420
shares data with other LinkedIn services

217
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,230
that you may not have a son had signed

218
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:19,650
up for so reading your privacy policy is

219
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,120
quite important so why am I talking to

220
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,430
you a bunch of currency policies to talk

221
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,880
about cyber stalking because this is the

222
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,530
only

223
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,140
they go on social media that actually

224
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:30,839
gives you any rights or tells you what

225
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,370
you can can't do with your own data so

226
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,270
if you don't want your information out

227
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,710
there for someone to be able to misuse

228
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,160
this is the only thing that's kind of

229
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,160
helping either

230
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:52,339
so now let's go back to cyber stopping

231
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:55,430
an applicable laws so for those of you

232
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:57,709
that were honest about you know caring

233
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,329
about the topic or not caring which like

234
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:01,910
I think for people in totally that

235
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:04,699
didn't care which happy you guys

236
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:08,680
actually care about my topic for those

237
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:10,099
four people that didn't actually have to

238
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,310
care about it

239
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,779
this is why you should 65% of Internet

240
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,369
users between eighteen to twenty

241
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:18,680
twenty-nine have experienced online

242
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,360
harassing harassment I know I have and

243
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,399
some people raise their hands in the air

244
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,079
actions that people do so you should

245
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,560
understand what this is a very important

246
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,508
topic

247
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,489
twenty six percent about twenty six

248
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:30,949
percent of women between ages of 18 and

249
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:33,230
24 said they have been cyber stopped and

250
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:35,630
25 percent of women on the internet have

251
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,790
experienced severe sexual harassment or

252
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:41,029
sexual harassment as a result of their

253
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:43,819
cyber stalking so the majority of people

254
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:47,060
women who are being cyber soft and

255
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:49,160
things like work a good number of them

256
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:53,589
are experiencing physical and sexual

257
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,589
harm as a result of the cyber sake

258
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,240
and lastly 8% of Americans have been

259
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:02,759
stopped online it doesn't seem like a

260
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,620
big number but it's pretty significant

261
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:09,209
in terms of cyber stopping wasn't even a

262
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,160
term about two or three years ago so so

263
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:14,699
here the federal laws that are in place

264
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:18,120
today that actually kind of address this

265
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:21,540
or somewhat address it so the Computer

266
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,300
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1956 which is a

267
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,269
pretty old law seeing that cyber

268
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,639
stalking is normal there's more current

269
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:32,610
than this law has been actually in terms

270
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,410
of updated so just quickly walk through

271
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,880
I'll walk through some of the

272
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:39,719
information that I found out about these

273
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:42,050
laws I'm not too much to you but this

274
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,639
was actually put in place the computer

275
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:48,060
actually put in place just to counteract

276
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,040
history so for the large majority of the

277
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,969
last year's what cyber stalking

278
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,209
everything that was being persecuted

279
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:58,980
under this law which there wasn't any

280
00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:01,229
real consequences for cyber stuff and

281
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,180
still not have been went on I guess

282
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:07,200
there were no consequences

283
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:11,040
recently so for the u.s. code 18 section

284
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,660
2 2 6 1 aim this actually there's law

285
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,670
that has been put in place for cyber

286
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,199
stalking and it's basically written for

287
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,390
domestic violence and stalking and

288
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,190
there's a very small so that the subset

289
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,370
of that lava talks about the electronic

290
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:26,460
communications services being used to

291
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:29,340
perform domestic violence for stopping

292
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,080
so it's not it's still not very clear

293
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,340
that it's specifically for cyber sake is

294
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:37,410
for physical abuse and physical stalking

295
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,970
and then one that I think is really

296
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,339
important to point out here is the

297
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:44,520
infringement copyright and this actually

298
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:46,560
has been used recently for things for

299
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,750
cases such as like revenge porn where

300
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,900
someone is using your own photographer

301
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:55,050
nude photos or explicit photos against

302
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,360
you in an activist foundation so this

303
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,609
actually does it put anyone in prison it

304
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,340
just makes it so that the victim was the

305
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:05,550
original creator of the photograph to be

306
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,200
able to sue that person so this is

307
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,750
actually kind of a good thing but it

308
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,370
doesn't actually give any money legal

309
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,530
authority to put you in jail for a sham

310
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,450
your nude photographs which I think we

311
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,459
still have a long way to go and then

312
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:21,030
lastly the Communications Decency Act

313
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,970
section 230 that is really important to

314
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:25,980
talk about here because this section of

315
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,380
this Act actually makes it so that

316
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,389
social media platforms are not

317
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,519
responsible for

318
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:34,889
using their fat one to launch a cyber

319
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,389
stalking campaign against you so what

320
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:37,589
that means is that someone who decides

321
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:40,410
that they want to stop you

322
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:43,829
Facebook has no responsibility for

323
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:45,449
anything within you and this part is

324
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:47,969
actually a big problem because this is

325
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:48,990
why cyber stalking is not being

326
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:54,569
persecuted on the right there in the

327
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:56,579
regular basis so then there in the

328
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:58,889
recent years there have been some new

329
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:01,258
state laws that have been I guess

330
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:03,930
published or written to kind of address

331
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:06,659
this California which seems to be a

332
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,280
leader in a lot of privacy law they have

333
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:11,100
recently well they actually were the

334
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:17,099
first state to create a cyber stalking

335
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:20,240
law and that was in 1991 and the Texas

336
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:22,469
followed shortly in 2000 with their uh

337
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,659
that's actually called stalking by

338
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:28,439
Electronic Communications Act since 2001

339
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:30,929
and lastly there are forty five stalking

340
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:34,110
laws that existed in the u.s. only about

341
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:35,640
18 of them don't incorporate minors so

342
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,979
what that means is that majority of

343
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:44,940
these laws are only applicable if you're

344
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:47,960
under the age of 18 so let's talk about

345
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:52,380
the previous cases that were actually

346
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,090
tried so just quickly right through this

347
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,690
actually under Massachusetts right

348
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,238
Iceland

349
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,340
25 he launched a cyber stalking campaign

350
00:17:57,239 --> 00:18:03,119
against his former housemate who I

351
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:06,840
believe was also paid back in the span

352
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:09,509
of a year so he made over 120 bomb

353
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,389
threats he called the FBI and indicated

354
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:14,429
that she was making bombs at her home he

355
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:17,129
launched the campaign against her mother

356
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:19,379
her friends are known associates he

357
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:22,349
posted nude photographs of her online

358
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:25,769
create a fake facebook profile of her

359
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:27,210
he sent child pornographic photos to her

360
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:30,889
family her friends and her known

361
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:34,080
associates and he even posted her

362
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:37,469
address and her information on websites

363
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,629
for men that were known for supporting

364
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,489
domestic violence so this caused for

365
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:45,330
strangers to show that her home and

366
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:47,879
actually caused her physical on so at

367
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,859
the end of the sentence and he was 17

368
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:52,529
years in prison with five years of

369
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:53,849
supervised release I want to call out

370
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:55,919
that the reason why this was actually

371
00:18:53,849 --> 00:19:01,889
investigated by the FBI was struggling

372
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:03,629
because of 120 Bumpus the second case

373
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:06,359
I'm going to talk about just recently

374
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:08,219
happened this is one Thomas in a very

375
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,080
nice that he's from st. Louis

376
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,679
but the ciphers not me actually happened

377
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,830
anymore he launched a campaign against

378
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,779
his ex-girlfriend in Rochester Rossi and

379
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:21,269
they actually met on an online dating

380
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,480
site and so they were dating for a

381
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:25,450
period of a year

382
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,540
and together more and want Thompson just

383
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:31,090
if I was a reporter so he was able to

384
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:35,139
get a lot of information on his victims

385
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:38,260
just by using his his resources means

386
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:41,200
the reporter so he posted her home

387
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:47,169
address he basically did similar to

388
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,820
similar things as the previous you

389
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:50,919
posted her old address in multiple

390
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,470
places people came to her home listed

391
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:56,260
sex from her folks anonymous reports

392
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,000
where they need of her threatening

393
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,940
police and running guns in about the

394
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,120
country since they were so close to

395
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,370
Canada

396
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,469
he made 12 bomb threats to Jewish

397
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:08,250
community centers and he was only

398
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:12,090
sentenced to three years in prison again

399
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:14,230
this was actually reported by the victim

400
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,409
this was actually reported by the victim

401
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,630
12 times in a year and a half and this

402
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,309
was only investigated once he started

403
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:25,210
threatening

404
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:29,110
JCC's so a lot of these cases have only

405
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:31,720
been have only the effect results only

406
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:33,699
because they're bomb threats or they're

407
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,090
physical threats of violence to children

408
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,210
or schools or other religious

409
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:42,070
affiliations

410
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:44,710
and organizations I should say so some

411
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:47,379
of the challenges in proposed solutions

412
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:52,270
which it's up to you to decide if that's

413
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:54,450
an actual solution or not so one of the

414
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,780
challenges is

415
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,910
act 2:30 does not hold websites

416
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,920
accountable for the content that's

417
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,600
posted by their users there's actually a

418
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,970
big problem because in law enforcement

419
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,370
does want to actually start

420
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,500
investigating it makes it hard for them

421
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,510
because these social media platforms do

422
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,940
not have to cooperate with the

423
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:17,910
investigations in terms of mobile even

424
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,910
if they only are required to to

425
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:23,730
cooperate if it's basically and being

426
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,830
investigated by the FBI social media

427
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,900
platforms cannot control fake profiles

428
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:31,379
being created a lot of cyber stalking

429
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:33,540
campaigns use vacant profiles to collect

430
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,580
information on their victims or to post

431
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:39,120
photographs or text messages of their

432
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,949
victims reporting fake profiles have

433
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,270
basically doesn't have any clear actions

434
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,400
no one knows what happens once the

435
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:47,040
reports fake profile I've recorded

436
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,620
profiles and then I go back and check a

437
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,889
month later they're still there so I'm

438
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,330
assuming nothing happened over a sharing

439
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,640
of your personal information this is

440
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:59,280
something that we can control as

441
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,140
consumers whatever you put out there

442
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,020
just know that someone else to this is

443
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,380
able to consume it and the local and

444
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,170
state law enforcement they don't have it

445
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,220
seems like they don't have intended

446
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,920
to investigate or they don't have the

447
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:20,210
resources to properly investigate some

448
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:22,820
of these so here's where I recommend for

449
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,860
users and a lot a lot of what I'm gonna

450
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,720
recommend today is one to be what we can

451
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,629
do as consumers of social media to

452
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,490
protect ourselves so reducing your flip

453
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,530
crown Google and what that means is that

454
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,300
Google yourself if you don't like the

455
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,530
information that's on there try to get

456
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,149
something been taken down and you

457
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:41,770
probably won't be able to get all of it

458
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:44,090
but as much as you can taking down do so

459
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:46,460
change privacy settings on your social

460
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,959
media platforms I personally have

461
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,940
removed all of my information from

462
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,040
message media no one knows my date of

463
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,960
birth is unless I tell them no one knows

464
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,930
how old I have no one even knows my real

465
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:00,830
name so these are just things that I do

466
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:02,780
to protect myself and don't share your

467
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,250
order to accompany information that is

468
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,620
kind of difficult on platforms like

469
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,720
LinkedIn but what I would recommend is

470
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,520
maybe not post your work phone number to

471
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,120
work email if you don't want people just

472
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:17,900
calling you up and require post-tax

473
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:20,570
order prior to being posted use your

474
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,030
block and report features as often as

475
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,310
possible and read your privacy policies

476
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,870
in your terms and conditions I think

477
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,440
that's really important to actually know

478
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,439
what your rights are

479
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,970
now what I recommend for law enforcement

480
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,790
this is actually going to be something

481
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:41,100
that is quite expensive and

482
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,200
time-consuming to action event a lot of

483
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:46,620
state and local law enforcement do not

484
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,020
have enough resources even people

485
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,449
running for technical skills to actually

486
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,580
have additional incentive 16 but imagine

487
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,470
if all of the people who are affording

488
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,120
cyberstalking we had a team that could

489
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,309
go back and kind of do some

490
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,379
investigative investigations to identify

491
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:02,879
who was behind it maybe some of these

492
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,250
wouldn't have to get to the point where

493
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,470
comments are being made so some of the

494
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,200
tools I recommend be this is not an

495
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,270
exhaustive list obviously a pool and a

496
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,309
try be tracking being you attract

497
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:16,679
someone via their app you can kind of

498
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:18,178
help you figure out who's behind it and

499
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,309
then kind of create a profile to further

500
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:22,950
investigate and the rest of these are

501
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:25,470
basically tracking as well but both

502
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:28,400
extractor is specific as a function

503
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:30,570
where you can search social media

504
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,230
specifically since a lot of cyber

505
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,230
stalking happen

506
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:44,480
so for policy recommendations so

507
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,700
continued advocacy first Irish knocking

508
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,350
laws there needs to be some sort of

509
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,720
bridge between state and local and

510
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:54,740
federal I don't believe that it exists

511
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:57,620
for the feds for the feds to come in at

512
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,480
any point where there may be a bomb

513
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,459
being made I think some of this can

514
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,730
happen can be investigated prior to that

515
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,730
so figuring out how to bridge the gap

516
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:09,560
between state local and federal updating

517
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,710
or performing existing laws and I

518
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,750
mentioned only about 18 of the 45 laws

519
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,490
and related impacts can actually be

520
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:20,330
applicable to cyber stalking for adults

521
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:22,340
that's a problem because 25 percent as I

522
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,419
mentioned in the previous slide about 25

523
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,500
percent of people

524
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:29,420
being softer over the age of 18 and call

525
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,490
former Communications Decency Act

526
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,380
because we need to have social media

527
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,760
platforms being held accountable for the

528
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:43,340
information that's being posted on there

529
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:47,090
and how it's being used now that one a

530
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:49,760
lot of people probably won't know but

531
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:52,280
giving users more control on how their

532
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,080
data is being published used and then

533
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,490
being able to opt out of their

534
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:02,330
information being shared is actually

535
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:05,960
quite important kind of being invisible

536
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:08,540
to the internet board people want to

537
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,550
launch campaigns against you and just as

538
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,500
an FYI most people who have been cyber

539
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,760
stalked have their cyber started because

540
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,670
of someone through someone that they

541
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,950
know and only about 26% of the people

542
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:21,950
who have been cyberstalk via strangers

543
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:28,120
so it's someone that you know that's

544
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:33,590
probably it has been internet and lastly

545
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:36,649
you or someone that you know here the

546
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,899
resources that you can use workings who

547
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:41,360
halts online abuse actually lists out

548
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:51,760
all the states that have cyber stalking

549
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:51,760
laws they also have actually helped

550
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,720
[Applause]

551
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,570
mine is more of a comment you mentioned

552
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,570
about the UH sharing of information I

553
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,610
mean in this day and age especially if

554
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:06,070
you're a homeowner most of the

555
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:08,439
information about ownership is public

556
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:11,620
online and the government either go to

557
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,690
Facebook even if you have been posted

558
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,159
their date of birth

559
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,650
usually you figure out people's battle

560
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,510
it by all the happy battery messages

561
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:22,210
that just kind of like scroll scroll

562
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:23,440
down the page so there's so much of it

563
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,910
out there and we know how we can

564
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:49,510
actually control it I think the only

565
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:50,980
thing that sacredness I don't know try

566
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,280
to remove it as much as possible that's

567
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,280
really

568
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,510
like for example

569
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:16,500
so if you're if you're being stalked

570
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:19,410
online should you go to the local police

571
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:23,870
the FBI I'd help you out I mean half

572
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,870
tuck what's the best way to make it stop

573
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,730
are your friend in the Mafia

574
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:32,720
can you stop back

575
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,570
local police department actually has the

576
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:51,000
technology to be able to investigate it

577
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:53,100
and honestly probably don't think it's

578
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,139
going to happen until we start making

579
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,428
bomb threats or until they show up at

580
00:30:55,139 --> 00:30:58,289
your house with a gun then you can

581
00:30:56,429 --> 00:30:59,970
probably get a restraining order but

582
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,289
again we're sure new herds only go so

583
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,639
far so it's actually trying to attack

584
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:05,399
you you can throw the piece of paper

585
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:31,709
it's not a survivor it's actually

586
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:34,129
extremely routinely obviously myspace

587
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:37,110
was still active myspace Facebook

588
00:31:34,129 --> 00:31:38,459
LinkedIn and at the time the only the

589
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,870
course was not to have anything a

590
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,860
weekend so I had no professional

591
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:45,689
anything out there for a number of years

592
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:48,539
and when you kind of like go through

593
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:50,119
those things and my you know friends

594
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:55,179
family behind in comment

595
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:55,178
get set he finally got one

596
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,770
[Applause]
