1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,080
we're guys our next figure come up

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,759
Hudson Bush who's a security

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,780
architecture design he does index

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,340
falling at every little thing he does as

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,279
job he actually works with government

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,570
compliance business impact analysis and

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,910
risk management

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:55,110
today we teach about his mistakes so we

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:59,129
don't have people resume too small to

10
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,950
fail the reason that I started giving

11
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:05,309
talks the reason I started speaking at

12
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:08,820
conferences because I as I started

13
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,869
coming to conferences I realized that

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,939
every single person I talked to was

15
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,950
working at a small business they were

16
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,020
the only sysadmin they were on a small

17
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,450
team but almost every single talk that

18
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,499
was going to was and then our incident

19
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,149
response team of 15 people and I'm like

20
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:29,009
it makes sense because a lot of times

21
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:31,020
it's the more international conferences

22
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,420
things like that you the only people

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,770
that are not coming they're the only

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,400
people that it ended up having the

25
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,039
budget to speak or large company so

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,170
a little bit of ice so I'm an

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,650
interesting place where I work at MSP

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:49,010
and MSSP and I mostly work with small

29
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:52,490
and medium businesses that kinda makes

30
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,020
you part I guess because it isn't

31
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,699
something that happens most of the time

32
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,380
when I tell people that I work at small

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,150
meeting with small medium business and

34
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,750
security people either statewide or

35
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:08,060
power and that's essentially the whole

36
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:28,040
point of this talk I'm going to medium

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:31,820
businesses matters I'm gonna get on a

38
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,940
soapbox for a moment here this this

39
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,820
slide when I do not do any time at the

40
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:42,850
end I do as you saw as you see in the

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:48,700
bottom right there is a hashtag tweet

42
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:52,730
hashtag you can send me I don't care

43
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,839
do whatever but the reason I don't do

44
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,869
that it because a lot of times

45
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,510
especially people who look like me we're

46
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,680
kind of horrible so I don't know if

47
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,450
you've noticed this but what happens a

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,070
lot of time so I'm going to looks like

49
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:08,060
me you've been talking afterwards all

50
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:09,530
the questions a week so that was great

51
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,440
what do you think about high-level

52
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,930
security concept or good question or

53
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,709
something and then a lot of times people

54
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,450
who again don't what let me in various

55
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,980
different ways

56
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,839
we get a question or have you ever

57
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,619
considered business bored why didn't she

58
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,599
do that that is not a question that is a

59
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,930
I really wish that I had the confidence

60
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:35,200
to speak and I didn't so because of that

61
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:37,209
I noticed that too many times it kind of

62
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,149
in solidarity I've just realized that

63
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,739
Q&A is not inclusive or either speakers

64
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,770
or participants because the people who

65
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,480
usually ask the questions are generally

66
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,100
people know something inner little more

67
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,920
confident and they do want to speak

68
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,380
anyways so with that same way if you are

69
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,510
someone that's willing to shout out you

70
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,280
can yell at me if I say something that

71
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,750
you do not understand you that's the

72
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,989
question if you're a little more shy if

73
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,590
you're not seriously oh you'll help me

74
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,540
I'm fine

75
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:15,790
you know elaborate explain yourself you

76
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:19,149
know something so let me start off

77
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,349
saying so you know that you're in the

78
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,719
right talk do you know what I'm trying

79
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,840
to essentially and still here I talked

80
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,260
about this bit on the intro slide but if

81
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,599
you work with this small medium business

82
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,090
I know a lot of people use as I mean I

83
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,680
don't like that acronym because it's

84
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,679
subject matter expert and every come

85
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:44,469
so I use SME and I know it's an older

86
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:46,809
afternoon but I prefer so give you a

87
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:49,239
starting point and that's in a lot of

88
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:50,889
different ways that's if you are really

89
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:54,938
new to this industry gives you place it

90
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:56,799
to research if you don't know if you do

91
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:58,089
know security but you have no idea where

92
00:04:56,799 --> 00:05:01,779
to start

93
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:04,479
same and then give you tools to convince

94
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:06,009
management if you are not a speaker you

95
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,229
are not someone who wants to talk to

96
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:10,629
management for a half hour and why to do

97
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:13,360
security if you are a solstice admin

98
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:16,149
then you can just hand them a slide this

99
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,759
slide or this talk backing up for a

100
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,019
second you if I know that people are

101
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,979
gonna take pictures of slides that's

102
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:25,829
that's fine but also if if you want I

103
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,419
have the slides posted online the last

104
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:30,549
slide will give you the link to that and

105
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:33,219
everyone else you don't work in SMB

106
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:36,219
especially if you work at a vendor or an

107
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:41,019
MSP this is essentially saying small new

108
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:42,579
businesses are important and secure a

109
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:46,059
lot of people think it's just a fuse how

110
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:52,299
that's exercise I think that's obviously

111
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:54,249
wrong so here are my two this is just

112
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:57,248
telling you where I'm gonna split this

113
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:59,079
up into the first is why why RS and

114
00:05:57,249 --> 00:06:02,219
beans important than I'm going to do how

115
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,219
how do we secure them

116
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:13,369
first why there are twenty-eight point

117
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,219
eight million SMEs and small India

118
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,900
businesses in the US and this is

119
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,320
actually old statistics I think this was

120
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,049
2017 that represents fifty five percent

121
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,960
of all jobs in the US but then at the

122
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,840
same time 65% of all spear phishing

123
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,190
attempt attempts are aimed at SMB so you

124
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,210
just think that they're targeted and

125
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:39,050
then they're also important because

126
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:41,000
chances are one and every two people

127
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,190
that you know which means a good chance

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,290
people here are working in small and

129
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,969
medium businesses and you you do know

130
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,030
people who work at them I mean their

131
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:52,190
jobs are in danger when we're when

132
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,450
they're losing income when they're

133
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,930
getting breached when they're losing

134
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:59,539
data so and then this I mean it's an

135
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:03,470
it's an easy talking point target breach

136
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:08,210
was a result of a small 8-track vendor

137
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:10,550
be brief so supply chain attacks if

138
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,469
you're not carrying and you're seeing

139
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,830
more and more large companies are

140
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:19,010
carrying for example like Raytheon they

141
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:21,520
just bought force point there's no and

142
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:26,210
they're they're now targeting they're

143
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:29,450
actually Raytheon's working as a as an

144
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,820
MSP MSN MSSP for a lot of their

145
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,490
customers so in order it's really

146
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:38,419
interesting and a lot of their suppliers

147
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,060
so so then the question is why do we is

148
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,729
Miss Swami

149
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:46,270
when it comes to InfoSec and and I've

150
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:48,280
seen it I mean there's a lot of I I have

151
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,349
to even define small and medium business

152
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,729
because a lot of times talking at these

153
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:55,990
conferences people to find that is

154
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:58,360
anything under about 1500 employees 1500

155
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,970
is actually pretty large I'm talking I'm

156
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,160
generally talking from my experience and

157
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:06,370
medium businesses between about 50 and

158
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,260
200 but I know obviously a lot of these

159
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:15,070
applied to smaller and even much larger

160
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:17,440
but there's too many vendors there's

161
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:23,560
water but next gen ends of our companies

162
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:25,990
or or even EDR companies that will do

163
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:31,320
not even sell to you if you have less

164
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:33,400
than 150 employees that best student I

165
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,490
mean there's no other way to put it that

166
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,819
stupid than endangering companies is to

167
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,260
not even sell a lot of MSPs

168
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,330
know there are obviously small boutique

169
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,740
MSP that only work with small medium

170
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,940
businesses but then when you get with

171
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,680
larger ones they're like oh it's not

172
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:53,220
even worth my time so and that that's

173
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,130
part of again when I'm talking here so

174
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:00,820
the the question and actually I was in

175
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,740
the speakers lounge before this and one

176
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,990
of the other speakers said oh you work

177
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,760
with small meeting business is my least

178
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,890
favorite part I love working small

179
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,840
medium businesses now I'm talking the

180
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,970
very next slide about why I love working

181
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,770
with them but this is the plant or most

182
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:18,830
people hate they

183
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:22,579
I hate having to convince them to give

184
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:25,360
me budget and and I'm in a privileged

185
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,890
position that I work with mostly

186
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,510
manufacturing companies military

187
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:36,350
manufacturing tend to have a little more

188
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:38,660
money mostly military manufacturing so

189
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,310
there is compliance so just like with

190
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,410
eating I mean there there are two

191
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:46,459
reasons that anyone ever spends money on

192
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:49,069
security there is because the government

193
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,450
towards you and because you got breached

194
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,950
so essentially because the government

195
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,870
told you to order a customer closer to

196
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,100
more or less what it comes down to now I

197
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,590
was working on that an engagement

198
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,390
recently and I'm doing the scoping I'm

199
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,100
sitting down and I'm just confused and

200
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,960
after about 15 minutes talking online

201
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,550
I'm really confused so you never in

202
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,590
brief you know know combines these know

203
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,630
so we're we here keep like well because

204
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:18,080
I'm scared about security and I keep

205
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:19,790
them so you're smart you don't run into

206
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,800
that you don't run into people who just

207
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,569
want security for the sake of security

208
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,949
they want it because someone something

209
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,210
is forced their hands so that's

210
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,850
obviously going to be one of your

211
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,470
biggest the biggest motivators but I

212
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,180
think guarantee unique situation with

213
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,790
small and medium businesses because they

214
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,920
do not have that same resilience they do

215
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,780
not have that same resources like if we

216
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,670
lose 10 million dollars today it's no

217
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:46,300
big deal

218
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:48,709
he works at one of those companies but

219
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,510
the thing is a lot of times you're

220
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,310
talking to an owner or a manager or

221
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,780
someone with direct stake in this

222
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,790
company you can appeal to their pride

223
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,459
you can I can't tell you how many times

224
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,410
I've sat down with an owners and instead

225
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,600
of just saying hey let me pitch you this

226
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,850
you sit down and say so how to start

227
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,500
your business tell me your story then

228
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,710
they get this pride well up in them

229
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,780
telling the last 25 30 40 50 years about

230
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,470
how they have built this company from

231
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,810
scratch and all it takes is you saying

232
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,390
so how important is this to you

233
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,729
this is a major risk out here and you

234
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:26,170
don't want to lose what you have built

235
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:28,210
and you know I think I hate but a hint

236
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,160
care and certainty in doubt like I don't

237
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,630
like to just say you're going to be

238
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,089
breached and it's going to be terrible

239
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:37,860
you're going to lose millions of dollars

240
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,860
that is not the way to get anyone to

241
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:44,590
sure you you if you if you have to give

242
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,349
scary statistics I like to leave people

243
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,030
with hope you essentially say hey it's a

244
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,770
scary world out there they're terrible

245
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,770
people trying to do terrible things but

246
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:57,100
there's a way out and not even a salesy

247
00:11:53,770 --> 00:12:00,280
way but just if you leave on just but

248
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,440
you leave on just fear no no people

249
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,439
don't like to buy on fear you you talked

250
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,770
about about the hope you talked about

251
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,170
what you can how you can prevent against

252
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:13,750
it you always end with practical and

253
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,699
again I mean some of this because I am

254
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,320
an MSD sounds like I'm talking from

255
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,180
outside but if your internal it's that

256
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,510
same sales even if you're a sysadmin

257
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,650
trying to talk to a CEO or a president

258
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,480
of the company whatever

259
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:28,329
it's that same sales pitch you have to

260
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,950
say hey security matters this is why so

261
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,980
unfortunately you do have to be a bit of

262
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:35,290
a salesperson there now this last point

263
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,330
is is actually one of one of my

264
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,829
favorites this was introduced me I

265
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,839
forget the speaker's name but that

266
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:48,100
b-side San Francisco a couple years back

267
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:50,230
that InfoSec cybersecurity is not a

268
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,550
profit Center it's never really going to

269
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,220
be a profit Center doesn't make money

270
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,449
it's a cost center but one of the ways

271
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,010
to turn that on its head is introduce

272
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,290
security as a sales and marketing tact

273
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,510
and the easiest way to do that not the

274
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,579
cheapest but the ease

275
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,650
most efficient way to do that is getting

276
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,750
ISO certification now that obviously

277
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,060
cost money it may not be the first thing

278
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:15,030
you do but if you can pursue that put it

279
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,709
on your website beat the every single

280
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,870
conversation your silly will have with

281
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,430
the customer first thing you say one of

282
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,080
the first things you say before they ask

283
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,930
Katie what do you do about security you

284
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,610
say oh by the way here's our security

285
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,839
brochure you prepare that marketing

286
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,880
information you give them that

287
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,680
information before they ask because

288
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,280
generally the first time a company ever

289
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,630
talks about security is after a breach

290
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,839
that's the wrong time to talk about it

291
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:43,860
we want and I have actually seen this

292
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:45,840
tactic and obviously you don't need ISO

293
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,970
you don't need to spend that money but

294
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,500
if you do it gives that key finding and

295
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,440
I don't just believe in that

296
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,150
certification I just know that

297
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,610
especially with manufacturing so many of

298
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:59,010
our customers already have to be ISO

299
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,810
certified for QA it's an easy so they're

300
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:04,050
like oh one more ISO certification I can

301
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:07,890
get this and boom and it really does

302
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:09,660
work if you are a number and if you are

303
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:12,090
at want you can give those numbers and

304
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,199
start talking to sales and say hey how

305
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,330
many more sales do you think you've

306
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,460
gotten you know do a/b testing have a

307
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,620
couple sales people talk security have

308
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:23,910
them not do that it's it's interesting

309
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:26,940
and it really is it's a different

310
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,640
approach and I think after time you can

311
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,380
start talking about security not as a

312
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,910
cost center but as a profit Center where

313
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,640
you can start talking about security as

314
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:37,199
by the way this is how much money you

315
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,880
have saved but you could have been

316
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,950
breached you could have lost efficiency

317
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,020
you could have done this or that and

318
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:46,620
then also adding the sales tactic into

319
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,630
it so this is this is a bit of the how

320
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,730
you can convince people

321
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:57,260
biggest pain point working the small

322
00:14:50,730 --> 00:15:01,470
meeting businesses and then this is the

323
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:04,260
why why it's so fun why working with

324
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:07,320
larger businesses you have complicated

325
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,330
change of control you have so many

326
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,950
different approval processes but if

327
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,570
you're sitting with the president or the

328
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,620
CEO of a company and you asked him

329
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,290
something a lot of times they'll just

330
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,910
say here do it he can give you a broom

331
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,640
right then you start right then you

332
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:22,290
don't have to then go to purchasing and

333
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,750
acquisitions and everything you don't

334
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,329
have to do every single every single

335
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:31,050
piece you can just so so I love that

336
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:34,440
about these companies and it can be so

337
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:36,449
much easier because again I talked about

338
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,940
that already I guess the easier access

339
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,190
to decision-makers personal buy-in from

340
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,350
management it's not an abstract concept

341
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:46,440
what happens to this business if they

342
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,000
get breached the owner knows I mean they

343
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,800
know that risk it's keeping them up at

344
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,570
night what happens it's my business if I

345
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,189
go out of business in these 300 people

346
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,480
at least 200 people these thousand

347
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,430
people that I'm employing directly

348
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,130
cannot eat tomorrow that keeps them up

349
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:01,020
also easier experienced experimentation

350
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,610
and piloting I mean you have direct

351
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,560
access to users you don't have that

352
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,360
bureaucracy so you can you can push

353
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,300
something out to a subset of PCs and

354
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,730
it's it's much easier because again the

355
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,680
bureaucracy

356
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,970
now this last point I'm going to talk

357
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,989
about it as a positive here I'm going to

358
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,700
talk about it as a negative

359
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,260
later you get smaller environment

360
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,810
increases the ability to know where

361
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:25,530
everything is what it does I mean the

362
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:27,150
first thing we do when securing is we we

363
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,510
have to know what we're securing we have

364
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,199
to do and we have to do an asset

365
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,640
assessment

366
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,160
it's a lot easier to do that when you

367
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,439
have three rooms four rooms even this

368
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,969
200 you can almost walk around an

369
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,649
inventory of the manual you don't want

370
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,720
to but you can confirm you can look in

371
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:46,810
every room and say wait I just counted

372
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,190
203 pcs but I'm gonna see 202 Omni and

373
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:52,029
Active Directory are in the asset

374
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:53,440
inventory so and with that it's also you

375
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:55,060
can know when someone asks you a

376
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,040
question you can pull that up in your

377
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,510
mind and instead of just having a look

378
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,599
at some sheet because obviously you

379
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:04,059
don't know everything about 1,500 pcs or

380
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,730
2,000 pcs or 32 servers but if you have

381
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:07,149
8 servers and 300 people you can know

382
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,730
them

383
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,829
so that again talking about it was

384
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,209
positive I'm going to shift that in a

385
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:17,290
second because it does have a negative

386
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:19,860
side obviously so then how obviously

387
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:23,709
like to make things practical there is

388
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:26,349
there are different approaches obviously

389
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,600
because you can't just say oh this

390
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:31,449
worked really well at this large

391
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,830
business let me apply this I we were

392
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,830
working with a relatively small

393
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:40,720
relatively small manufacturing company

394
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:44,110
about 250 people and they brought in

395
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:48,669
this guy who had previously been a C so

396
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:50,979
at a huge company hundred thousand

397
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:53,169
people huge company and he he started

398
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:56,590
moving to consulting and he just kept

399
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:58,450
saying oh did he just do this it's easy

400
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:01,030
just do this just just implement the

401
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:03,040
firewall rules I'm like sure that might

402
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,960
be easy if your networking team is

403
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,149
thirty people which he mentioned that

404
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,180
his networking team

405
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,040
was around 30 people if you can you

406
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,810
already know the environment that will

407
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,780
help but it's a lot harder when you have

408
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,220
one guy on site one sysadmin who's

409
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,930
already overworked who's also the

410
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,790
database admin and everything else and

411
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,680
you're like telling him to just

412
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:25,320
implement these firewall rules and I'm

413
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,870
laughing at him like you know how much

414
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,060
testing is it sure if you have 30 people

415
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:34,919
you know in one hour they can spend 30

416
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:36,810
man hours I mean it but but it's you do

417
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:46,020
obviously have to think about things a

418
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:49,740
little bit so in in my bio I in my Bible

419
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:53,040
that you mentioned that I threat model

420
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,680
everything and I risk assess everything

421
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,360
I am NOT a typical quant I am not

422
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:01,050
someone who just sees numbers for

423
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,060
everything but this is someone who

424
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,919
terrible is an industry can he do not

425
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,129
fret why well we do not want to do risk

426
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,310
management assessment because we want to

427
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:13,380
do what's fun with shiny what's cool so

428
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:15,840
but that is risk assessment and threat

429
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,340
modeling is even more important with

430
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,129
small and medium businesses because the

431
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,750
thing is you don't have all of these

432
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,340
resources to throw at things if you only

433
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,950
have limited resources you have to say

434
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,689
what actually is going to happen to me

435
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,880
what is most likely to happen to me and

436
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,340
how do I prioritize and secure against

437
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,440
that first what is it that the business

438
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:37,949
has that they do not want to lose our

439
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,200
chemicals do that first don't just come

440
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,450
in and take well I heard about meltdown

441
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,520
inspector so I'm gonna spend all my time

442
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,230
we are protecting against that you know

443
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,730
that may not be the right way to do it

444
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:53,600
um understand the types of attacks and

445
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:56,070
the threats to expect and then do not

446
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:06,899
attempt to secure the same way a large

447
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:09,360
enterprise would okay and this this

448
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,290
applies no matter what size business you

449
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,149
are working with this is not this is a

450
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:18,840
really simplified definition of threat

451
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:20,790
modeling but no of what you're

452
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,409
protecting and to know what you're

453
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:30,870
protecting against you you can't just

454
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:32,760
you're not gonna secure you're not gonna

455
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,370
scare two items the same you're not

456
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,920
gonna secure you know a little kick

457
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,479
scooter and a Tesla the same you're not

458
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,760
gonna secure these things differently

459
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,380
you're you're gonna have to secure them

460
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,750
differently so you have to think you

461
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,220
have to know where your data is you have

462
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,020
to run through data classification you

463
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,420
have to find where your crown jewels are

464
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:54,000
and you have to also know as a small

465
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,620
business what most likely are my attacks

466
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,120
now obviously if you're working in a

467
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,399
huge company if you're working in at

468
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,939
Google you do need to protect against

469
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,430
just about everything but different but

470
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,350
here I most of us should know the

471
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:11,400
defenders do I'm gonna wear blue teamers

472
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:13,679
an attacker only needs to exploit one

473
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,510
weakness but a defender needs to protect

474
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:19,740
against all weaknesses I think that's

475
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:22,410
wrong I I think that is wrong it's

476
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,540
misleading and it's scary because the

477
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:27,240
thing is especially at a small medium

478
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:29,250
business it just bet an attacker is

479
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,990
never gonna use all weaknesses they're

480
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,630
going to get to a certain point

481
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,309
they're gonna give up because even

482
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,690
trying to attack anyways I don't even

483
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:39,629
know what this company does they're

484
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:42,000
gonna give up so and I say it's my

485
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,880
definition of attackers dilemma it is a

486
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,260
bit different but the reality is that we

487
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,300
not enough people are talking about the

488
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:51,000
attackers women I think this is what how

489
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,950
we need to reframe it a defender only

490
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,900
needs to make it too expensive for an

491
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,790
attacker to exploit a target given the

492
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,100
value of that target I'm going to repeat

493
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:01,050
it and then I'm going to explain it the

494
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,750
defender needs to make it too expensive

495
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:05,850
for an attacker to exploit a target

496
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:09,120
given the value of that target so

497
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:11,689
instead of the typical definition of the

498
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,489
defenders dilemma is you're on a boat

499
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,960
with a thousand holes and you're one

500
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:21,270
person and you need to plug all those

501
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:22,890
holes and in here is this picture of

502
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,510
someone frantically around trying to

503
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:27,360
plug all these holes with only ten

504
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:30,200
fingers and ten toes and that obviously

505
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,610
never going to work but the reality is

506
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:36,330
there there are two things that

507
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:41,629
typically are going to happen there -

508
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:44,590
small and medium businesses fishing

509
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,580
I mean really the non targeted attacks

510
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:52,209
opportunistic attacks as I like to call

511
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:56,780
them because more automated things so I

512
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:59,600
we had a st. st. same guy who kept

513
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:03,010
saying oh it's so easy just you know

514
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,689
just change these firewall rules was

515
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:07,730
when he came in the very first thing

516
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:11,690
that he just kept saying we needed to do

517
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:13,429
was hard driving prick no not a bad

518
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,690
thing to do great thing to do actually

519
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:16,309
but he just kept saying just push our

520
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,880
Drive Encryption now just push BitLocker

521
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:21,020
up just push it out and I'm like and

522
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,789
he's like why don't we just do that it's

523
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:28,370
do that first in the wing now thinking

524
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:30,530
of threat modeling for a second what are

525
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,989
you trying to get and what do you have

526
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:34,668
to do for hard drive encryption to even

527
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:38,510
matter one that means you're trying to

528
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:40,880
get a hard drive it's not it in transit

529
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:42,110
where you're trying to catch things on

530
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,789
the network you're trying to get a hard

531
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,850
drive so how would you get a hard drive

532
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:49,908
well you have to be in the building and

533
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:51,168
then you have to actually remove okay in

534
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:52,880
most of our environments there's not a

535
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:55,640
lot of salespeople so aside from three

536
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,870
laptops sure you can push lab you can

537
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,690
push a bit longer than three laptops

538
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,309
pretty easily but or you can send them

539
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,650
new laptops if there were remote

540
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:05,960
salespeople but let's say you have 200

541
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,820
pcs just pushing BitLocker what are you

542
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:12,169
actually getting out of that

543
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:13,428
why not you know maybe secure your

544
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:14,960
you're building a little bit and

545
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:16,490
honestly this is the only place I've

546
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,659
ever not been able to tell me my way

547
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,570
into I've never been able to fall

548
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:22,520
someone into someone finally one day he

549
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,580
said it again in a meeting he said it

550
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,020
with the CEO and he just said we I don't

551
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:30,889
know I bet buggers and pushed everywhere

552
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:33,080
and I just in a fit of rage do not do

553
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,510
this do not be me but I just stood up

554
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,990
and I'm like okay so you you you must

555
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:40,110
think that the physical security

556
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:41,220
this building is so bad that someone's

557
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,659
gonna steal hard drive let's get the

558
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,760
facilities in here right now let's get

559
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,820
them in here let's let them address your

560
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,550
your concerns or how about let's do this

561
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:53,700
if you're so concerned about hard drives

562
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:56,580
being stolen which that must be what

563
00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:00,840
you're concerned about here let's start

564
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,889
blocking the seminary door but but

565
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,020
here's what's worse

566
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,700
so in this you have to get in this

567
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,900
building you have to go into the idea

568
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,970
office and then into the server room

569
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,130
door and neither of those doors are ever

570
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,140
longer closed the reason that the server

571
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:17,130
in door is not locked or closed is

572
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:20,940
because the thermostat is on the IP side

573
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:24,420
of it see instead of having a portable

574
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,760
you know a secondary thermostat in there

575
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,950
having a secondary air conditioning no

576
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,390
don't they don't even close or lock it

577
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:35,720
and then there's what the exits door is

578
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:38,340
not closed and this this thing is that

579
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:51,570
so that the trash could be taken out at

580
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:53,220
night and in but that's the thing so

581
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:55,470
often we hear something and I used to

582
00:25:53,220 --> 00:26:01,950
know them as an inspectors examples

583
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:05,640
because the thing is for someone to use

584
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,840
speculative execution threats against

585
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,510
you means that they have tried

586
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,610
everything but also to patch against

587
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,650
those things a lot of times you have to

588
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,090
reduce your no it's not a bad thing to

589
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,290
pass I think you should patch all the

590
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:19,590
things I'm going to talk about that

591
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:21,270
again in a second but that's not what

592
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:26,280
you should rush to be doing if you're

593
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:29,670
not if you're if you're still exposing

594
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,620
port 3389 to the Internet but you're so

595
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,820
concerned about spectre and meltdown and

596
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,520
you're spending all this time on

597
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,110
emergency

598
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,530
in Windows maybe spend it on the

599
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:42,129
emergency poor closing windows and that

600
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,750
that's my whole point here is that you

601
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,220
should be estimating what happens to the

602
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,290
business if something happens and the

603
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,700
likelihood of that happening and I know

604
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,970
that obviously we don't have all the

605
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,560
data but you do know as especially small

606
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,230
and medium businesses but really any

607
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,060
business that is the first thing if you

608
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,590
if you aren't confident that you can

609
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,080
protect against phishing and ransomware

610
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:04,540
we don't even deserve to be talking

611
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,230
about the other things yet I gave a talk

612
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:10,889
on that in in Vancouver a couple months

613
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:13,450
ago where essentially my whole topic was

614
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:15,310
clean as an industry don't even deserves

615
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,750
a lot of these nice fancy comments is

616
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,909
where we're sitting talking about things

617
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,580
like MFA bypass when no one would ever

618
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:24,610
need to use that when you're going to

619
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,740
win when most of your users will still

620
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,600
click yes this was me I was listening to

621
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,250
a pen tester who says I'm the worst pen

622
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,159
tester in the world most of what I do is

623
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:34,990
I'll just request the MFA key and nine

624
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,280
times out of ten your user will say yeah

625
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,100
this is me and then I'll get into their

626
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,470
club their their Club dashboard it's not

627
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,540
even just users if he's like I've never

628
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:47,680
had to use any of those MFA bypass tools

629
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:48,879
that people are talking about so let's

630
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,830
start protect against some of those

631
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,320
things and since we until we get all

632
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:57,280
excited about the shiny things and shiny

633
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:59,350
things I mean it's fun to talk about all

634
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,120
of these threats but when it comes down

635
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,600
to it you mean to actually protect your

636
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,969
environment and not just protect against

637
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,590
imaginary things so that comes down into

638
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:13,269
harmony and this is again kind of my own

639
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:17,120
somewhat funny take

640
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:20,179
on the tick typical definitions of

641
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,479
pardoning so pardoning and comes down to

642
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:25,490
a few three major things um

643
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:29,059
principle of least privilege which as I

644
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:30,740
defined it is an account shouldn't be

645
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:35,720
able to access anything that that

646
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:37,610
account shouldn't have access to yeah

647
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,809
make sense I mean obviously you can

648
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:46,879
choose that out of thousand different

649
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:48,619
ways but essentially if if I do a lot of

650
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:50,389
mergers and acquisitions and we came

651
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:53,990
into a company they've bought another

652
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:55,519
company and they I don't know how

653
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:59,990
familiar was all of you or with that

654
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:02,029
dress but there is in but the domain

655
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,340
users group was in the administrators

656
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:07,369
group the domain not domain

657
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,928
administrators to the built-in which is

658
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:11,809
which is bad that means essentially

659
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:13,519
every single account can do everything

660
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:16,809
that they need to do for the most part

661
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:20,269
and the whole reason for that was that

662
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:22,549
use it users needed to be able to remote

663
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:25,429
to multiple different laptop multiple

664
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:27,049
different pcs from home I mean there's a

665
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:29,629
whole group for that for a mode access

666
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:32,809
there's a little group for it but it was

667
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:34,610
I mean so so that's that's principle

668
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:35,779
these privileged batch that obviously

669
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,479
most of us know that shouldn't happen

670
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:39,769
but it does come down to limit your

671
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,509
access as much as you can to the

672
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:43,850
principle at least functionality similar

673
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:46,100
definition a machine shouldn't be able

674
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:51,350
to do anything that that machine

675
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:52,969
shouldn't be able to do so that's you

676
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:56,570
know you don't really need candy crush

677
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:58,759
on that laptop do you I hate them I love

678
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:02,090
that in Windows in Server 2019 they

679
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:03,860
removed it but in Server 2016 Windows

680
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,449
Live authentication was a default

681
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,008
service now it was never enabled but

682
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,910
it's still just every time I looked in

683
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:10,740
the

684
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:13,620
looking in there me why do I have a

685
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,990
window no not windows like an Xbox Live

686
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:20,550
sorry Xbox Live Authenticator on my

687
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:24,600
server if anyone ever used that love I

688
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:27,120
would love to hear why but in a real

689
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,100
production and then the again I'm

690
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,139
simplifying everything but encrypt all

691
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,199
the things pass all the things I made a

692
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:37,710
joke about archive encryption but at the

693
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:40,110
same time it is that I mean encrypt what

694
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,600
you can especially in transit I mean

695
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,100
please be removing your XP machines and

696
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,800
your Windows 7 machines you can't

697
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:52,350
encrypt SMB traffic if you still have

698
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:55,320
Windows 7 so and then patch all the

699
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:57,659
things I mean this whole slide could be

700
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:02,310
two or three different talks so I'm

701
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:05,820
going through it quick um open source

702
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:07,980
everything know how well you can see

703
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:11,340
that red but please don't now I'm a huge

704
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:14,520
open source man if you're more

705
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:17,610
interested in what I what I have to say

706
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:20,400
about open source at the end of when I

707
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,290
give my slides there there is a talk

708
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,680
that I gave yesterday actually in

709
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:27,990
Knoxville called building starting from

710
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,970
scratch building security program in 365

711
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,820
days and I talked a lot about every

712
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:37,770
single open source tool I use I use a

713
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:41,760
lot but that may be nice to use all open

714
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:46,080
source in a large in a large environment

715
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,780
but as we all know open source does cost

716
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,659
less but it costs more in human

717
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:53,820
resources it costs more in technical

718
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,260
resources you need to know warrant you

719
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,389
don't have time to know more don't just

720
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,419
say oh I'm gonna build this from some

721
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:00,820
open source of me

722
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:02,259
consider actually paying for it the

723
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:04,090
larger the company gets the more

724
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:05,889
resources you have the more I say yeah

725
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:10,869
trying to use open source there's a ton

726
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:15,189
of benefits for it if anyone here works

727
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:20,559
at spunk I'm sorry you may not believe I

728
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:22,869
want that million dollar sim even if you

729
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,908
can't afford it you probably don't need

730
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:26,980
it there are a lot of great tools out

731
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:29,070
there again I don't make a lot of

732
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:32,970
friends as one when I'm talking because

733
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:35,918
I like to cost once the coffee breaks in

734
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:38,080
that essentially you do a search you go

735
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,629
get coffee and come back you realize you

736
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,309
searched you you you come back you

737
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:44,889
realize your search is just finished but

738
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:47,440
you probably wrote your quarry wrong

739
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:49,269
then you go in take a second coffee

740
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:54,549
break and thirty minutes later you might

741
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:56,409
have suddenly you have to consider

742
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:58,090
carefully what resources and scenarios

743
00:32:56,409 --> 00:33:00,009
need to be monitored especially if you

744
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,470
are using someone fun I'm against punk

745
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:05,950
is a great product it is it's just I

746
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:09,999
think it is a syllabus it's just not

747
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:11,649
always but can consider what resources

748
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:14,259
and scenarios need to be modern now the

749
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:16,840
benefit and in a small environment is

750
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:19,359
that you can potentially monitor

751
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,759
everything because there's less there's

752
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:25,269
less things to monitor but at the same

753
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:27,249
time you may only be able to monitor a

754
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:31,779
few things and my favorite choice you

755
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:32,600
can only monitor one thing DNS logs and

756
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:35,120
you can all

757
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,939
or one thing get your annex left monitor

758
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,949
room

759
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:43,910
Marc baguette has some really cool tools

760
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:45,380
for enriching DNS logs I probably should

761
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,690
have put those on the resource slides at

762
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:51,320
the end but really cool tools where you

763
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:53,870
can see how randomized if it looks like

764
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:57,050
DGA if it looks like a random non legit

765
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:58,489
website and Laura how young because

766
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:01,879
we've done this in our internal network

767
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:04,040
where essentially we block any woops any

768
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:10,250
domain that was registered in the last

769
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:11,750
30 days not had a single I know if

770
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,070
you're a dev off shop it's gonna be

771
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,480
different you are gonna be registering

772
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,830
domains if you're dealing with web

773
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,449
admins it's gonna be a little different

774
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:21,889
you might have several policies for that

775
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:24,319
but it's something like 90% of all

776
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:27,310
phishing attempts are made by domains

777
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,230
that were registered in last 24 hours so

778
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:32,840
so getting your DNS logs and reaching

779
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:38,449
them right that is extremely important

780
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:41,390
and then I haven't talked about it too

781
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:43,189
much because again I don't want to I

782
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:46,819
don't want to seem too biased but there

783
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:49,700
is a reason to consider an MSP and MSSP

784
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:52,640
if you're a small business it's not

785
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:54,409
always the right tool but I mean if you

786
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,480
don't want to have to learn wsus and

787
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:58,460
start patching all of your servers

788
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,990
they'll have great tools Robyn are

789
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:03,140
amending tool to patch your servers on

790
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:07,790
em SSDs can be a benefit I know again

791
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:11,779
it's generally a dirty word but doesn't

792
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:16,049
have to be you need a consultant

793
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:18,240
especially I'm a huge fan of lutein ms

794
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:22,650
bees the smaller ones that can actually

795
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,419
devote time you that is ideal so a

796
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:27,210
transition plan this is what I like to

797
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:32,849
call outgoing that cyberthreats on

798
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:35,730
insider threat because the reality is if

799
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:37,740
like I said what I said one of the

800
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:40,740
benefits of small medium businesses that

801
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:42,779
one person can know everything them the

802
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,879
negative is that one person knows

803
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:47,250
everything when they leave they know

804
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,839
everything so you have to protect their

805
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,700
knowledge a little more you have to lock

806
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:52,890
them even more you have to consider this

807
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:57,598
in advance because you may not even know

808
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:59,069
what people use there was an MSSP that I

809
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,470
was talking to the other day that they

810
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:03,808
actually built their own password tool

811
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:06,390
internally that every time a password

812
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:08,099
was accessed as long and now other all

813
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,569
of their staff can access almost every

814
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,819
password I didn't love that but what it

815
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:14,460
did is it showed what passwords they've

816
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:16,529
accessed and that is actually great you

817
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,619
want something to show you want to log

818
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:22,349
what keys what certificates what what

819
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:24,089
who has what because you you need to

820
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:28,559
have a transition plan you need to have

821
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:30,509
a password change plan this is also a

822
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,029
fairly easy one ensure that there is a

823
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:35,069
CFA a warning in your exit interview or

824
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:38,670
termination process that is a good way

825
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:40,890
to scare the crap out of someone by the

826
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,270
way miss use any of this computer

827
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:45,710
information that you have when you try

828
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:50,930
and access our network remotely later

829
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:53,540
we'll go to jail so um talk to legal

830
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,960
about that get that in yeah get that in

831
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,650
writing

832
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:59,450
um I I just seen the look on people's

833
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,340
faces when they have this kind of smug

834
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:10,160
oh I'm gonna get you and at the moment

835
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:12,710
that you talk about CFA backup data

836
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,660
check your backup test your backup alert

837
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:18,790
on your backup check your alerts and

838
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,790
resolve your alerts backups are not fun

839
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,640
fun but if you've never tested your

840
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:29,180
backup you don't want to do it after a

841
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,310
ransomware attack test it honestly with

842
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,460
the new book ransomware that's out there

843
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:37,880
that will be us that will encrypt your

844
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:41,270
archives backups it'll go in it'll live

845
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:44,570
this I believe in Sam Sann reuse all all

846
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:46,430
that fan family will essentially sit in

847
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,590
your network and it will encrypt your

848
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:51,500
backups as they're happening in weeks

849
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:54,110
before you even know so I'm starting to

850
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:58,390
try and it's often as possible every

851
00:37:54,110 --> 00:38:01,910
single day I try to restore one better

852
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:05,839
okay I'm gonna wrap up really really

853
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:08,660
quick easy slide SMEs are important

854
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:10,580
they're targeted they're similar you

855
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,529
need to back up and then resource of

856
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,299
risk assessment are even more important

857
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:20,300
in small businesses than enterprise

858
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:22,010
