1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,620
this is Jason Hill we'll be going over

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,679
how do you create and compliance in a

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,629
baseline for this show up today as I

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,000
take time to thank our sponsors these

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:19,119
are the State Department information

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,070
systems the unity and poor security of

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:28,750
health systems without this we don't

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:31,330
have these sides so review now I'll go

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,300
ahead and pologize because I found out

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,860
this morning that I have structure and

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,180
that's exactly the sickness you want to

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,180
have when you're doing presentations

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:46,390
take a break so like I said that my name

14
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:48,070
is Jason Hill I as it says up on this

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,800
screen right here the director of

16
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:56,469
strategic services for cyber entity'

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:01:01,120
we're in MSSP doing things like manage

18
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:05,549
soon we have I managed the teams that do

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:09,570
the assessments the audits the

20
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:13,270
penetration testing things like and so

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,309
just to give you an idea of why I am

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:19,298
talking about this why we kind of came

23
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:22,600
up with making this a service and yes we

24
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:24,700
are going to be talking about our secret

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,399
sauce it's not really secret sauce it

26
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,570
just seems that way to people that don't

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,570
really have

28
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:38,460
the capacity or the team to do this it

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,390
seems like secret sauce but really it's

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:47,880
stuff that's public well for Kobe but

31
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:50,179
what what I've seen when I've gone and

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,759
done audits I was a PC IQ to say as well

33
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:55,950
and we're not going to an audit

34
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,890
I hear pretty much the same thing over

35
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,409
and over which is man we just got

36
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,210
complete ready for you to show up and

37
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,459
we're good to go on PC I we think this

38
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,380
year and you know as soon as you're out

39
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,600
of here in a switch gears we're really

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:14,670
going to go on fill in one of the

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:18,540
alphabet soups if she'll be a mess

42
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,488
whatever it happens right and so nine

43
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,780
times out of ten never I do an

44
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,180
assessment we're never done an audit

45
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:31,500
what happens is it's going from one

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:34,080
firefighting to another and so what we

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,120
discovered over time is that the current

48
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,450
process is broken how most people

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,070
address their compliance where their

50
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,619
regulation whatever it happens to be

51
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,140
most of the time it is let's look at the

52
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,680
controls let's apply the control before

53
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,708
the audit

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,709
rush rush rush get it done oh we're done

55
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:57,290
okay we don't do this again to make sure

56
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:57,290
and then next year we'll talk about that

57
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:09,060
something that is coming to a head is

58
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,720
that we have more and more and more

59
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:16,060
compliances that are

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,750
right so we have glba that hit a few

61
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,220
years ago

62
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:23,800
Jean ERP and that hit a few years ago in

63
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,200
801 71 is now required for anybody who

64
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,200
has any government data that includes

65
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,380
schools because student loans

66
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,660
technically a government date so all of

67
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,940
these compliances are coming on the road

68
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,609
there's more and more that you have to

69
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,950
address so that means more and more cars

70
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,400
it was more and more rushing from one to

71
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,899
the other and so I've seen this in large

72
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,870
companies and I've seen this in small

73
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,700
countries not all so some of you in here

74
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,580
are going to be sitting through this and

75
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,399
going wow yeah that's what we do great

76
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:01,750
you are a very small minority okay a

77
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:05,680
very small minority and so for the rest

78
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:11,470
of you we have to worry about especially

79
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,480
multiple this is something that we have

80
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,640
successfully deployed at several

81
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,959
customers and it's changed the way they

82
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:22,810
do business but again it's not really

83
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,550
anything that's that's secret and when

84
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,800
you see this you'll say wow that's

85
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,960
completely hidden nobody knew this yeah

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,010
it's out there just you have to know the

87
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,190
process and so this is all they're going

88
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,610
to be talking about here now you know

89
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,870
let's be honest compliance is not

90
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,720
something that is sexy right

91
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,880
so when you go to a partner when you go

92
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,690
to one of these events like this and you

93
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,219
say I'm in compliant you get the glaze

94
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,960
if somebody immediately starts thinking

95
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,149
that's wonderful how do I get out of

96
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,938
this

97
00:04:54,149 --> 00:05:00,249
when you say I'm a penetration tester

98
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:02,409
you either get that's awesome I want to

99
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:04,089
talk to you online or what is that

100
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:05,889
well I'm essentially a hacker and

101
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:06,520
there's people lined up but let's be

102
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,649
honest

103
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,159
us getting hacker you ask any

104
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:13,839
penetration tester of worth their salt

105
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:18,729
what do you need to do in order to be

106
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:21,249
secure and one they should tell you well

107
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:24,188
you'll never be truly secure the only

108
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:26,770
way you can be secure is to destroy the

109
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:29,169
data so that's the first thing the

110
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,659
second thing is they'll say the boring

111
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,419
stuff all right so that's the other

112
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:36,520
thing about this talk is they'll say you

113
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:42,039
know like one of our top guys that we

114
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:45,479
use they say look patch run for ability

115
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:47,740
scans everything to make sure that you

116
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,449
have complex passwords

117
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,520
that's all boring stuff it's all

118
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:55,240
compliance related people that's really

119
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:59,498
what makes me more secure so let's talk

120
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:03,419
about what most people do when it comes

121
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:03,419
to their

122
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:17,830
okay so what most people do this is I've

123
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:21,189
seen it time and time again completely

124
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:25,539
ignore the problem oh we've got blank

125
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:28,779
compliance out you know back a few years

126
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:33,460
ago it was well we've got to be myst

127
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:36,639
compliant or by December 31st 2018 well

128
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:41,020
that's like 18 months away okay so you

129
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:44,620
ignore me then a month away two months

130
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,438
away three months away you can't can you

131
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,300
say oh this is coming a lot sooner than

132
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,520
I thought was all these controls all

133
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,740
this documentation I need to do all of

134
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,628
this stuff that needs to happen in order

135
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,870
for us to meet these compliance is in

136
00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:01,629
order to meet this checklist and that's

137
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,129
what you do run around doing whatever

138
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,740
you can everybody stops everything

139
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:08,169
projects are halted to get ready for the

140
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,379
autumn or at least get ready for that

141
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:13,870
stage now let's be honest a lot of times

142
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:15,550
infinite occurs not showing up it's well

143
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,449
we should probably do that it is a law

144
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,809
but we'll get to it right that happens a

145
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:21,809
lot too

146
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:30,400
next you go into the process you look at

147
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,318
what your current state is look at the

148
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,698
requirements you start to make a list of

149
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,759
here's all the things we've got to do

150
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:38,319
you put in your budget all sorts of

151
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,210
things that you want to purchase and you

152
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,530
say it's required for the compliance

153
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:46,750
because otherwise they wouldn't let you

154
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:48,539
buy it and so you go down the list what

155
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,460
are we going to do what do we got to do

156
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,409
and then we apply it and that is

157
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,900
normally a fee Verte brush we're cut

158
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:58,569
where users are upset because you're

159
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,128
making changes so fast that you've got

160
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:01,719
to make this documentation maybe you

161
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:04,090
have to bring in a third party to get

162
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:08,590
everything ready it's it's a fevered

163
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:11,020
pitch then we put in all our security

164
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,580
controls update our policies and

165
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,789
procedures to match the security

166
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,830
controls and often times we put in our

167
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:20,050
policies and procedures the ideal world

168
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,448
and then there's actually the real world

169
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:26,590
that's separate from the ideal world and

170
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:29,560
we run around again and so we mediate we

171
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:32,500
put all these changes into place and we

172
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,929
then have the auditor show up the

173
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,429
sacrifice' go to the audit gods because

174
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,289
who knows whether or not we're actually

175
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,419
going to be compliant because we've been

176
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:42,848
brushing around like Complete Idiot's

177
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:48,819
this last few months because we're not

178
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:54,459
ready then you undergo the other and you

179
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:58,660
say sweat and worry then we hope this is

180
00:08:54,459 --> 00:09:01,268
not a resume in generating event and

181
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,490
then you repeat Wow that's over boo okay

182
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:07,190
I need a vacation to go off I'm gonna

183
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:09,730
drink lots of all the beverages and

184
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:13,069
and we'll wait until next year again and

185
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:15,800
that's how most companies deal with

186
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:18,139
regularly dealing with compliance deal

187
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,229
with regulations I've seen it time and

188
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:25,220
time and time again I've gone into

189
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:27,379
environments where they were being fined

190
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,939
fifteen twenty thirty thousand dollars a

191
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:31,279
month because they were not PCI

192
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:32,629
compliant because they did this and

193
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:39,620
thought well two months is plenty enough

194
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:43,730
time to get PCI compliant into your

195
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:46,819
business into your March but wait

196
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,699
there's more problems and that is the

197
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:51,800
Russian Roulette of our the regulation

198
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:56,000
roulette is what I like of all these

199
00:09:51,800 --> 00:10:01,660
different just give you an idea at the

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,550
state level federal not local not

201
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:07,160
international just the state level

202
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,979
there's currently two hundred and sixty

203
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,100
five bills and resolutions that

204
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:18,230
addressed compliance at just the state

205
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:21,410
level there's really becoming this point

206
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,569
where unless you have a plan unless you

207
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,019
have a mechanism from eating these

208
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:30,469
compliances you're not going to be just

209
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,420
not or you've got a keep hiring more and

210
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,279
more people to run around in a panic

211
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:40,310
that's not really the right way to do

212
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:42,769
anything not only that but we're having

213
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:45,319
more breaches I don't know about you all

214
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:46,850
but in in our business we've seen kind

215
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:49,759
of an inflection point that happened

216
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:52,339
about a year to two years ago where

217
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,290
before that kind of a watershed before

218
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:57,139
that we'd go talk to a company and they

219
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:59,269
would say well compliance is just to

220
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:00,649
drain on my income it just cuts into

221
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:02,300
margin it doesn't really

222
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:05,509
me anything it's kind of like insurance

223
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:08,449
I do not really all that interested in

224
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:11,920
it's not really something that I want to

225
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:16,219
do it's not really forced to do it and

226
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,769
then we've had breach

227
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,720
after breach after breach you all know

228
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:23,240
who all the breaches you know target

229
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,480
Equifax although all of that and most of

230
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:31,879
those guess what because they didn't do

231
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:35,720
the basic stuff come on that's not that

232
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:37,220
hard yeah I was a system guy so I know

233
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,569
that on the other side of the fence I'm

234
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,279
going to be telling you as the

235
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,349
compliance people I'm not touching my

236
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:43,939
system it's okay I'm not touching it if

237
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,290
they don't fall over and everything will

238
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:50,540
be back right but you got it and so

239
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,829
because of this because of these things

240
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:56,209
that are happening we have more and more

241
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:59,989
in the situations that lead us to have

242
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:01,689
to be compliant not only that but I

243
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,749
don't know if you've noticed each

244
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:06,920
regulation each compliance framework

245
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:11,179
believes that they are the only one that

246
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:13,878
exists in the universe and who cares if

247
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:15,439
you're compliant with 17 other ones we

248
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,990
want to know you you're watching your

249
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:22,149
logs we want to know that you're you

250
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:26,269
have passwords for your users we're

251
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:28,160
we're complying with all the 800-53

252
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:29,689
controls every single one of them I'm

253
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,600
not gonna believe that you're watching

254
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:34,839
your boss okay so then you gotta show it

255
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,639
every single time and so there's this

256
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,870
mishmash of all these different

257
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:41,300
compliances that we have to comply with

258
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,790
now if you only have one or if you have

259
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,128
none to comply with good for you that's

260
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,829
not going to last you're going to have

261
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:50,779
to address this anyway so what we did

262
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:53,059
was we basically said there's got to be

263
00:12:50,779 --> 00:13:00,290
a better way of course there is I've

264
00:12:53,059 --> 00:13:01,209
done nine figure security implementation

265
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,699
for the Air Force

266
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:05,369
whereas this

267
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,280
and you learn quick that there is

268
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,020
processes for everything you want to go

269
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,000
to the bathroom that is a process and

270
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,000
there's a regulation that is a form that

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,200
you have to allow and while a lot of

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,940
that is quite a bit tedious out what the

273
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:27,120
intent is is to make sure that you don't

274
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:31,830
miss any of this that's what we're going

275
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,360
to talk about so we have a framework now

276
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,860
what a framework is if you're not

277
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,920
familiar what you should be but if

278
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:42,630
you're not it is it's basically a way

279
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,939
that you can go and step by step make

280
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:50,240
sure that you are doing all the things

281
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:53,820
necessary to try to make sure your

282
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,290
environment security now now notice what

283
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,510
I said try to make your barn secure

284
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,060
because as we all know compliance

285
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,220
doesn't mean your security being secure

286
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,000
doesn't mean your comply there's two

287
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,400
different things

288
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
now being compliant helps you get secure

289
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:12,959
helps you down the road it does and

290
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,340
again you know if you have a vendor if

291
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,050
you have anybody come in and say this

292
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,720
product this service makes you secure

293
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,540
back away slowly get out bear spray and

294
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,700
run away because nothing makes you

295
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,599
secure if if a state actor wants your

296
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,970
data they're going going this though

297
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,550
makes you a little higher up on the

298
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:40,890
Echelon of things to have things to get

299
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:42,780
into so the first thing is set up a for

300
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,120
anyone pick one honestly it doesn't

301
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,130
really matter they all kind of guide you

302
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,890
towards the end result that's the same

303
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:52,620
and we use NIST

304
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:54,240
mostly because one again if you are

305
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,160
doing anything with the government even

306
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,590
remotely related to the government you

307
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:04,410
have to there is tons and tons and tons

308
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,040
of documentation if you want to go to

309
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,160
sleep tonight

310
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,930
baby try to read through some of the

311
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:16,410
missed documentation it was painful but

312
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:19,319
it's complete and it is it gives you a

313
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,660
lot of good recommendations and there's

314
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:26,010
definitely rabbit holes you can go it's

315
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,480
adaptable so I mentioned 853 if you're

316
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,510
not familiar with that this is kind of

317
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,770
like the Grand Poobah of security

318
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:40,020
controls you have 53 this is basically

319
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:42,150
saying all possible ramifications I not

320
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,949
only do you monitor your audit logs but

321
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,500
you monitor that your audit logs are

322
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,810
still coming in and so you have Watchers

323
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,260
that watch the Watchers things like that

324
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:54,719
however you can go down to 171 this is

325
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,420
just if you have government data and

326
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,550
then you can customize 53 all the way

327
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,250
down to think is something like 60

328
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:04,530
something controllers but what that

329
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,970
means is depending on the size of your

330
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,490
organization depending on the security

331
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:12,240
to be bad depending on the needs that

332
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,950
you have you can start this now there's

333
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,400
the cybersecurity framework that's gonna

334
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:19,740
help you in guiding you as where where

335
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,750
are you versus where you want to go if

336
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,240
your maturity level and then if you

337
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,130
really want to inflict some pain on

338
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,830
yourself you can do the full of risk

339
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:31,230
management framework and this is where

340
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,940
you go in and you really define their

341
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,970
security controls you make sure that you

342
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,070
have your Enclave set up for particular

343
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:43,230
things this is really much honestly this

344
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:47,010
is for larger but it's adaptable and so

345
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:51,900
we work with this because it's a good

346
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:53,640
baseline it sets your baseline now if

347
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,660
you all know about nest and have an

348
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,860
understanding of that have an

349
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,260
understanding and frameworks that's

350
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:02,850
great where a lot of people fall down

351
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:05,940
and down is the next few steps we're

352
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,440
going to talk about so when you

353
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,090
establish the framework we'll talk about

354
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,280
really getting it up you going we

355
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:13,379
identify our scope we identified here's

356
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,010
what we're going to talk about here what

357
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,240
we're going to try to secure it right so

358
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,660
that doesn't mean it has to be your

359
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,460
entire environment you can start with a

360
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,410
remote office and say okay we've gotten

361
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,300
that one compliant now let's branch off

362
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,930
like that's the flexibility of NIST

363
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:34,290
there's like to do that as well you

364
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:36,090
identify your risk profiles how your do

365
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,700
we need to make this what kind of data

366
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,760
do we have how do we need to secure that

367
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:45,180
data we created a process that's of

368
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,330
course the framework now this this is

369
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,070
where most people fall down because to

370
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,389
most people framework when you hear the

371
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,270
word framework when you're the word

372
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,440
compliance what you think is here's a

373
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,200
list of things I need to do in my

374
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,920
environment that's what most people

375
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:05,900
think it's not what a framework is it is

376
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:09,810
parked for Frank that's like saying I

377
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:11,610
have a car and I have four wheels so

378
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,550
great I have a car I don't have anything

379
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,709
else you know

380
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:22,879
there's nothing else just for the wheels

381
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:24,740
but I'm not really this is obvious I

382
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,740
think it should be where you have you're

383
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,290
gonna get people involved and you select

384
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:34,700
what you do that's like I said except

385
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:37,850
for a few few specifics you pick what

386
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:40,760
you want and you pick the security that

387
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:42,530
your environment needs to be now in a

388
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,800
lot of times it's going to be forced

389
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:47,240
upon you so we use NIST however we've

390
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,530
had several customers when we start with

391
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,360
PCI is PCI great framework not really

392
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:55,100
but if you have to be PCI compliant in

393
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,600
six months and you're nowhere near that

394
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,080
well that's what we start with and then

395
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,179
we kind of meld it into this so that's

396
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,290
where the magic catalyst setting up for

397
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,560
those of you who may not be familiar

398
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:08,149
with frameworks and really honestly how

399
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,129
they work not just here's all the

400
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,240
controls let me afternoon this is what

401
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:16,040
you gotta do but that's not really the

402
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:19,100
magic it's done so at first we perform a

403
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,710
risk assessment this again is something

404
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:25,879
that a lot of people don't do quite

405
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:28,010
frankly it is very valuable and again

406
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,180
most people start with a penetration

407
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:34,670
test that's going backwards you set up

408
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,560
everything first you get all your ducks

409
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:41,510
in a row then you perform a penetration

410
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:44,030
tester it's like hiring a thief to break

411
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:46,210
into your house and you forget to leave

412
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,770
and you leave the front door open

413
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:51,080
well you just paid this person a lot of

414
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:54,410
money to just say oh okay well thank you

415
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,580
take everything you have it's the same

416
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,370
thing you don't perform a risk

417
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,409
assessment they know where you are

418
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:02,149
you don't know where you're going so we

419
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,650
identify all the missing documentation

420
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:06,580
this looks familiar

421
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:08,350
this is all the stuff that we do

422
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,090
when we're preparing and we're in a rush

423
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:14,679
right this is this is everything that

424
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:18,669
that we do anyway but again not really

425
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:21,220
really milk magic palette we establish

426
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:23,440
compensating controls I always tell

427
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,690
clients this is not compensating

428
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,790
controls this is complicating controls

429
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,370
because we try to implement compensating

430
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,440
controls them this makes your life apart

431
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,850
everybody wants to do complan everybody

432
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,410
wants to do compensating controls

433
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,899
because they think it makes it easier no

434
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,610
it actually makes it harder if you're

435
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,680
doing things properly you then assess

436
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:43,149
and this is where you get the audit and

437
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,040
then you perform a risk assessment again

438
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,450
because quite frankly this is probably

439
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,490
either after you've performed the first

440
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,140
one you need to go through it again just

441
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,540
make sure you've actually implemented it

442
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,520
for example we had a customer that we

443
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,129
were doing in store we performed a risk

444
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,950
assessment they weren't all that bad

445
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:02,260
they had a lot of next-gen filming the

446
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,630
blanket doesn't really matter they had a

447
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,120
lot of next-gen stuff and so yeah you

448
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,500
know the perimeter was kind of secured

449
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,989
they had some you know endpoint

450
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,790
protection I was pretty good and so we

451
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,380
went through this process help them

452
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:17,649
establish the framework and did things

453
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,600
like that and we're pretty hands-off

454
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,280
about it because they wanted to do that

455
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:27,040
most of them self so we perform a risk

456
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:29,440
assessment again now this is a large law

457
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:34,210
firm that has clients that you have

458
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:37,440
heard of and while interviewing people

459
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:40,540
we find out that the database

460
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,420
administrator decided that all these

461
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,710
controls really make my job difficult so

462
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,870
I'm going to take a copy of the database

463
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,580
on an unencrypted us being taken home

464
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:50,129
for me to work on the database that's

465
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,639
easy

466
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:56,100
they were complying except for that one

467
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,800
sir

468
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,169
so you need a risk assessment I have

469
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:05,070
other stories a lot of other stories

470
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:07,080
like that and so you've got to perform a

471
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:14,540
risk assessment in order to understand

472
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:21,480
where was I did I do a good job now this

473
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:23,129
is where really what we do is something

474
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,770
that a lot of people haven't seen they

475
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:29,430
may have seen yes I know I need to set

476
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:32,120
up a program I know I need to set up my

477
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:36,090
policies and procedures and the thing is

478
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:40,530
when you do that with NIST you have to

479
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:43,139
you have to put that as part of your

480
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:47,430
operating procedures that is the thing

481
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:49,530
that 95% of all corporations that I've

482
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,230
stepped foot into that is their problem

483
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:54,090
where they fall that they have their

484
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,590
controls they put their controls into

485
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:59,100
place and then they don't monitor it

486
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,570
then they don't have change control that

487
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,379
tracks it not only tracks that it

488
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,360
happening if it has approvals but also

489
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,240
you update your documentation you update

490
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,100
your security plan you update your

491
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,900
framework that that's where a lot of

492
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,820
people fall down and so when they start

493
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,130
to get audited they know an audit comes

494
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,840
they're not ready because wait a minute

495
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,000
the last time we updated our firewall

496
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,280
configuration documentation was two

497
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:29,160
years ago and we actually put in a new

498
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:30,750
firewall and forgotten I've seen that so

499
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,940
once you do that great

500
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:37,170
you've got NIST what about the others

501
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:40,970
how many of you in here have more than

502
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:43,970
one compliance we have to be up meet

503
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,970
right

504
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:52,649
so the thing is you don't have to

505
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:54,360
reinvent the wheel now I just picked ECI

506
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,640
miss because those are the ones I'm

507
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,520
definitely most familiar with but you

508
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,050
can really insert any acronym here that

509
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,720
has to do with compliance and guess what

510
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:05,220
you have to audit your logs have to

511
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,760
watch make sure nobody's doing anything

512
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:11,340
wet you've got to plan out your disaster

513
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:15,030
recovery and business continuity you've

514
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:17,330
got to look at your visible security now

515
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:21,660
there may be nuances between the two

516
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:23,520
between this and PCI and of course over

517
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,840
here on this Venn diagram you're going

518
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:30,480
to have do you have credit card

519
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:35,639
information but realistically the vast

520
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:38,820
majority of PCI and NIST overlap so what

521
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:42,600
then do you do well you don't go and

522
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,550
start down a PCI and say okay are we

523
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,629
monitoring our logs we're in S compliant

524
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,669
so of course we honor

525
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:55,140
let's go verify that no you already knew

526
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:56,310
more and so you make that that's

527
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,460
interesting

528
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:04,919
okay so well okay I have a few blank

529
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:09,420
slides so we perform a gap analysis this

530
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,020
is going to say what about PCI what

531
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,500
about HIPAA

532
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:17,280
what about whatever is unique compared

533
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:20,280
to the framework that I have and then

534
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,580
you identify the missing documentation

535
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:28,530
now guess what that take that takes PCI

536
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:29,939
from this much work to this much work we

537
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,670
have seen actually we have seen people

538
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,980
who are a piece who are Niska pliant we

539
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:36,330
have helped become miss compliant

540
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,860
they have properly implemented

541
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:41,939
everything become PC on this is a

542
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:47,280
multi-million dollar you're talking

543
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:50,460
probably around 700 seats or so I've

544
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:55,740
become PCI compliant in a month and a

545
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:59,160
half because they they have the matrix

546
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,780
set out so that all that's left is those

547
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,460
little things you know do you do you

548
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,660
have what do you crip the credit card

549
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,200
information and we can add credit

550
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:09,630
information things like that we then

551
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:14,880
establish the complicating controls if

552
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:18,360
we haven't we remediated and then we

553
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,880
maintain now this is again somewhere

554
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,790
where people fall down a lot if you

555
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,760
maintain if you make it a point that all

556
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:30,540
your processes

557
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:34,620
whenever the IT staff make a decision is

558
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:36,810
that going to affect our compliance if

559
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,780
so we need to put that into our friend

560
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:42,389
we need to put make an adjustment

561
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:44,879
every decision ok I'm going to you know

562
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,290
rip out this database server and put in

563
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,950
a new one because whatever version is

564
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:53,830
great still got to go in and update it's

565
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:56,890
cute now it's a lot of work yes but it

566
00:26:53,830 --> 00:27:00,040
means that when an audit comes on you're

567
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:05,760
ready not to do any maintaining is going

568
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,760
to be a huge part of that and that's

569
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:11,020
constantly stay up today this is

570
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,470
actually part of a lot of compliances

571
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:17,230
that you have to maintain you know

572
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:19,660
articles but hopefully you're doing that

573
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,130
anyway and then we test our security

574
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,040
controls because guess what that's what

575
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,390
the auditor is going to do we train

576
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:29,139
employees on the security plan this

577
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:31,840
happens two percent of the time where we

578
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,370
have everything in place but the people

579
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,809
performing the work the people making

580
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,340
the changes don't actually know that

581
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:39,250
when they do something they have to

582
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:43,470
update the security person this is Oh

583
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:46,030
whatever it happens to be that's happy

584
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:51,370
and then we make adjustments like I was

585
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:54,280
talking about that is what you've got to

586
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,879
do now is any of this secret sauce that

587
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:01,200
you've never heard no of course not

588
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,490
but very few people actually do this

589
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,559
they think it's more complicated than

590
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:08,470
rushing around to each compliance and

591
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:11,168
saying well we've got to meet PCI and

592
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:13,650
three months let's make that happen it's

593
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:18,820
not we've actually had customers that

594
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:20,919
we're planning on hiring customers that

595
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:23,230
were planning on hiring compliance

596
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,669
managers and and two or three people to

597
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,220
make sure that they have everything and

598
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:29,890
we've implemented this program for them

599
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,720
using the standard stuff it's freely

600
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,120
available just not many people dig into

601
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:38,290
it we implemented this program for them

602
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:39,520
and they don't have to hire because it's

603
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,960
just part of the way they do business

604
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,059
it's just a way

605
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,320
that things happen and that takes out a

606
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:47,418
lot of the stress you're able to

607
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,759
complete more projects were able to

608
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:52,429
address a lot of the other needs in your

609
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,990
environment if you just simply make sure

610
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:57,470
that this is part of it and then you

611
00:28:53,990 --> 00:29:01,899
marry the outside of the Venn diagram

612
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:07,940
together with that gives me two minutes

613
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:12,729
any questions so there's a problem that

614
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:15,470
I've seen companies face compliance is

615
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:18,649
actually doing it Brad so that's not

616
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:21,799
complying what is generating revenue I

617
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:23,600
guess how do you keep the moneymaker

618
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:26,450
that they need to do this all the time

619
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,549
like NPC acts on it but right now for

620
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,129
PCI times at the next patch for these

621
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:34,009
they expose your entire networks its own

622
00:29:31,129 --> 00:29:35,570
ability so to do this so that's a great

623
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:37,879
question and that's something that we

624
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:43,249
struggle with for a long time we have

625
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:45,529
seen a dramatic dip in customers when

626
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:48,139
they go out to win new business they

627
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:51,980
immediately get a vendor questionnaire

628
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:53,899
back and they say oh great we love your

629
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,059
product we want to purchase it make sure

630
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:57,918
you be with and then the people are

631
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:59,658
saying if they're they've done this they

632
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,580
said okay great here you go here's our

633
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:05,179
security plan here's all our controls or

634
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,769
tell me if they're not then they either

635
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:08,389
lose the contract or they're going to

636
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:11,330
have to run away run around and do all

637
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:15,258
these things we've actually seen a large

638
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:18,590
uptick it's really yeah we're not the

639
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:22,309
only ones there's it's probably in the

640
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:24,408
last year or so has been huge where you

641
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:25,029
have great we want to do business with

642
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:28,639
you

643
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:32,390
there's your vendor questionnaire and so

644
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:34,399
if you are doing this on a daily basis

645
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,230
you're doing and you're gonna go if

646
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,150
you're not then you run around and say

647
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,220
well we've kind of we'll get that to you

648
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:45,650
in a week and then everybody works you

649
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:47,570
know everybody works 25 hour days so

650
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:50,510
that's we've actually we've actually

651
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,760
seen it and it's it's going to spray

652
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:59,750
they haven't seen it that will happen to

653
00:30:52,760 --> 00:31:03,110
the wind business in fact I was talking

654
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:05,690
to somebody who runs the vendor

655
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:10,909
compliance at one of the group classes

656
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:12,470
and he said we give them two days if

657
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:17,809
they don't respond in two days we know

658
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:19,970
they're not ready and so he said we've

659
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:22,100
had named names

660
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:25,400
but we've had you know vendors you've

661
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,629
heard of and they they say well we'll

662
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,460
take about a week to get up in your

663
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:31,309
honor you're not doing this as part of

664
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:34,419
your process not a question or comment

665
00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:41,020
that especially that or that piece I

666
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:43,490
have the area calling these things

667
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,740
unified controls matrix column control

668
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:48,530
entry so I would curse you all I was

669
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,270
working in Adobe so they made their just

670
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:52,309
a little Dooley common controls matrix

671
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:54,980
so that whole of us overlap how do I do

672
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:55,460
one assessment but needed to do all

673
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,340
right

674
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,870
they made it open source so in just

675
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,679
Google Adobe comp

676
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:06,110
you don't have to look at Google

677
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:08,090
crosswalk so look at you know mist or

678
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,590
whatever it happens to be crosswalk in

679
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,439
fact mean is for example mist has

680
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:15,379
there's actually a specification 800 -

681
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,150
66 but you don't even have to look it up

682
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:20,480
they basically say here's all that extra

683
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:21,650
you've got to do this let's say yeah

684
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,059
you're exactly right people are

685
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,590
providing that as a service but they're

686
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:27,230
also there's a lot of them out there who

687
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:29,780
are but but again and I'm sure you will

688
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,179
agree with me on this that's only part

689
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,610
of it just knowing what you have to do

690
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:36,980
security controls wise it's only part

691
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,659
the other part is actually implementing

692
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,970
it and putting it into daily practice

693
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:43,250
and have some important I'm just saying

694
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:46,160
do I have that yes or no okay we're good

695
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,320
now you're not gonna get a point across

696
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,090
I'm way over but if there's any other

697
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,639
questions feel free to come down

698
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:56,799
otherwise enjoy your watch

699
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,799
[Applause]
