1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,399
hello everyone and uh thank you for

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,400
finding the time to join uh the first

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,880
besides pristina conference uh it's a

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,160
pleasure for me uh to have the honor to

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,320
be a speaker at the uh very first event

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
of this type in pristina uh today uh my

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,240
talk is about uh red teaming uh maybe uh

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,840
many of you that already have some

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,279
experience in cyber security or

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,359
offensive security already know what red

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,719
teaming is uh but for uh the rest of you

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,280
that uh don't have uh a specific

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,360
knowledge on this uh type of engagement

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,600
uh we're gonna go through it together uh

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
so i'll start with a brief uh

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,280
introduction or a short bio of me uh so

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,640
uh my name is rodon goshi and uh i am a

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,719
senior uh security consultant at century

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,719
cyber security i'm currently leading a

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,120
team of five security consultants and uh

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,079
before that i was a uh a penetration

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
tester from 2018 to uh 2012 uh

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,400
uh and 2020. uh my achievements uh

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,119
include some ctf uh

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,000
competitions including uh some from

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,320
cyber defense week and from ubt cert in

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,720
kosovo uh i've also had the honor to be

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,600
in the top 10 uh of uh ranking on the

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,920
hack the box platform i believe many of

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,439
you have already heard of it

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,520
so what this talk will not cover uh

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,960
all of you that already have some

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,799
knowledge for red teaming engagements uh

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,640
you are all familiar with the tools i

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,759
have uh uploaded on this slide so uh

36
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,759
first we have cobalt strike and

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,600
bloodhound and we also have some edr

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,640
evasion techniques uh this uh this

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,799
particular engagement uh was not a

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,040
traditional engagement uh me and my

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
colleagues we make some jokes about uh

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,280
cobalt strike we say it's like a game

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
you just uh hey cobalt strike generator

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,159
payload hey cobalt strike get the shell

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,320
here so uh that's no that's not really

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,640
fun uh but we tried to come up with some

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,680
more uh creative ideas and uh to focus

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,878
on the fun part uh of the these types of

49
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,959
engagements

50
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,200
so the uh presentation will cover how

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,440
red teaming engagement is executed by

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,319
using real life examples and also here

53
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,480
we have the life cycle of a red teaming

54
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,640
engagement which includes uh mostly

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,480
reconnaissance and attack planning and

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
then is the part uh where the execution

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
actually comes

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,840
the reconnaissance and attack planning

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,480
phases are uh separated into initial

60
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,640
reconnaissance attack planning and then

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,959
the execution phase uh is split into

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,440
initial compromise maintaining access uh

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,959
internal reconnaissance privilege

64
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,840
escalation and lateral movement uh

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,080
for most red teaming engagements the

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,400
most difficult part is the first part

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
which is reconnaissance and attack

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
planning because we have to uh find an

69
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,840
initial attack vector and we have to

70
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,680
gather as much information as we can

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
about this specific company that we are

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,560
targeting so that's usually the

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,840
longest and the hardest part of the

74
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,480
engagement

75
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,280
uh

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
some uh forms of reconnaissance and

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
attack planning uh include uh

78
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,480
virtual uh

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
reconnaissance basically where we try to

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,640
find out as much information as we can

81
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,519
about the client in this example uh i

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,159
have uh put two pictures that the client

83
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,360
uh uploaded in their uh gallery uh so by

84
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
using these images uh we were able to

85
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,519
identify their internal communication

86
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,360
platforms uh which were slack and

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
discord

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,239
as you all know slack and discord are

89
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,000
very convenient and

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,519
a lot of

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,599
people that are oriented to technology

92
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,159
use them for everyday communication but

93
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,640
we'll get to that later

94
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,440
another very uh critical part of uh

95
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,519
attack planning is mapping out the

96
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,080
internal uh uh hair hierarchy of an

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
organization uh what that means is that

98
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,439
we have to uh see who uh uh

99
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,239
important people of the organization or

100
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,239
so we don't attack

101
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,159
the low privileged guys the guys who

102
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,360
don't have access to a lot of

103
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,159
information but we try to map out who is

104
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,879
the most important and we can uh plan

105
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,080
our attacks accordingly

106
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,478
other steps uh include for example

107
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,320
identification of employees by using

108
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,279
social media i've used an example for uh

109
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,680
when we utilized linkedin filters to

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,000
identify employees in this way we can

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,520
get a uh almost full uh picture of uh

112
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,759
who is working uh for this specific

113
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,800
company and uh uh also about uh their

114
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,040
roles and their responsibilities so we

115
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,160
can uh better create that uh hierarchy

116
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,919
that we already talked about another

117
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,720
example is for example uh when we

118
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
uh

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
when we start an engagement the client

120
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,160
usually gives out some initial details

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,240
about their company uh where they are

122
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,919
located and stuff like that but we can

123
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,600
also use that information

124
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,840
for example by using who is data for isp

125
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,520
identification

126
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,320
this is a very important step in uh

127
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,840
a next slide that we're going to talk

128
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,159
about

129
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
another critical phase is physically

130
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,360
mapping out the company headquarters uh

131
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,520
for those so we can use uh physical uh

132
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,440
scouting uh of the environment for

133
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,639
example uh where their headquarters are

134
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,680
and uh

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,639
we in that way we can try to find uh

136
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,440
entry points and we can try to find uh

137
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
entry uh

138
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
security mechanisms that may include uh

139
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,560
pin uh numbers or uh badges or access

140
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,280
cards or stuff like that we can also uh

141
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,520
try to identify who the

142
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,840
responsible person from the staff is for

143
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,759
entrance and the clearance of the of the

144
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,560
staff that's usually a worker that is on

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,039
the front door of the company and

146
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,840
basically knows everyone and

147
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,639
gives them access as requested

148
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,560
i have mentioned bra which is the

149
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,720
business registration agency of kosovo

150
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,440
or as we say it in albanian arabica this

151
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,960
is a very

152
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,319
important

153
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,319
part that we can use because

154
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,120
in

155
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,280
bra every business must be registered

156
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,000
and use their physical address so if we

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,680
cannot find the address of the

158
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,759
headquarters for the client uh by using

159
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,759
other identified identification

160
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,240
mechanisms uh we can just resort back to

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,440
uh bra and by law they are required to

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,960
put the physical address of their

163
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,600
headquarters there

164
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,840
initial access time

165
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,360
physical access via trusted

166
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,720
relationships in this case we disguised

167
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,479
one of our colleagues as an isp

168
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,800
technician as you can see in the uh i'm

169
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,639
sorry but the resolution is not very

170
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,759
good but

171
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,400
in this picture you can see the uniforms

172
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,280
for two isps that the client was using

173
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,440
uh one was their main isp and the other

174
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
was one of their backup isps in case the

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
first one fails

176
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,080
so this was uh via trusted relationship

177
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,440
uh

178
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,599
disguised as a nice isp technician and

179
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,080
the other initial access vector was

180
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,759
phishing via email and physically

181
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,319
distributing the giraffe vpn which is a

182
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,599
trojan

183
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,880
now giraffa vpn you many of you probably

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,160
have heard of giraffa it's the biggest

185
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,800
local online store and it also offers a

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
lot of services

187
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
for kosovo people

188
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,039
so

189
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,120
we came up with an idea

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,960
to create a

191
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,120
fake vpn that is named giraffa vpn so

192
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,039
if we go to the company headquarters and

193
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,840
present the idea everybody will be happy

194
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,840
we will say uh oh you have been chosen

195
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,520
to know to beta test this vpn and it

196
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,960
will

197
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,479
we will require your feedback for

198
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,560
further improvement and stuff like that

199
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,680
everybody

200
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,400
in that case trusted us and

201
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,360
we managed to deliver a trojan horse by

202
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,120
disguising it as giraffa vvm

203
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,960
going back to physical access via

204
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
trusted relationships

205
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,720
the goal was to plant network implants

206
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,680
to aid in initial access if other things

207
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,879
fail

208
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,520
those equipment usually include rubber

209
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
duckies land turtle and packet squirrels

210
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,639
which are

211
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,400
all uh evil

212
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,000
tools that we use in red teaming

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,160
engagements and the attack scenario was

214
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,240
that uh one of our team members visits

215
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,919
the client's headquarters and insists

216
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,520
they need to see the server room uh

217
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,879
because someone from the staff has been

218
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,319
complaining that the network is not

219
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,720
working and they are there to

220
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,400
help troubleshoot the problem

221
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,679
giraffa vpn or the not so secure vpn

222
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,880
client

223
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,958
it has command and control capabilities

224
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,399
it's fully undetectable by current

225
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,880
protection solutions it actually works

226
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,200
we've pinpointed it to a aws server and

227
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,000
the vpn actually works so you can't uh

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,399
see what's going on

229
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,640
it's developed in python electron gs and

230
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,399
it uses google pub sub for uh

231
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,720
communication it is also integrated into

232
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,560
a telegram but so we can use it as our

233
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,600
command and control uh point uh the

234
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,160
telegram bot also alerts the controller

235
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,640
whenever it is executed uh here is a

236
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,240
screenshot of the

237
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,399
of the actual software but i don't think

238
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,800
you can actually see that clearly and uh

239
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,640
on the right uh there are the control

240
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
and uh command and control capabilities

241
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,040
by executing the system info comment uh

242
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,360
just as a uh demo for the for the

243
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,120
product

244
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,839
uh this included uh creatively gifting

245
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,120
of the evil

246
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,600
mercantiles uh so uh we created some

247
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,240
toad bags some access badges notebooks

248
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,040
and t-shirts and of course the usb which

249
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,839
contained the uh the trojan horse that

250
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,480
was disguised as uh giraffa vpn in this

251
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,360
way uh we maximize the chances for the

252
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,920
cl for the actual uh client to believe

253
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,640
us that we are a legit company and uh

254
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,720
the the initial access will be way more

255
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
easier in this way

256
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,240
going back to phishing attacks attacks

257
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,279
we

258
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,200
usually phishing attacks are conducted

259
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,279
via various channels such as social

260
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,800
media or

261
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,120
phone calls or emails

262
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,760
et cetera in this case we also used

263
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,880
giraffa because the company had software

264
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,680
developers that worked there and we

265
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,279
kind of knew that

266
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,519
the chances for them to order something

267
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,240
on giraffe were very high so we faked an

268
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,680
email uh

269
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,480
saying that the order has been confirmed

270
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,680
we also uh in the right part you can see

271
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,360
the look alike domain name that we

272
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,160
bought that's not actually jarafa 50 is

273
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,920
jarafa50 so the disguise was

274
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,839
in my personal opinion it was pretty

275
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,720
good and the results were also pretty

276
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,279
good uh over 15 different employees

277
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,959
clicked on untrusted links and fell

278
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,640
victim of that phishing attack that

279
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,240
included entering credentials or

280
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,640
downloading malicious software into

281
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,440
their

282
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,399
company computers

283
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,640
all right so after initial access time

284
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,399
uh it's time to abuse internal

285
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,079
applications

286
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,680
the main communication channels that

287
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
were used were discord and slack we

288
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,040
talked about that earlier and now it's

289
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,360
the the really interesting part

290
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,120
also in this phase we're going to talk

291
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,079
about

292
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,440
other misconfigured internal

293
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,000
applications such as team city and vdq

294
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,880
inventory the result of all this were

295
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,680
lots of creds

296
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,000
so going back to discord

297
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,160
once we identified that the client uses

298
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,440
discord for

299
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,680
internal communication we were able to

300
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,839
copy the whole directory of discord of

301
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,399
one of the uh infected uh

302
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,720
company's staff and by just pasting it

303
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,560
into a virtual machine we were able to

304
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,959
obtain an active session on their

305
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,440
discord channel what this allowed for us

306
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,320
is that we were able to uh

307
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,160
to create a mass surveillance of the

308
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,079
communication that was happening inside

309
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,040
and we also uh were aware of any uh

310
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,760
issues that the uh staff were reporting

311
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,800
of how they structure their passwords

312
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,519
where do they store sensitive data

313
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,519
how do they troubleshoot physical access

314
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,639
problems etc

315
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,560
slack the attack vector is identical as

316
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,480
in discord we were able to copy the main

317
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,639
directory and push it on a new virtual

318
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,600
machine we got an active session uh on

319
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
their slack channel the result of this

320
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,519
was that the company was uh

321
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,519
communicating with uh

322
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,160
external clients by using slack and a

323
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,240
lot of client data were leaked in that

324
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,639
process

325
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,120
now for the team city team city is a

326
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,880
build management software

327
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,440
offered by intellij i believe and if

328
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,920
misconfigured it can lead to various

329
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,399
problems uh in this case the application

330
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,639
was using the default credentials which

331
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,560
are usually admin admin or admin

332
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,040
password you can find a list usually

333
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
online for every application and their

334
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,600
uh default credentials

335
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,000
uh since we got initial access on this

336
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
application uh we were able to load the

337
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
custom script which was a payload for a

338
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,079
reverse shell and the tim city uh

339
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,680
service was running with administrator

340
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,800
privileges

341
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,880
the result was an anti-authority system

342
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,800
shell which uh for you that don't know

343
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,319
is a very highly privileged shell

344
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,320
more traditional stuff on this red

345
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,720
teaming engagements includes run finger

346
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,000
crack map exact evil win rm impact and

347
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,240
other standard red team utilities

348
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
however this was uh

349
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
those tools were helpful but the main

350
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,519
focus was not here

351
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,160
the underlying issue uh in the in this

352
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,560
engagement was the weak passwords uh

353
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,480
configuration insecure storage of

354
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
credentials and the the human factor

355
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,959
that uh people tend to forget passwords

356
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,959
they don't use password managers uh they

357
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,440
are always prone to saving passwords uh

358
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,560
in uh files which are easily accessible

359
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,240
in case they just access a laptop and

360
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,480
can't figure out the password they just

361
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
say oh i'll push it on a sticky note or

362
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,079
i'll just save it on my desktop for

363
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,399
another service and so on and so forth

364
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,160
i've put a list of some of the files

365
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,680
that were identified during the

366
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
engagement which included the bitlocker

367
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,360
keys used for the encryption of the

368
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,240
whole company's

369
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,720
hardware the

370
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,519
the second file which is the acc

371
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,199
underlying path this was a local

372
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,040
administrator account that was enabled

373
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,199
on all company devices

374
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
the third one is the git credentials

375
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
which one of the developers saved and

376
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,240
there were credentials for github which

377
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
gave us access to internal code and to

378
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,639
see how they work things out the result

379
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,880
was an administrative access on over 100

380
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,800
staff computers by using the local

381
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
administrator account that was enabled

382
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
that was enabled on all devices i've

383
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,440
also included a list of some passwords

384
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,760
cracked but i don't think you can see it

385
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,920
here

386
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,440
uh to crack those passwords at ease and

387
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,079
since this was a time box engagement and

388
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,920
meaning that we were limited uh on the

389
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
amount of time that we can spend on this

390
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,240
one we use the cracking station by using

391
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
some online services that uh

392
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,920
provide virtual actually they provide

393
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,160
physical graphics cards so we can just

394
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
run them and we can use them for our own

395
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,279
purpose we used a combination of several

396
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,760
geforce rtx graphic cards and kraken

397
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,360
anti-alarm hashes

398
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,959
was very fast and efficient

399
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,680
missing security patches

400
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,279
some may think that they are not a big

401
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,279
deal some may just uh

402
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,519
postpone that some system administrators

403
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,839
are tend to be a little bit more lazy

404
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,440
than others and they just say i'll do

405
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,519
that next month i'll do that next week

406
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,199
but are they really a big deal the

407
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,399
client uh was vulnerable to zero logon

408
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,079
which was uh cve 2020 1472. uh at that

409
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,639
time it was a little-known uh

410
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,399
exploit uh but by using uh the publicly

411
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,880
available poc we were able to identify

412
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,120
that the client is vulnerable and as a

413
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,079
result

414
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,360
we had a

415
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,720
domain administration domain

416
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,360
administrative access on the

417
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,759
active directory of the client

418
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,920
after that we used impact to dump some

419
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,079
credentials to further spread into the

420
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,880
network uh there we saw some credentials

421
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,040
for pdq deploy

422
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,000
uh what is pdq deploy pdq pdq deploy and

423
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,079
pdq inventory are applications that are

424
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,000
used by mostly used by system

425
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,639
administrators to manage the computers

426
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,160
of their staff

427
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
remotely so by not going and

428
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
troubleshooting problems for each of

429
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,759
them individually

430
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,720
the pdq deploy

431
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,759
and vdq inventory applications store

432
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,440
their credentials in local security

433
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
authority secrets which can be dumped by

434
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,000
using the uh impacted python module

435
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,079
secrets dump many of you have heard of

436
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,160
it for you that haven't heard of impact

437
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,000
i totally recommend to go on their

438
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,079
github and see what the project is about

439
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,240
it's a very helpful project

440
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,880
here i have attached a screenshot of the

441
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,440
pdq inventory app this was basically a

442
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,800
remote

443
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,279
access tool and at that point we had

444
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,040
full control over the whole

445
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,839
infrastructure of the client

446
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,160
the end result uh was that we were able

447
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,839
to compromise domain administrative

448
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,079
accounts uh we compromised business

449
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,599
emails we compromised internal

450
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,240
communication systems uh client data and

451
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,079
internal applications

452
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,079
to highlight this impact for the

453
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,240
executive part of the company

454
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,679
the executive part of the company

455
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,599
usually tends not to really understand

456
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,199
the technical stuff

457
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,960
so to highlight that impact better we

458
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,559
use some

459
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,240
pictures taken from internal computer

460
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,160
cameras uh we key logs sensitive

461
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,080
information and recorded uh voice

462
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
messages via microphone here you can see

463
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,080
uh one picture taken from an internal

464
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,039
camera uh on the second uh picture there

465
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,000
are some redacted client data and on the

466
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,480
third one there is a screenshot of an

467
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,640
active computer that was within the

468
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
network uh

469
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,760
this is the

470
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,440
the last slide of the presentation and

471
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,919
for that i'll try uh to ask you to

472
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,760
please remember that red teaming can be

473
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,000
very fun if you wanted to be and let's

474
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,480
just not go always on the traditional

475
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,120
ways because they are not so fun thank

476
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,120
you
