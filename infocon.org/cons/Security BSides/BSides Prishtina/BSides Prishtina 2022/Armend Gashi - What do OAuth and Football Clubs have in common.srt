1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,839
uh so who's ready to have some football

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,120
um

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,960
all right a short video i'm arnold

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,519
gauschi i'm a senior penetration tester

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,480
at century and prior to being part of

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
century i attended the ciacp program at

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,720
cyber academy guided by dre north monae

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,240
throughout this time in century i had

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,480
the opportunity to participate in a lot

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,880
of engagements that included but were

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
not limited to application penetration

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,760
testing such as web mobile or

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,559
uh

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,079
say clients they included also cloud

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,360
infrastructures in uh aws azure and

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,000
google cloud platform apis internal

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,760
external penetration testing real team

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,160
and engagements and social engineering

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,399
what i also define crucial for for our

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,280
career as uh penetration testers is

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,000
taking care of of of your burnouts as

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
it's so easy to get burned out in this

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,800
career so

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,840
what i do i try to enjoy my my free time

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,160
which mainly include playing drums but

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
of course i'm listening to some cool

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,519
heavy metal music

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,560
so

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,920
uh the outline for this presentation

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,960
will be how to hack uh a lot of football

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
clubs so i have a question for our

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,360
audience do you have any ideas what do

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,680
oauth and football clubs have in common

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,960
all right so um what they do have in

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,640
common is the audience and i'm going to

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,360
tell you why in a few minutes so the the

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,119
outline will cover

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,320
of open id connect which will cover a

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,840
general overview on how they work and

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,640
what they are and some of their features

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,720
such as dynamic client registration

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,439
they're uh the risks that they pose and

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,520
the hard-coded secrets and the risks

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,640
that they pose and how did we compromise

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
the majority of the most prominent

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,880
football clubs apart from it we also

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,840
have a bonus outline that includes

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,880
cosmos databases and how to escape the

49
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,240
kiosk

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,520
so

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,360
what is the walls and open id so

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,680
basically oauth is an authorization

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,878
protocol that allows uh users to sign in

54
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,319
using their google account or their

55
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,200
facebook account today to the uh

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,080
to the application meanwhile open id is

57
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
a protocol that is mainly

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,879
focused on uh it is mainly focused on

59
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,280
the authentication process so the main

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,120
difference between authentication and

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,879
authorization is that with

62
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,680
authentication the application tries to

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
uh to know who you are and with

64
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,920
authorization basically

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,400
it restricts the scope on which data or

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,959
which files you have uh access to

67
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,239
throughout this talk some of the

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,800
terminologies that we might need are the

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,879
client credentials which include client

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,440
id and client secret which are similar

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,400
to

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,040
username and password uh we might also

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,680
need the the scope which is basically

74
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
your limitation towards those

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,000
credentials within the application and

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
the audience which is the intended

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,440
recipient

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,840
of the token so merchandiser information

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,760
will be able to hack the majority of the

80
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,680
most football clubs

81
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,560
so the methodology for this engagement

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,360
was

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
uh since it was using the openid connect

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,560
we tried to grab the open id

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,599
configuration which led to the dynamic

86
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,239
client registration endpoint which led

87
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,720
to a failed attempt to perform uh

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
dynamic client registration so initially

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,680
then we proceeded to uh

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
with a initial authentication request

91
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,840
which generated the following scope

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
highlighted in red and we also got an

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,319
access token which was limited only to

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,400
our our set of data and we could not

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,239
really really escape that apart from an

96
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,400
insecure direct object reference that we

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,319
identified in the application

98
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,360
but it was very limited as you can see

99
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,239
down

100
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,360
here the the id uh highlighted in red is

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
a unique identifier in the hex format

102
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
not easily resourceable and the

103
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,159
attacking surface was very limited even

104
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,720
though they retrieved data include uh

105
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,360
passwords of their database that were

106
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,000
hosted locally in the in the targeted

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,478
infrastructure but again the attacking

108
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,798
surface is limited and we could not

109
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,798
really do anything with that

110
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,759
next we have also identified a

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,199
another uh

112
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,280
insecure direct logic reference which

113
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,360
was uh read only access control flow

114
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,160
by supplying the administrator's email

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
address we were able to retrieve a lot

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,880
of sensitive information that included

117
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
all the football players some of the

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,960
most prominent football clubs and

119
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,880
it included their name their last name

120
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
their date of birth they unique

121
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,479
identifier that we might

122
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,600
be using later what is their max heart

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
rate when they are running and their

124
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,160
resting heart rate so on and so forth

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,600
and

126
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,280
initially then

127
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,080
we will try to to see if there is any

128
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,240
any sensitive information stored in the

129
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,960
applications configuration files this

130
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,560
this was also a sc client so this led to

131
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
some very sensitive information that was

132
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,680
the client id and the client secret and

133
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,600
performing the authentication request

134
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,680
with the client credentials grant type

135
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
led to the

136
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,600
to the following scope that would allow

137
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,320
us to read all of the users update any

138
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,400
of the users and delete any of the users

139
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,240
which could lead to a potential denial

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,400
of service for the for the application

141
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,960
and they could they could not offer uh

142
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,600
their service anymore so now that we

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,960
have this scope and we have this

144
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,600
json web token what is our next step the

145
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,320
next step is that we might we might want

146
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,720
to to view at the official api

147
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,680
documentation of oauth and see how we

148
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,720
can abuse all of these legitimate uh

149
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,800
functionalities within the application

150
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,520
so i've navigated to the to the official

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
documentation and uh and noticed that

152
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
all of these actions are legitimate and

153
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
we can perform uh

154
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,919
any of that action moving forward

155
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,400
this is the uh the attacking scenario

156
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,240
that uh that we have

157
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,000
come up for so firstly we have

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
registered the we have listed the

159
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,759
registered users and then we have

160
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,600
grabbed the administrator's email

161
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
address and then we could also change

162
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,280
that password and then you could take

163
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,199
over the football club you name it uh

164
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,520
proceeding with that to list

165
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,440
these users i've listed here some

166
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,600
endpoints but i don't think you can see

167
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
them but it's okay

168
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,960
so it's the api slash v2 slash users

169
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,199
which lists all the available users then

170
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,840
we could list the users by their id or

171
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,919
list their roles or list them by their

172
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,840
email address

173
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,759
moving forward to

174
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,919
compromise the football club you name it

175
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:56,800
we

176
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,599
would need to send a patch

177
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,960
request to this uh end point which is

178
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,639
all zero pipe the unique identifier that

179
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,280
we could have grabbed from the uh from

180
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,240
the listing uh request that we have

181
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,639
initiated uh previously

182
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,960
and then as as a penetration tester we

183
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,919
all know that

184
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,080
it's it's never enough to to perform

185
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,840
hacking so we have we have proceeded to

186
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,080
hack even more so in this case we have

187
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,039
the penalty round where there's a bonus

188
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,440
outline and the bonus outline is that

189
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
the application was throwing even more

190
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,039
hard-coded secrets that included

191
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,280
the application's

192
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
connection strength to their cosmos

193
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,479
database and using that

194
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,160
connection string

195
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,360
then we were we were able to to perform

196
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,120
a lot of actions such as connect to

197
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,080
their database and then view all of the

198
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,879
players information in this list we

199
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,680
could we could name some of the best

200
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,560
football teams like chelsea or paris and

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,639
german so on and so forth and all of

202
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,560
their players their data and we could

203
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,360
read them modify them and also we could

204
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,639
delete them

205
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,759
um

206
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,360
so as the last bonus outline we had the

207
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,759
the kiosk escape so basically the

208
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,680
applications uh

209
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,680
browser render engine was not properly

210
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,840
configured which allowed us to navigate

211
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,000
to to the settings and then after

212
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
navigating to the settings we were able

213
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,319
to uh to pop that cmd with the

214
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,759
anti-authority

215
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,639
uh permissions so

216
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,440
using this way we were able to

217
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,479
uh

218
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,360
to

219
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,000
play we are the championship queen

220
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,880
so yeah that's the way how how we hacked

221
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,080
uh the most of the football clubs in the

222
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
in the world so thank you for your

223
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,480
attention any questions
