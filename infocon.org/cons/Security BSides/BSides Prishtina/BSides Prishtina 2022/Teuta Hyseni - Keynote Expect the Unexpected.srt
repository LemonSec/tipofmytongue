1
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,320
my coworker

2
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,320
and i touched that

3
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,520
anyway so

4
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,439
i just felt compelled to say a couple of

5
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,920
words in albania because i was born in

6
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,880
colorado so

7
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,560
but i just said

8
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,799
it's an amazing opportunity

9
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,680
actually this is amazing to see besides

10
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,640
in pristina this is the first time um as

11
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,720
you might know besides it's a really

12
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,600
large conference that is held across the

13
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,000
across the world so this is just a

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,079
testimony that proves that even in

15
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,520
kosovo uh in pristina we have a lot of

16
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
youth and vibrant

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,719
people who are also

18
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,639
contributing to the

19
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,360
industry of cyberspecificity

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,520
also this is pretty special for me

21
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,400
because

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,120
i not all the time i have family in the

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,280
audience so this is also another reason

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,480
why i feel like

25
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,160
really stressful actually it's more

26
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,440
stressful than if i when i don't but

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,760
um and also

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,520
um this is just a

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
great start i i'm actually hopeful for

30
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,120
the future

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,200
anyway so i'm gonna just talk a little

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,120
bit about myself um

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,440
yeah i i mean i have i could talk with

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,319
ours but i just want to say that

35
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,720
i was born here i was born in jilan i

36
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,319
finished the high school and elementary

37
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,480
school in jilan

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,519
and so

39
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,160
i just got it i got

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,200
lucky

41
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,959
of course you know when you get lucky

42
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:55,920
you know

43
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,599
it's not always

44
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,120
they uh

45
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
it's not always like you don't kind of

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,080
harvest the fruit you know right away

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,959
you usually do the hard work in front so

48
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,159
then uh that's what happened to me i i i

49
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,480
got a full tuition scholarship uh to

50
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,640
study at texas lutheran university

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,120
uh which you know was kind of a dream

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
come true for me it was there it was

53
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,440
actually surreal to me very beginning

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
because i did not know a lot about texas

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,200
but anyway

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,920
so

57
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,319
through the years i finished my

58
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,720
bachelor of science degree in computer

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
information system and a minor in

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,799
business administration

61
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,400
and i started working as a software

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,599
engineer

63
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,480
um

64
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,920
it was interesting because i

65
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,400
i was like

66
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,360
whenever i started my first work was as

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,319
intern

68
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,519
i was also lucky to get at rackspace

69
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,400
rackspace is like was one of the biggest

70
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,319
cloud computing companies

71
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,120
as an intern i was the only one out of

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,680
40 to actually work on a really

73
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,360
sensitive project

74
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,760
i was paired with a

75
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,280
ex-professor

76
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,360
um and he was i don't know like what

77
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,640
kind of

78
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,000
engineer he was the highest one i think

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,920
i don't know but

80
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,320
imagine me as an intern working with a

81
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,600
really knowledgeable person um my selfie

82
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,079
team definitely suffered a lot but i

83
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,000
learned that's like

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,880
when i don't know like to me whenever i

85
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,440
know that i don't know that's when

86
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,000
yeah the moment of um i guess like

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,759
improvement is so

88
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,880
that's what happened um and so after

89
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,440
that i moved to another company i worked

90
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,600
as a consultant again as a software

91
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,639
engineer

92
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,479
i think maybe

93
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,440
if you

94
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,040
um follow my talks i mentioned this

95
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,800
i don't i actually did not want i mean i

96
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,080
don't know i did not really have a

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,040
understanding and i was not like

98
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,199
sure that i guess like whenever i worked

99
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,320
on the future

100
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,479
i did not like to work with security

101
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,960
because they always bring more work

102
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,240
um and so but anyway i got like assigned

103
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
to help someone during christmas with a

104
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,280
project

105
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,080
in application security and so

106
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,560
uh during that time um

107
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,919
i did not know what to expect because i

108
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,520
did not know a lot about cyber security

109
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,840
but i started working and and i mean who

110
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
doesn't want to break things so it was

111
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
to me was awesome

112
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
and uh quickly i got into actually

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,400
leading projects and i never went back

114
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,639
to software engineering because it was

115
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,160
that great at least like in very

116
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,120
beginning was exciting but then that's

117
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,520
why i stayed i want to really make sure

118
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,600
to emphasize this

119
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,560
so as an engineering i mean except

120
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,039
engineering engineers

121
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,960
we build a lot of

122
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,080
software which the main point is to

123
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,440
actually make

124
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,360
our lives better

125
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,160
but

126
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,880
i

127
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,639
actually the reason why i stayed in

128
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,160
security is that

129
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,360
i feel morally obligated to create a

130
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,840
safe and secure application

131
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,720
for example back in the day um i guess

132
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,400
like not everyone was required to

133
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,520
join the

134
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,000
virtual world but now it's actually

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
impossible

136
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,479
impossible for someone to actually exist

137
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,319
without having some sort of account

138
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,240
online so to me that is that is why uh

139
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,319
you know since there is no

140
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,800
other way i guess and it's not going to

141
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,600
be any more a choice moving forward

142
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,800
i feel like we as the professionals we

143
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
are actually morally obligated to create

144
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,680
uh

145
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,600
products that are safe

146
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,160
um okay so um i always like to start my

147
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,400
presentation with what's happening well

148
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,319
it's a lot of things

149
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,560
um i don't know like i i i

150
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,160
at some point i had like

151
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,319
15 things but i just wanted to

152
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,599
um you know like just uh shorted out

153
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,880
but

154
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,759
uh

155
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,800
right now we have increased ransomware

156
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
attack uh we have cyber war actually

157
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,000
it's like in you know we are in the

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,120
middle of that we it's you know a

159
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,039
life example

160
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,840
a cyber war like nation sponsored cyber

161
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,440
war um

162
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,000
we have a lot of

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,960
new i guess like frameworks uh

164
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
technologies such as artificial

165
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,000
intelligence we have autonomous cars we

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
have iots so

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,599
all even or

168
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,599
appliances at home

169
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,560
they are powered by an application or

170
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,520
some sort so basically even or fridge

171
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,879
can be hacked

172
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,199
i mean i don't know like uh

173
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,639
then we have cr blockchain um where

174
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,639
someone tried to mine

175
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,960
and you don't even know that

176
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,639
um so

177
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,560
overall there are a lot of things going

178
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,000
on and so

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
as a cyber security engineer you always

180
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,000
have to know what is happening because

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,759
you know that's your kind of if you

182
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,199
don't know what is happening then you

183
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,759
probably will are missing something

184
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,840
so i just you know um

185
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,080
took a screenshot this is uh one of the

186
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,759
microsoft live uh threats attacks that

187
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,280
are happening in the world

188
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,080
it is assumed or like a hit it perceived

189
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,319
or ave within average in 2022 there are

190
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,680
one ransomware attack for every level

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,200
so it means that you know while i'm

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
talking i don't know how many attacks

193
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,519
are happening right now so

194
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,559
so definitely the situation is not i

195
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,320
guess like it's not going to get better

196
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,360
because as much more we get devices and

197
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,000
things online or powered by applications

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,560
this thing is going to get worse because

199
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,920
the attack surface is just increasing

200
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,399
okay so motivations

201
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,720
the major one is financial but there are

202
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,680
also political ideology and emotion so

203
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,320
political and ideology for example

204
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,000
hacktivism

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,440
emotion

206
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,000
sad to say but you know stacking or

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
slacking or

208
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,680
um i don't know

209
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,399
child product pornography so those are

210
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,720
things that actually trigger me that you

211
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,399
know we need to create a safe

212
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,959
environment for even for our future

213
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,839
um

214
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,839
so with that

215
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,920
a lot of companies have actually

216
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,959
embraced zero trust model what xero

217
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,600
trust says that you you have to assume

218
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,839
that you're already breached everything

219
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,680
you know everything that

220
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,080
regardless of where the request comes

221
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
you cannot assume that just because an

222
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,839
application is behind a firewall that is

223
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,399
safe so you always trust but verify

224
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,680
uh so in particular this is how the

225
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
product will work

226
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,760
basically it's like the intended feature

227
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,079
and actual functionality will match but

228
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,440
you know we don't

229
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,519
live in a perfect world we live in a

230
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,440
real world so

231
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,279
in general when you're building a

232
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,800
product

233
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,920
that is the intended functionality

234
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,360
the red side is actual functionality and

235
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,440
you know your intent or the future is

236
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,079
right here but we always

237
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,800
not intentionally create also security

238
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
vulnerabilities

239
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
and of course product blocks

240
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,000
and this is the side where we actually

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
are concerned

242
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,519
so

243
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,200
today actually i'm gonna

244
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,279
mostly concentrate on talking about

245
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,560
threat modeling

246
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,000
so um there is a fancy definition of

247
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,680
what this modeling is

248
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,720
but you know in general we humans threat

249
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,600
model every time we make a decision

250
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,360
for example

251
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,079
i decided to do a skydiving a couple of

252
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,320
years ago i did try modeling and i just

253
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,760
assumed the risk

254
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,880
so we do actually do threat but it is

255
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,600
just you know another way for us

256
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,680
uh in security to

257
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,480
um identify or call this process

258
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,800
um i like this um

259
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,440
definition or kind of like the it sums

260
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
up real well

261
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,279
threat modeling is kind of a big picture

262
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,000
of security you don't look at the trees

263
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
you look at the forest

264
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,480
um

265
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,079
so basically you kind of zoom out

266
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,560
and look at the your application your

267
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,920
architecture from a little bit higher

268
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,440
um so why we use threat modeling so in

269
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,480
general

270
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
there are technical vulnerabilities and

271
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,519
logical flaws or vulnerabilities

272
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,079
so for example that is you know it just

273
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,519
won't present them

274
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,760
but this is like a logical flaw i don't

275
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,000
think that that is actually safe

276
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,120
um so we are humans and humans design

277
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
products and we actually sometimes make

278
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,519
mistakes so that is like the logical

279
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,040
flaw

280
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,279
um so but people ask like

281
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,200
are we going to just stop doing like

282
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,760
static analysis or that economic

283
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,120
analysis pen testing no that is not the

284
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
you know the point of threat modeling

285
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,000
these are all also required but threat

286
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
modeling is

287
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,399
um okay so you see like logical

288
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,120
vulnerabilities are usually caused by

289
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,040
threat modeling because

290
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
in order to threat model you actually

291
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,120
have to understand the product you have

292
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,440
to understand the business requirements

293
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,200
which most of the scanners don't know

294
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,040
for example if you are building like a

295
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,120
brand new idea that never existed

296
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,839
like normal scanners will not be able to

297
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,079
actually detect anything so

298
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,760
that is the reason why you have to

299
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,240
threat model um and of course like

300
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,920
technical vulnerabilities most of them

301
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,480
are caught by you know static and manual

302
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,839
analysis analysis analysis sorry pen

303
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,279
testing and dynamic code analysis

304
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,519
so when to thread model

305
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,120
so usually so

306
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,079
because i was a software engineer i feel

307
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,160
empathy and i actually empathize with

308
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,240
software engineers too

309
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,079
so you want to actually do the threat

310
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,600
modeling right here

311
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,440
because uh in this phase the tech lead

312
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
know already what to do you know what

313
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,800
they want and how they are going to

314
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
implement it so you already have them

315
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,200
enough material to actually threat model

316
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,720
so usually it's

317
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,839
they you know kind of like the preferred

318
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,600
phase on the sdlc is on the design phase

319
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,160
because also

320
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,120
so

321
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,680
if you i guess like if you don't really

322
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,320
engage security at all and you actually

323
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,199
you

324
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,040
just push the whatever feature of the

325
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,800
product in production what's going to

326
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,600
happen is that you find issues

327
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,959
vulnerabilities and then you're going to

328
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,880
go back and fix them and you know what

329
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,959
happened when you fix them for example

330
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,279
like imagine if your

331
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,079
whatever design

332
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,079
and you have to redesign the whole

333
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,320
product just to actually make sure that

334
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,480
the vulnerability is gone so

335
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,600
it costs it actually cut costs and the

336
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,160
other thing that happens is that

337
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,839
you want to build your product with

338
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,959
security in mind because it's it you

339
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,040
know i said also that

340
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,600
secure you know we are obligated and you

341
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
know there are also laws to actually

342
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,160
build secure software

343
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,959
um

344
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,800
of course it's not wrong if you do it in

345
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,959
the end of the you know if even if the

346
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,399
product is mature

347
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,160
it is you know you are

348
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,639
you're allowed there is no rules but

349
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,920
this is where you get the best benefits

350
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,279
um so

351
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,360
there are like two types of threat

352
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,320
modeling

353
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,160
i used to be a consultant so i would

354
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,199
work for

355
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,240
uh different projects every maybe two

356
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,399
months so i would do like threat from

357
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,399
waterfall threat modeling basically they

358
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,519
i will already have the entire project

359
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,839
i will write i mean for example

360
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,399
sometimes i had thousands of services to

361
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,880
actual threat model the drawback is it

362
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,279
takes forever the other thing that you

363
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,079
you compile a 100 100 page

364
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,240
probably report but then are you

365
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,720
effective because as i said then you

366
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,199
kind of are similar you are doing the

367
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,279
same thing as

368
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,160
static analysis and neck analysis so

369
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,839
they you are not really

370
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,279
benefiting from the

371
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,600
the i guess like the the point behind

372
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,320
threat modeling so in agile world what

373
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
happens is usually you want to partner

374
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,079
with your engineering team and you want

375
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,160
to move along with them because that's

376
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,839
where like

377
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,279
i don't know like i've worked with so

378
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,000
many companies so i know like how um

379
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,079
different flavors and where

380
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
the security stand but generally you

381
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,639
want security to actually be part of

382
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,959
engineering team so whenever they build

383
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,880
something the security engineer is there

384
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,199
of course i am aware security team is

385
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,680
small so i know that we are never going

386
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,320
to have like the you know one-to-one

387
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,079
uh per engineer like a number of

388
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,000
security engineers but of course you

389
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,519
want to embed yourself you can also

390
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,839
automate some of the parts but you know

391
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,519
the important thing is you actually want

392
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,079
to engage with them in early you know

393
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,279
stages and also move along with it so

394
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,360
you are not also the blocker no one

395
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,160
wants to be blocking features

396
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,600
uh type of modeling or methods another

397
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,959
thing is

398
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,560
i so i talk

399
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,639
i have you know i've met a lot of people

400
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,160
but

401
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,320
the problem is that some people

402
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
like processes and they don't

403
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,720
necessarily look at their

404
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,560
organization what they're doing or

405
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,320
anything they just want to embed

406
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,839
processes because of

407
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,600
heck of the process

408
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,920
but that is not the point you have to

409
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,720
assess your own you know organization

410
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,959
you have to know how the things work

411
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,600
imagine like if you just want to do it

412
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,920
because you read it somewhere that's not

413
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,680
like the point the point is that you

414
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,839
have to understand your organization and

415
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,040
embed the parts or pieces of the process

416
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,079
within it but never like sacrifice the

417
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,039
entire

418
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,280
product or the entire

419
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,199
i don't know like entire organization

420
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,199
because you think that you have to go

421
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,000
for each step of the process so you work

422
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,319
with threat modeling as it works for

423
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,240
your organization

424
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,839
um so types is the arthritis pasta kill

425
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,240
chain attack trees personal and grada

426
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,079
those are all the types but i actually

427
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,400
going to talk about stride

428
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,000
um so tools that you can use

429
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,880
of course microsoft no uh there are a

430
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,640
lot of tools actually i use visual

431
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,400
because i like to be in control of what

432
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,600
i'm drawing and how i'm drawing and

433
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,480
everything

434
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,080
um so

435
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,400
it doesn't even matter you can actually

436
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
use a white board because why not but

437
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,480
the problem with whiteboard though is

438
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,000
that you take pictures but you cannot

439
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,559
edit anymore so thread modeling actually

440
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,840
also it's meant to be a living

441
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,280
document or

442
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,679
i don't know like you can you can record

443
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,640
that in a document or so but it's to be

444
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,799
like a living thing so whenever you're

445
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,320
building a feature you're just built on

446
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,400
top of it not necessarily

447
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,240
redraw everything

448
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,720
um so um do it work or like perform

449
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,880
through modeling as it works for you

450
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
but definitely it's good to have

451
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,000
something that you can edit so then you

452
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,160
don't have to redo the whole thing

453
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,640
um so there are four questions that we

454
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,720
generally try to answer during this

455
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,760
process

456
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,160
um what are we working on

457
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
what can go wrong

458
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,720
what are we going to do about it did we

459
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,880
do a good job so these are the four

460
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,760
questions i mean definitely look like

461
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,039
kind of easy but the threat modeling

462
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,120
is actually really abstract thing

463
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,200
because you're trying to

464
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
actually think about threats that can

465
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,760
happen to your product without even

466
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
having the code of course a lot of

467
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,120
brainpower but

468
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,520
i love that because it's just

469
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,200
it's just like

470
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,400
your imagination is the limit

471
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,520
so

472
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,360
what are you working on

473
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,960
get familiar with

474
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,440
application software

475
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,960
it is hard for

476
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,880
it's hard for you to threat model if you

477
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,400
don't understand the nature of the

478
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,240
product this is the reason why i said

479
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,679
that you cannot necessarily use

480
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,840
automated tool because

481
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,160
if you don't know what the project or

482
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,039
the product is doing you cannot

483
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,840
effectively threat model so get familiar

484
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,880
with the software know exactly not just

485
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,039
like know what is doing where

486
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,120
where are the you know services deployed

487
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,640
how they work together how they talk

488
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,679
together

489
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,919
have that knowledge so then you don't

490
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,080
assume anything so insecure

491
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,480
assumption is really not the

492
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,840
uh best i guess like the best thing for

493
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,440
insecurity uh the other thing is engage

494
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,840
with the right people of course what are

495
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,240
all the right people i actually love to

496
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,039
talk or work with tech leads because

497
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,559
they have the right amount of

498
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,400
information that i need to actually do

499
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,360
my my work um

500
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,960
set goals of course um this is like what

501
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,400
are you trying to thread model you

502
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,679
cannot like just

503
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,280
um

504
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,520
because i don't know if you understand

505
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,320
the

506
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,440
scope creep um it's in pms world but you

507
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,679
can actually go so much like further and

508
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,919
like lose track of what you're doing so

509
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,240
setting goal scheduled scope is really

510
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,280
important

511
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,440
uh otherwise you know assessment of

512
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
scope so

513
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,679
uh if you're working on an agile

514
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,280
environment you just

515
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,799
threat model the actual piece that is

516
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,400
changing because you're already done

517
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,240
assumption is already done the rest of

518
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,280
it so you don't want to redo anything

519
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,640
um okay so what can go wrong so break

520
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,280
down this system you know

521
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,679
what are like the pieces of the entire

522
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,039
you know if you're working on future

523
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,600
what services are being changed what is

524
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,080
changing because um just because the

525
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,840
feature

526
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,280
before and then now you're working on

527
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,360
something else and adding things doesn't

528
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
mean that that feature actually actually

529
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,640
it's not has not been impacted so break

530
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,080
down the system make make sure you

531
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,440
understand what

532
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
is happening

533
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,120
in the defy threat agents and possible

534
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,720
attacks

535
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,360
so in this point it's it's really

536
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,600
important because again assumptions

537
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,480
um

538
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,720
some people think that you know the only

539
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,320
you know at

540
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,679
threat agents are the non-users also who

541
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,120
don't have account

542
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,880
those who i don't know

543
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,679
malicious is sometimes really abstract

544
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,320
it actually is among people so

545
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,480
your threat agents are

546
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,559
users known users

547
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,919
internal

548
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,400
even software engineers you as i said

549
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,360
zero trust means that you only you know

550
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,159
you trust but verify so even for your

551
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,880
own organization it depends like how big

552
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,120
it is but you always have to you know

553
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
make sure that you identify the right

554
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,440
agents threat agents because

555
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,360
um you don't want the

556
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,400
you know like

557
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,000
if you don't then things going to go

558
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,240
silent you are not even

559
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,840
you are not going to be able to actually

560
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,919
identify know that you're being attacked

561
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,600
or you know like you lost maybe like a

562
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,000
lot of information but you never knew

563
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,520
uh

564
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,159
and understand the existing contra

565
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,799
measures so of course as i said you know

566
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,400
you don't want to reinvent the wheel

567
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
also you don't want like to be that

568
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,880
person that always complains and you

569
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,280
know but doesn't have the

570
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
doesn't have the data to pick it up so

571
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,600
understand the contra matters and you

572
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,559
always be prepared to answer questions

573
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,720
for example because as a security

574
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
engineer of course you're going to spend

575
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,840
time negotiating with people that is it

576
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,840
like you have to be able to understand

577
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,720
and like

578
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,960
align all the

579
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,679
i guess like the business impact and you

580
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,679
know all the you have to understand like

581
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,600
how to actually elaborate what is

582
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,400
happening and how you know bad or good

583
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,240
is a is an issue

584
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,039
um yeah of course like rank valuable

585
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,200
data and resources based on the risk and

586
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,400
the value so not necessary i guess like

587
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
some parts of your application or

588
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,559
product or more valuable have have more

589
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,039
like important data than some other ones

590
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,280
for example like depending i guess like

591
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,559
the question is

592
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,640
what would someone want from you like

593
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,559
what are they what is the gold in your

594
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,200
product what someone would want to take

595
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,280
off so that's like how you think about

596
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,679
when you try to rank the valuable

597
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,360
information

598
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,679
and then of course the the last thing

599
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,440
which is the most important thing

600
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,480
identify exploitable uh vulnerability so

601
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,240
we are going to use stride which is

602
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,520
spoofing

603
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,799
tempering

604
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,000
repudiation information disclosure and

605
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,360
and then i think okay and

606
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,799
elevation of privilege i wasn't sure

607
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,559
what is happening

608
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,640
so spoofing is something you know

609
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,240
something you have something you are

610
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,360
something

611
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,279
somewhere you are location something you

612
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,960
do so these are like the things that

613
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,279
identify a user

614
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,919
and so like with spoofing uh it's you

615
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,159
know pretend to be someone that someone

616
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,440
else

617
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,120
um

618
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,559
so an example would be uh sim swapping

619
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,480
so this involves a little bit of social

620
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,640
engineering but basically it means that

621
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,000
for example

622
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,120
a

623
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,559
it was uh some cryptocurrency investor

624
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,600
or whatever

625
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,679
lost like billions of dollars because

626
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,679
someone called their provider and

627
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,159
pretended they hit them and asked to

628
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,440
send their

629
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,520
cancel the sim card because they lost it

630
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,600
and send a new one

631
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,679
other address so what happened is that

632
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,240
they they lost because of two-factor of

633
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,200
course

634
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,679
and so that guy is poor you know like he

635
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,240
lost a lot of money so another thing i

636
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,559
hope this will work

637
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,720
i wish

638
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,159
it's is it connected to the internet

639
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,720
maybe not

640
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,520
okay i think i can live with it but

641
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,640
basically it's deep still

642
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,279
facial and voice owning this is not like

643
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,840
anymore like a distant thing it is

644
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,520
already happening and there are a lot of

645
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,880
companies

646
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,640
who are investing to actually identify

647
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,400
what is real and what is big um

648
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,240
especially if you're famous and you have

649
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,000
a lot of you know

650
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,080
videos and you have a lot of material

651
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,240
out there chances are you're gonna be

652
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
you know creating like some

653
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,640
uh fake videos are high so that's the

654
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
reason why sometimes i just change my my

655
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,080
my voice

656
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,120
but you know like that's the um i wish

657
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,279
this had worked it's a perfect example

658
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,159
but

659
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,360
or like voice cloning like

660
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,480
take your

661
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,799
voice bits you know put it together and

662
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,799
actually ask let's just say you're you

663
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,960
know really high up ask someone hey i

664
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,880
need all the money send it to me right

665
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,760
now that's it you know like and who who

666
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,440
for example especially like people are

667
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,120
really good at following

668
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,679
instruction in order so

669
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,640
uh

670
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,960
tampering so it's all have to do with

671
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,600
integrity so changing data or uh code

672
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,559
um

673
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,320
look for jay

674
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
uh

675
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,960
because it was like a nightmare of

676
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,880
like christmas nightmare or christmas

677
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,039
gift whatever you want to call it uh or

678
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,400
for example there was a ruby gem that

679
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,200
was

680
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,400
there was a

681
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,679
storm

682
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,440
uh that

683
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
it was a back door that basically

684
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
pretended to be part of your code but it

685
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,679
was not actually um so

686
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,279
another and

687
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,679
the next thing is repeat repudiation so

688
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,679
not reputation so claiming not to do

689
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,200
particular action

690
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,080
um logging things is really important

691
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,320
for auditing or telemetry whatever but

692
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,000
you know making sure that you log every

693
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,760
action that is happening in your product

694
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,520
is important so that also uh making sure

695
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,400
that you

696
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,320
you log properly with

697
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,559
addressing the right people like each

698
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,000
user needs to be identified properly so

699
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,679
when that action happens you know like

700
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,679
you can go back because it's it's

701
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,799
now i think like more than anything

702
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,480
we have a lot of data but we just need

703
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,080
to make sure that we actually use them

704
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,120
properly

705
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,080
so

706
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,440
an example would be when you have one

707
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,039
account

708
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,840
of certain software or whatever and

709
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,080
there are multiple people using it

710
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,080
so when things happen you don't know who

711
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,480
what happened or who did it so that is

712
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
like basically saying i didn't know i

713
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,520
did not do so of course if you if you

714
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,279
you know if you have like only one user

715
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,840
that means that you cannot point out who

716
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,279
did it

717
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,159
uh information disclosure this is really

718
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,520
common uh so basically the leaking or

719
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,320
leakage of sensitive information

720
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,120
an example is eq facts if you remember

721
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,720
this was pretty big deal

722
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,399
a lot of social security numbers were

723
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,320
leaked and then i i don't know like how

724
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,679
still they

725
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,559
i don't want to talk anyway uh but yes

726
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,000
they leaked all the social security

727
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,039
numbers

728
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,360
and uh it's of course like they had like

729
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,760
some programs to you know make sure that

730
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,720
you get like some you know uh protection

731
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
but of course you know once it happened

732
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,080
it happens so

733
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,039
um

734
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,600
denial of service so basically making or

735
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,919
putting down your service um making you

736
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:30,960
know

737
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,039
it it has to do with availability of

738
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,279
your service so if a service let's just

739
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,159
say

740
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,760
um i don't know like

741
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,840
any really important

742
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,640
um

743
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,840
action

744
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,520
goes down it means that you know the

745
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,080
other users cannot log in or for example

746
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,520
if someone stole someone's password and

747
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,880
then just you know brings down the

748
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,480
service then the person cannot like

749
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,720
actually log in change it so therefore

750
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,320
yeah um

751
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,919
but you probably

752
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:56,880
uh

753
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,520
miriah i think i'm pronouncing it right

754
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,440
you you don't probably remember this

755
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,240
when half of the world was in dark

756
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,320
um

757
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,679
and then well the last thing is

758
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,760
elevation of privileges which has to do

759
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,480
with authorization so being able to

760
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,960
perform unauthorized action so

761
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,799
pretending like you're an admin

762
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,840
uh

763
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,919
yeah i

764
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,000
i don't know if i want to tell a story

765
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,080
while i was a consultant but um

766
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,240
basically like elevating privileges

767
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,360
meltdown as a spectre bypass user

768
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,279
application restrictions from accessing

769
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,799
the protected kernel memory so it's like

770
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,960
uh elevating privileges to access

771
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,200
someone who they are not

772
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,679
uh other considerations cryptography

773
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,480
data protection error handling those are

774
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,679
all like

775
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,000
important parts which are not maybe like

776
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,080
part of uh stride but you have to

777
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,120
consider myself when i do a threat model

778
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,799
i don't necessarily follow the rules or

779
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,799
anything i don't have a process it's

780
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,039
just like something it's a muscle that

781
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,960
you build on and so you actually work

782
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,279
more and more in projects

783
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,159
um

784
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,399
and then what are we going to do about

785
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,799
it this is like an this is like when you

786
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,880
close you have to close the loop

787
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,200
um one thing like i said you know

788
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,279
difference between being a consultant

789
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,919
and actually owning a product is that

790
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,080
you have to be really like this is the

791
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,480
hardest part because you know finding

792
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,880
issues maybe it's not easy but it's not

793
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,080
the hard part it's actually implementing

794
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,640
or you know um actually making sure that

795
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,399
those are remediated

796
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,279
um

797
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,640
so prioritize and identify risks

798
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,440
uh

799
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,159
provide remediation mitigation so

800
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,240
when i mentioned you have to be

801
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,760
sympathizing with or

802
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,240
engineers is that you cannot just say

803
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,399
like here's a bug here's a vulnerability

804
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,640
fix it by and you know i will come and

805
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,960
check you you know if you fix it you

806
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,440
have to actually work provide solutions

807
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,880
and of course you know work um you know

808
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,880
negotiating what is the best you know

809
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,279
solution because sometimes you know

810
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,120
let's just say osp says something but

811
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,720
that doesn't work necessarily because

812
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,039
you have some other service it's not

813
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,519
even like the same language so you have

814
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,000
to be able to at least provide a

815
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,960
pseudocode or an example how some like

816
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,440
an issue is can be fixed

817
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,399
uh and add automated tests so

818
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,760
you know if you know that something

819
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
happened before why not automate that

820
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,279
you know make sure that you check

821
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,919
overtime so that that thing has not been

822
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,159
broken since then so add you know

823
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,240
automation to make sure that you

824
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,039
validate things that you want that are

825
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,320
particularly there are things that are

826
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
really important and you know you cannot

827
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,679
like just let it

828
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,080
uh out of the chance

829
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,279
uh the sore meta references um i think i

830
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,799
have all of them

831
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,720
um and this is those this like i try to

832
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,480
make it easy if you want to contact me

833
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,640
or get in touch i'm more than happy to

834
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,039
talk to you i love people i love

835
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,440
security and i love to contribute to

836
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,799
this community because that's how i

837
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,799
actually got into security i don't have

838
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,919
a formal

839
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,320
uh education and security but i actually

840
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,559
learned because i you know i i for some

841
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,200
reason i i was kind of like

842
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,640
assigned to a project but then i loved

843
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,240
it and i just learned by myself

844
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,840
everything that i know

845
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840
um

846
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,120
last thing

847
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,039
definitely like if you're a cyber

848
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,960
security engineer

849
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,000
