6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,360
worked on this project for the last

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,560
eight months and we are extremely

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,400
excited to be here and represent our

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,520

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,560
so everything that we're going to be

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,720
showing you today was gathered and the

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,960
information is actually provided is 100

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,119
legal and if you do end up going and

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,880
engaging with any scammers if they're

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,480
illegal means you were doing so at your

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,159
own risk

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,160
awesome here we have some statistics of

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
the most common scams scamming is an

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,879
ever-growing epidemic and

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,040
that affects the society in multiple

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,640
ways and the more that it spreads in the

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,399
society the more it becomes

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,760
sophisticated

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,360
um the total loss reported in 2021 uh

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,640
globally was 43.1 billion euros which is

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,719
a very significant amount

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,520
and

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
unfortunately scams do not impact

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,760
society only in a financial manner but

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,280
also and they also cause a

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,560
emotional mental and physical harm

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,760
the

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,200
way the channels the different channels

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,119
through which these scans are delivered

35
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,080
very through text message email

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,240
emails as well as

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,720
phone calls or fake websites

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,200
we truly believe that

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,960
the problem must be tackled in where it

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,920
starts and in most cases is online the

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,600
goal of this project is to gather

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,520
actionable intelligence so that we can

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,920
report these scammers the way we achieve

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,000
this is by doing scam baiting and that

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,799
is the process of calling up scammers um

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,640
acting to be a victim so that we can so

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
that we can waste their times

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
there's already a lot of individuals and

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,840
communities that do this on their own

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,960
free time

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
on different platforms such as reddit

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,560
youtube twitch or bob rtc but what makes

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,040
us different well we've been using

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,640
different techniques that go beyond scan

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,799
baiting by using social engineering

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,479
using phishing we

57
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,159
and then as well as using open source

58
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,799
intelligence for osin we've been getting

59
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,520
a lot of information um on scammers as

60
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
well as um initiating some

61
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,758
investigations we've been investigating

62
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,680
their identities

63
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,720
websites phone numbers as well as

64
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,200
tracking it down to specific individuals

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,160
the overall goal is goal is obviously to

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,720
bring down these scammers now one of the

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,959
main things that makes us different is

68
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,120
um increasing and spreading awareness in

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,599
the community such as this

70
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,680
uh we coming to conferences like this

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
gives us the opportunity to introduce

72
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,480
the uh the concept of scam beating to

73
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,800
individuals like you that with the

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,480
potential that you may want to join the

75
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,400
cause

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
now before we actually are able to

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
conduct any call we need to go through

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,200
some preparation steps

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,959
and if you want to

80
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,319
in a previous talk we went into this

81
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,560
topic a much more in depth at cactus con

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,920
so if you'd like you can go online and

83
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,599
visit that but here i'll be going over a

84
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,840
very brief overview of kind of how we

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,159
prepare before going into a scam call so

86
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,480
the very first step is to find what scam

87
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,959
we want to go in and try to scam bait

88
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,000
and we do

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,480
do so through a variety of resources one

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,680
of which is

91
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,720
the subreddit r scam scam numbers which

92
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,200
posts frequently active scammer numbers

93
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,680
that you can call and try to engage with

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,120
additionally there is scam baiting

95
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,519
specific resources scammer.info and bob

96
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,280
rtc in which additionally post

97
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,400
information and phone numbers as well as

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
additional information that we can use

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,159
to assist in preparing for an actual

100
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,200
scam

101
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,879
once we've picked the actual scam that

102
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,799
we want to do we can then go and start

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,680
to prepare our victim persona and at

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,200
this stage it's really important to

105
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,599
prepare information that is relevant and

106
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,680
actually verifiable as anything that we

107
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,000
create it's very easy for scammers to

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,680
kind of verify any information or

109
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,360
numbers that we give such as credit card

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,519
or social security numbers

111
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,120
now throughout this entire process we

112
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
want to make sure that we ourselves as

113
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,680
secure

114
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
we are dealing with real bad actors who

115
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,200
are actively committing crimes so we

116
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,599
need to separate ourselves as far away

117
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,400
as from these scammers as possible and

118
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,879
we do so through the usage of a vpn and

119
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,120
a vm the vpn allows us to separate

120
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,959
ourselves geographically and the vm

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,200
keeps us secure and for any online

122
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
interactions in a very in a nice

123
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,279
sandboxed environment

124
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,358
additionally if we are working with any

125
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,120
scams that require a remote screen

126
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,080
takeover we have a separate honeypots

127
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,479
laptop dedicated just to this project so

128
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,000
we don't have to worry about any

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,680
malicious uh

130
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
any malicious content being uploaded to

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
our personal computers

132
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
now at this point with everything

133
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,160
prepared we're ready to actually make

134
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,639
the call and where our team is unique is

135
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,240
while there's only one person contacting

136
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
the scammer at a time we have an entire

137
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,919
team behind us that is actively

138
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,560
researching and taking notes to make

139
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,400
sure this process goes as smoothly as

140
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,240
possible

141
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,840
now that we have explained the setup and

142
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
how that all works we're going to talk

143
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,240
about what kind of scans we target now

144
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
we mainly focus on um scams with the

145
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,520
small scale operations meaning that we

146
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,360
don't go for the scams that are um that

147
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
are causing millions of dollars in

148
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
losses we're focusing on the small ones

149
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,400
why because they don't get a lot of

150
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,080
attention from government agencies

151
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
because of the small amounts that they

152
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,039
that they cause for example some

153
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,320
scammers

154
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,759
reach out to people asking for small

155
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,199
amounts because that doesn't usually

156
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,840
raise a lot of suspicion so they

157
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,240
are successful with their scams although

158
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,039
the amounts are small they are

159
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,680
they're usually committing a lot of

160
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,840
they're usually calling a lot of people

161
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,080
so that they can make profits so this

162
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,880
most likely affects a lot of people

163
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,919
um now yeah that is one of the motives

164
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,320
for our project because these scams are

165
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,400
just being let go the governments do not

166
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,320
really pay attention to them

167
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,400
some of the main scam types that we've

168
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,320
been looking um that we've been focusing

169
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,759
on recently are the ones that are

170
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,759
trending which are

171
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,319
crypto or forex scams sales and tech

172
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,680
support

173
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,280
my favorite part about dealing with tech

174
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,800
support is that we get to deal with

175
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
scammers that give us some answers that

176
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,880
we know are wrong and we get to see what

177
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,199
that looks like and kind of a

178
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,960
demonstration we're going to play a

179
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,800
recording from one of our uh scan

180
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,720
baiting sessions

181
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
this is all the infection which is

182
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,400
running inside here

183
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,520
oh

184
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,639
no

185
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,090
that

186
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,159
[Music]

187
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,960
[Music]

188
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
and that is something is

189
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,758
really critical

190
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,039
uh

191
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,960
oh okay what

192
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,980
uh so what's the name of this malware

193
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,479
[Music]

194
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,280
the malware

195
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,400
and on top of that i don't know if

196
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,479
you're able to see but the malicious

197
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,039
attackers that were attacking our system

198
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,000
was the windows event logger

199
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,120
so

200
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,319
now you've seen a little bit of the kind

201
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,840
of the kind of scammers that we're

202
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
interacting with let's talk about how we

203
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,520
can actually manipulate them into giving

204
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,919
us the information that we want now the

205
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,520
big the easiest way to keep scammers

206
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,960
trick scammers and giving us information

207
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,800
is just to keep them talking the more

208
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,080
they talk the more likely they're going

209
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
to share something that we can use to

210
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,360
trace them individually or the scammer

211
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
operation as a whole however keeping

212
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,440
them talking isn't enough we also need

213
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,440
to keep them engaged and one of the best

214
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,680
ways that we've found to do this is by

215
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,319
not making them angry a method often

216
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,000
used by other scam beaters is to try

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,759
their best to make them angry as they

218
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,199
will lose track of time and waste a

219
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,759
whole lot of it but for our goal of

220
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,360
keeping the and for of trying to get as

221
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,000
much information out as we can once we

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,280
reveal that we're not a legitimate

223
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,599
victim we lose the opportunity to use

224
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,680
that to our advantage so trying to keep

225
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,759
them as happy and

226
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,160
calm as possible really is the best way

227
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,720
for us to do it additionally making sure

228
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,479
that we do our best to act like a real

229
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,639
victim likely if you've ever engaged

230
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,160
with the scammer it wasn't a pleasant

231
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,759
experience whether you were annoyed

232
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,400
unhappy or angry using those negative

233
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,599
emotions as an acting practice against

234
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,080
these scammers make us less suspicious

235
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,759
and makes us more believable as an

236
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,759
actual victim now like i was mentioning

237
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,199
earlier all the information that we

238
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,639
provide credit card number social

239
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,560
security numbers it's very easy for

240
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,720
scammers to pull up a quick online tool

241
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,639
that verifies this information

242
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,319
so we need to make sure that anything we

243
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,280
provide them is 100 verifiable so we can

244
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,440
get as far into the scam as possible and

245
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,519
learn as much about the operation as we

246
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,320
can

247
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,399
now while a lot of what i'm saying is

248
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,919
talking about making sure we're planning

249
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,839
and preparing in advance another key

250
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,399
skill set to have is improvising there's

251
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,600
always going to be something that you're

252
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
not able to prepare for or a question

253
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,800
that you didn't think to prepare for so

254
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,560
making sure that you can have the skill

255
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
of using it to your advantage as it

256
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,880
comes up is very very helpful and to

257
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,399
kind of emphasize this

258
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,160
we're going to show you a clip of what

259
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,360
happens oftentimes one of our teammates

260
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,120
is mistaken for having a girl's voice so

261
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,200
instead of taking the time to

262
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,880
explain and try to correct the scammer

263
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
we try to use it to our advantage and

264
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160

all right so one of the main uh one of

296
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,160
the main goals of social engineering is

297
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,240
to kind of get some kind of

298
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,160
some kind of information from the

299
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,040
scammers uh ideally some kind of contact

300
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,279
phone number or email address so that we

301
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,720
can create that point of contact with

302
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,320
them in case we need to send them a

303
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,160
malicious link to obtain information

304
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
from them in this case we've been using

305
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,800
grabifyip logger to craft some uh to

306
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,079
craft the link and send that to the

307
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,519
scammers the goal is for them to click

308
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,560
on it so that we can get more

309
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
information we've been redirecting them

310
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,880
to a completely normal looking website

311
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,640
and once they click on it they will get

312
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,720
to the normal website without suspecting

313
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,399
that we're stealing any information from

314
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,800
them but once they click on it this is

315
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,320
what we look on the next what this is

316
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,760
what we see on the next screen the

317
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
advanced log shows a lot of information

318
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
such as ip address

319
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,519
operating system machine location time

320
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,279
zone and a bunch of other information

321
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,800
now all of this is very useful because

322
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,120
it gives us the opportunity to get a lot

323
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,959
of pivot points so that we can continue

324
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,079
on with our investigations

325
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,600

right so now comes the payment part so

353
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,519
uh we tried to process the payment with

354
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,680
the car details you gave us sir but

355
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,079
somehow it's getting declined so did you

356
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,959
like receive any uh notification from

357
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,720
your bank to approve the payment service

358
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,560
yeah so what do you want from my uh so

359
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,200
my bank portal gives me a link let me um

360
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,040
i can i can spell out the link for you

361
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,320
it's uh https

362
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,160
let me try and enter it

363
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,399
so the link did not work it took me you

364
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,760
to uh

365
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,279
oh

366
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,600
a bad website i could say

367
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,760
yeah it took me to a dating website so

368
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,040
so like maggie said we can choose any

369
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,279
site that this link redirects to so what

370
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,480
did the scammers see when they clicked

371
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,519
on the bad website farmers only dot com

372
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,480
a dating site for farmers

373
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
so while we do really have a lot of fun

374
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,399
with this we need to remember our

375
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,160
primary goal here of gathering

376
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,079
actionable intelligence on these scammer

377
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,360
operations

378
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,959
on the phone it's very hard to gather

379
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,240
that level of intelligence and

380
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,519
oftentimes the information that we

381
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,600
gather is only able to allow us to

382
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,839
figure out if the scam is real or not if

383
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,600
they are in fact committing an illegal

384
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,240
crime and if the scam is worth our time

385
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
and resources as university students in

386
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,839
investigating

387
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,639
now

388
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,760
the reason that we bring up this

389
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,199
actionable intelligence and keep

390
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,360
reiterating it is because like maggie

391
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,760
was saying earlier businesses and

392
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,440
government agencies really don't have

393
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,120
the time and resources to focus on

394
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,560
something that's more small scale like

395
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,240
this so if we are going to be

396
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,760
investigating on their behalf and then

397
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,519
submitting them information it needs to

398
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,079
be something that is verifiable accurate

399
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,839
and information they can

400
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,880
that they can immediately use to go and

401
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,040
try and take down these scammers

402
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,399
and this kind of information can take

403
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,920
all different types of form depending on

404
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,000
which scam it is it can be websites it

405
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,399
can be names it can be locations

406
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,160
and it's very hard to kind of figure out

407
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,720
until we begin an in-depth investigation

408
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,959
but to show just how bad this

409
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,560
information can be against the scammers

410
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,839
operation we're going to show you

411
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,519
another clip where we were lucky enough

412
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,199
to find the information early on and

413
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,560
actually confront a scammer with it to

414
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,800
see their reaction

415
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,639
hi my name is also warranty so there

416
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,440
would be a one-time technician fee okay

417
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,519
because you don't have warranty

418
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,440
just to make sure you said your name was

419
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,760

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,040
and why are you giving me this address

447
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,160
in ballet

448
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,079
i just checked on internet i found that

449
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,120
that is not in us it's in

450
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,880
uh india

451
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,800
i am fully aware of that sean

452
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,639
as we see here the name that they gave

453
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,160
us is different from the name that we

454
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,839
asked them in double checked because we

455
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,120
found that through different ways and

456
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
not from what they told us

457
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,720
while calling them wasting their time

458
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,800
and getting more information is a very

459
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,040
great start we uh to make an actual

460
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,120
difference we need to um conduct an

461
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,959
investigation one of the most recent

462
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,279
investigations was a crypto or forex

463
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,240
scam that we um recently researched it

464
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
actually started back in january of this

465
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,639
year where we found through instagram

466
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,560
actually we saw some different accounts

467
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,199
posting very similar posts advertising

468
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,600
and say claiming that their personal

469
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800
um

470
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,959
personal advisor was

471
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,559
guaranteeing a 1 000

472
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,199
return on investment on any amount with

473
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,319
a minimum of 500 uh dollar investment

474
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,280
so it's a very large amount um for for

475
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,400
crypto

476
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,359
now

477
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,720
on top of that they were saying that the

478
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,240
only cost was a 10

479
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,480
uh 10 fee that they would have to pay

480
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,240
and then uh they would get that within

481
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,319
24 hours it is definitely too good to be

482
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,240
true and as we all know not only that um

483
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,559
crypto and forex are not guaranteed or a

484
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,840
return on investment of any uh of any

485
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,679
amount but also

486
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,280
um that

487
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,760
is very fast in a large amount that is

488
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,360
not always guaranteed so we um we

489
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,200
immediately found uh that that was a

490
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,840
scam we found only two uh so far

491
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,200
accounts that were related to the scam

492
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,880
katie official 12 and katie official

493
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,200
backup page um any time that we

494
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,559
interacted with these accounts we

495
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,880
created some um

496
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,440
sock puppet accounts um just to stay

497
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,280
anonymous at all times

498
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,720
the these scammers are targeting um

499
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,200
middle-aged or young adults that are not

500
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,880
very familiar with the technology they

501
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,200
do not know how crypto and forex works

502
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,240
very well

503
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,039
um

504
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,000
now

505
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
one of the other things that they're

506
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,799
doing one of their techniques is that

507
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,760
they take

508
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,840
over the accounts of the victims after

509
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,360
they have gotten money from them they

510
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
hack those accounts and they start

511
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,840
posting on their behalf so that their um

512
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,520
their network starts finding out and

513
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,440
investing as well

514
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,280
after that they rename the accounts

515
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
which we suspect is for identifying

516
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,120
purposes um for each account that they

517
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
hack moving on to the next one on the

518
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,960
investigation

519
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,880
in addition to committing financial

520
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
fraud

521
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,799
hacking instagram accounts this person

522
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,440
is also committing identity theft why

523
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,280
because once we carefully saw their

524
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,799
profile there's this picture that they

525
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,919
posted that has a tag a location tag in

526
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,240
miami florida but looking carefully in

527
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,559
the background we see a poster that is

528
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,960
not in english so we researched that a

529
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,400
little further and looked it up and it

530
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,440
was related to a event happening in

531
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,679
rotterdam netherlands so that was the

532
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,440
first mismatch in the first discrepancy

533
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,760
that we found next the date of the uh

534
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,360
that the picture was posted and the date

535
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,799
of the event were completely different

536
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,960
so that was the second indicator that

537
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,360
this is a scam of course the main the

538
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,200
main purpose is to find the scam and

539
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,120
report them however we wanted to also

540
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,720
make sure to find the identity that

541
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,120
victim and let them know we started

542
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,200
doing some further investigation and

543
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,600
some reverse image searching and we

544
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,440
found an exact match of pictures that

545
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
the scammer was using to another account

546
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
with a lot of followers that is running

547
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,360
a legit business we made sure to contact

548
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,640
her and let her know that somebody's

549
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,400
using her content and pictures without

550
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,760
her permission

551
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,640
so that that went pretty well um and

552
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,160
then in addition to that we also

553
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,640
condense all these findings um into a

554
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,880
report and submit it to the fbi cyber

555
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,960
crime unit

556
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,039
so another scam that we took the time to

557
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,400
investigate that's very different from

558
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,039
the previous one is a sales scam so the

559
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,280
way that this scam worked was initially

560
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,440
a user would be sent a text message from

561
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,000
a random number that has a website link

562
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,679
in there as you can see in the top left

563
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,880
if you click on this link it would

564
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
redirect you to a promotional website

565
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,360
that would be either explaining a

566
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,960
product that doesn't actually exist or

567
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,520
providing you with a free prize that you

568
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,039
have now won as you can kind of see over

569
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,039
here now if you click anywhere on that

570
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,120
site it will redirect you to a third and

571
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,440
final site which will ask you for your

572
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,760
address to ship the product to and your

573
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,440
credit card information to pay for the

574
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,679
very small shipping fee for your pre

575
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,400
free product as can be seen down here

576
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,720
now this is actually the biggest scam

577
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,960
that we've investigated it's it covers

578
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
over 60 different websites and over a

579
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,159
dozen different phone numbers so all the

580
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,320
information here that we need is very

581
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,679
hard to keep track of and we needed to

582
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,960
make sure that we had a tool that was

583
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
able to keep track of everything and

584
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,000
keep it up to the same level of

585
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,360
integrity that we're using in the

586
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,600
previous kind of smaller investigations

587
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,120
so the tool that we used is something

588
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,720
called multego and if you're not

589
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,400
familiar with it multego is a data

590
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,919
visualization tool used for

591
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,240
investigations that allows you to map

592
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,559
out different pieces of information and

593
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,400
link them together explaining how

594
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,720
everything is connected and as you can

595
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,799
see in the bottom left that is the end

596
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,039
result of our multego graph

597
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,039
of the entire scammer operation which

598
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,960
eats with each one of those circles

599
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,400
representing some kind of piece of

600
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,240
information whether it be a website an

601
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,480
email or phone number and if you zoom in

602
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,760
on any part of this graph you get

603
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,440
something that looks like this where you

604
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,679
have a lot more detail showing any notes

605
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,960
or files that we've attached

606
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,039
additionally showing specifically what

607
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,120
these what is the link between all these

608
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,960
different connections

609
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,000
now being that there's so much

610
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,760
information here we took the time to go

611
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
through and use a bunch of tools online

612
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,679
such as who is searching and reverse dns

613
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,320
lookups as well as doing a forensics

614
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
investigation into the html and

615
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
javascript on all of these websites and

616
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,400
what we were able to find is a whole lot

617
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,720
of information biggest one of which was

618
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
an api key

619
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,640
for a custom api tool that the scanners

620
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,720
are using across most of these websites

621
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,159
in order to make everything run a lot

622
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,240
simpler and we worked on abusing that as

623
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,480
well as in one of the whois searches we

624
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,400
were actually able to catch one of their

625
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,159
slip-ups where they forgot to mark a

626
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,320
privacy setting in the who is registry

627
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,120
so we have an actual name address and

628
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
contact information of someone who we

629
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,559
believe to be heavily involved in the

630
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,559
scammer operation now currently we're

631
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,320
still working on the report for this

632
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,640
with uh for this specific investigation

633
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,559
but in the meantime every single website

634
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,240
that comes up we are reporting to search

635
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,720
engines such as google in order to block

636
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,320
these websites and eventually take them

637
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,720
down so that further victims are not

638
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,799
stolen do not get their money stolen

639
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,250
and that's a wrap thank you everyone

640
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,930
[Applause]

641
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,720
