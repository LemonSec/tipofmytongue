1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,600
good afternoon everyone um i gave my

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,920
presentation a fancy title but i promise

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,160
i'm gonna talk more about cyber then i'm

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,480
gonna talk about money but my talk is

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,119
gonna be about transformer

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,480
briefly about me i'm a local guy i grew

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,160
up i spent most of my life here in

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,439
pristina

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,439
and then moved to norway

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,920
six seven years ago i have a bachelor's

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,080
from university of pristina here

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,159
computer engineer by background

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,079
and then specialized in cyber security

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,600
have a master's in

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,000
information security

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,079
i have more than five years of work and

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,200
experience

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,680
i started as a software developer and

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,480
then slowly move to move to security

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,600
i'm a consultant in kpmg which means

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,840
we do a lot of things within security

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,320
but i specialize in incident response

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,480
and threat intelligence

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,079
i'm going to explain briefly what they

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,960
mean

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,480
later on but uh

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,559
if you see me at the company

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,879
usually it's either too too good or too

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,960
bad it's either a positive news or a

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,320
negative news there

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,880
there is no neutral in between

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,240
so either the company is doing really

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,400
good and trying to be proactive or the

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,080
company has been hacked

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,520
um

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,600
how to reach out to me i'm on

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,920
almost every social media out there but

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,799
professionally i i like linting so if

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,320
you want to reach out let's be friends

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,759
on linkedin and we can learn a lot from

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,079
each other

42
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,079
i want to start my presentation by by

43
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,720
this famous quote from one of the

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,880
greek philosophers that says

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,159
the only constant in life is change uh

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,960
and this this is very much true about

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,880
all the fields of technology but also

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,360
true about cyber security uh we are

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,200
living in a world where uh things are

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,399
changing a lot they're changing

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,880
constantly uh things are becoming more

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,159
complex in the very beginning of of

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,079
technology if you will in internet and

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,280
computers

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,920
not that many people if any

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,840
talked about security security was not

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,880
the thing technology was built by having

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,280
functionality as a design so it was a

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,878
tool to

60
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,440
utilize to facilitate our daily life but

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,000
not that many thought about security uh

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,239
as years pass by and as we can see even

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,200
today

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
security cyber security is a really

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
important topic and as we can see with

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,400
the

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,080
events in ukraine also with the panamic

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,160
cyber is something we have to

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,959
take care really carefully

70
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,959
in the beginning we had concepts like

71
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,720
perimeter security and security for

72
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,239
those that i remember which assumed that

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,959
everything within our yard everything we

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,879
found within our house

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,160
is trusted anything else is not and we

76
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,000
try to protect our environment by just

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
assuming that everything inside is is

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,280
trusted uh that worked for some years

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,720
but it doesn't work anymore it's not

80
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,599
effective anymore uh you cannot longer

81
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
just think about ourself where most of

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,920
our data is in the cloud and we have a

83
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,159
little to no control of the cloud we

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,480
cannot think just about to ourselves

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,319
uh when we have

86
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,280
vendor suppliers that we have no control

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,680
simply the situation today is way more

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
complex so we cannot think about

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,599
traditional approaches that's why we had

90
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,120
one of our talks today we have zero

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
trust today and all those advancements

92
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,280
but as things advance so does the threat

93
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,519
actor so that the hackers also advance

94
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,000
so how do we keep up with all these

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,360
changes and make sure that we are

96
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
protected

97
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,400
one of the

98
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,840
ways to do this

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,599
is through the so-called cyber threat

100
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,720
intelligence

101
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,560
which is a field

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
or a domain in cyber security

103
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,200
adopted by the military the intelligence

104
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,599
services you have all seen the the

105
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,400
movies the cia movies so the concept is

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,200
adapted from from there uh it's known

107
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,439
this is a field for quite a long but it

108
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,280
got it momentum around 2008 at 10

109
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,159
after this big chinese operation called

110
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,319
aurora a lot of companies started to

111
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,000
investigate the

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,159
the hack there and started also to share

113
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,319
to share intelligence with the community

114
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,560
and that's when they realized uh wait a

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,680
bit

116
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,280
uh the best intelligence that's the is

117
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,720
the one you get

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,880
after an incident response and not

119
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
something that you'll find in the

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
intelligence agencies somewhere in a

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
safe deposit um

122
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
there's a lot of definition about this

123
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,199
but basically this information which is

124
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,360
process validated and then when it's put

125
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,040
in the right context it's going to help

126
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,240
you to

127
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,320
protect your

128
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,440
harmful from a harmful event

129
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,040
personally i put this slide here because

130
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,759
i'm a huge fan believer of the concept

131
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,600
that is called cyber threat intelligence

132
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,759
informed cyber security services in

133
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,800
general so basically the best defense is

134
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,240
the one that uh

135
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,320
is driven by understanding the threat

136
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,639
actors these these hackers that's the

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,280
best way to do and this can be this can

138
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
be applied to all the fields of cyber

139
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,680
security whether just security training

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,520
that's whether that's risk management

141
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,600
whether that's incident response

142
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,160
detection penetration testing etc so

143
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
everything that is you have all the

144
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
recent updates from from the

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,440
threat textures itself

146
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,320
uh

147
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,600
one of those things that i want to

148
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
update you today is an attack that is

149
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,400
called ransomware i assume most of you

150
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,479
know what transformer is but a briefly

151
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,639
is a piece of software that encrypts

152
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,280
your files and renders them unavailable

153
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
and then it requires a demo demands a

154
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,400
ransom in order to get access back to

155
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,639
the files

156
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,240
as a concept is

157
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,280
by no means new uh it has existed since

158
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,440
at least

159
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,080
1989

160
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,400
when in a conference like this organized

161
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,639
by the world health health organization

162
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,199
one smart guy there decided to

163
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,680
spread ransomware to around 20 000

164
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,880
researchers

165
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,479
via floppy disk

166
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,400
uh we were talking more than 30 years

167
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,560
ago by no means that was no not

168
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,319
sophisticated

169
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,080
for those that are into cryptography

170
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,240
that was uh symmetric encryption easy to

171
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,039
decrypt but yet again this is way

172
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,039
30 something years ago

173
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,840
and uh also the demand for for ransom

174
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,919
was pretty low compared to today it was

175
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,039
around 200 but this is the event

176
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,639
that we use as a starting point for

177
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,759
ransomware

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,479
uh for a period and things were a bit

179
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,800
quiet not that much going on until uh

180
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,759
2010 when

181
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,680
hackers i like to call them threat

182
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,759
actors started using this fire and

183
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,759
forget method which is basically

184
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,319
automate your attack as much as possible

185
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,639
target as many victims as you can and

186
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
maybe some of them will fall

187
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,080
it worked to some degree but yet again

188
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
there was no customization there you

189
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,440
were just trying to target all the

190
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,360
companies in the world

191
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,599
the ransom demands were not that high so

192
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,240
ransomware was not known yet in this

193
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,919
period

194
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,680
going back going further into 2015

195
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,560
these

196
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,960
groups then realized you need some sort

197
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,639
of hands-on activity

198
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,319
uh in order to succeed you need some

199
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,240
sort of customization that's when we

200
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
started the period is called

201
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,919
post-intrusion ransomware when they

202
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,440
started to use the command and control

203
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,840
server to to give commands and receive

204
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
from the actual environment that they

205
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
have been hacking to uh of course it

206
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,360
meant

207
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,000
that the attacks were more successful

208
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
but also you could target less companies

209
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,039
as you needed more hands-on people

210
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,000
um

211
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,280
and then we go

212
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,120
to maybe the biggest development in

213
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
ransomware which i'm going to talk about

214
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,039
briefly right now which is ransomware as

215
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,080
a service

216
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,120
when these

217
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,360
uh cyber criminals realized

218
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,599
well why don't we just operate like a

219
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,360
normal business does

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,120
uh no company in the world operates

221
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
alone they do delegate parts of the

222
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
operation to others they have partners

223
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
they have suppliers so why shouldn't we

224
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,120
do the same in cyber community as well

225
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,919
so this is ransomware as the services

226
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,639
basically they have subcontractors they

227
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,319
delegate part of

228
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,960
their attack to others and then get the

229
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,360
revenue

230
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,879
this of course means that the the big

231
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,680
bosses they're going to be away from the

232
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
actual operations less likely to be

233
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,080
caught from the legal environment

234
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
agencies and therefore the more likely

235
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,360
that they're going to be

236
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
working for longer periods of time

237
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
and lastly uh which is the period that

238
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,759
we today call us

239
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,599
name and shame in the last two three

240
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,839
years ransomware groups became even

241
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,440
smarter and they said

242
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,919
well wait we're just encrypting the data

243
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,240
why do why don't we steal first and see

244
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
what happens so they're they're

245
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,360
demanding

246
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,000
uh payment for both to decrypt the data

247
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,880
and also uh uh to not release them uh

248
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,040
there were some questions about gdpr

249
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,959
in the morning this is when gdpr comes

250
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,720
into question one of the reasons why

251
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,320
they're stealing the data is that the

252
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,160
companies have more pressure to pay the

253
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,000
ransom because of the data leakages

254
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,440
um

255
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
back to the movies

256
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,160
if you watch movies with hackers with

257
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,800
with attackers basically they are

258
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,920
single man

259
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,519
working the basement wearing who this

260
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,399
far from reality this picture shows an

261
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,839
entire ecosystem to all the main actors

262
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,160
that work in a ransomware group with the

263
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,080
main guys being the so-called ransomware

264
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,240
as a service operators these are the top

265
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,560
management of a company these are the

266
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,720
big bosses

267
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,480
like any other company they have their

268
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,839
own departments oops

269
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,399
they have a development team so it's the

270
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,480
people that actually develops the code i

271
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
make sure that they're undetectable as

272
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,279
sophisticated as destructive as possible

273
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,200
of course you also have the testing team

274
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
which makes sure that things run

275
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,440
normally they have an hr department they

276
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,800
do recruitment

277
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,240
those people are just people at the end

278
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,920
of the day they have christmas

279
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,440
they take vacations so of course they

280
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,000
have to apply to the hr department for

281
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,160
to take vacation they have a finance

282
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,040
department dealing with finances

283
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,640
and so on and so on basically like a

284
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,399
normal company

285
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,480
they have an i.t so they just forgot no

286
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,160
company can exist with an i.t they need

287
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,839
an infrastructure they need servers they

288
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,680
need websites they need everything else

289
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,120
so they have a department for that as

290
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,079
well

291
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,920
but what makes the difference here is

292
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,240
that the next two actors with the first

293
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,560
one being initial access brokers which

294
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,160
is a

295
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,320
subset of groups a smaller group

296
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,560
specialized in just one thing uh which

297
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,959
is getting initial access into an

298
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,040
environment a company and then solving

299
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,360
that access to the bigger guys

300
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,040
there are some that choose to to work

301
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
just with with one ransomware group the

302
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
others that just sell it to everyone can

303
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,800
basically make as much money as you can

304
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,160
the next

305
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,320
which is affiliates

306
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,880
also a subgroup of criminals but now

307
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,480
specializing in the other part of an

308
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,959
attack so initial access brokers get the

309
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,040
access affiliates are those that

310
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,880
actually perform the attack these are

311
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,120
the people that deploy the ransomware

312
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,600
as you can see these people operators

313
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,720
they're far

314
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,519
back they're not in the battlefield so

315
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,760
they're if one athlete gets caught

316
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
affiliate group if they got caught the

317
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,160
police they basically just replace them

318
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,760
and they keep going their operation as

319
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,800
normal

320
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,920
uh two other concepts negotiators

321
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,560
um after they ask for very ransom

322
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,600
usually companies refuse to to to pay

323
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,200
but if they do pay they want to

324
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
negotiate so they don't pay the whole

325
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,640
sum so they have people that actually

326
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,880
are good with negotiating and paying in

327
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,279
bitcoin and you know those technology

328
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,680
technicalities that that should be done

329
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,360
and lastly but not the least money

330
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,720
launderer

331
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,320
these people make millions if not

332
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,160
billions and they have to do something

333
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,800
with the money so they have specialized

334
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,959
people that do do the money laundering

335
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,760
so

336
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,040
as you can see

337
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,600
far away from from the movies from away

338
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,440
from a single man these these

339
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,600
organizations if i call call them have

340
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,880
hundreds of

341
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,480
employees on their payroll

342
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,240
this is just a demonstration on how how

343
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
the actually initial access brokers work

344
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,040
and how we could actually monitor the

345
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,200
operations we could have prevented

346
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,000
certain attacks

347
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,040
on the left side you you see a timeline

348
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,839
of february 16 last year

349
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,320
some initial access broker says that uh

350
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,720
there was selling access to a billion

351
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,920
dollar

352
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,959
industry

353
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,279
uh it was as you can see here it's just

354
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,880
i guess it's hard to see it's in russian

355
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,680
but it says rdp and one million and then

356
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,519
you have the cost over there

357
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,880
two days later the the excess was sold

358
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,920
uh another two days yes later this

359
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,720
ransomware group called dark side uh

360
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,839
claims to have compromised this american

361
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,399
company called gyro data which then a

362
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,480
days later confirmed that they were

363
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
compromised between 16th

364
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,880
and uh 22nd of

365
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,920
uh february 2021 i haven't analyzed this

366
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,320
but i love i believe the source that i

367
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,360
got it from but imagine if this initial

368
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,000
access broker i was monitored there and

369
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,920
the company actually would do something

370
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,160
to block this access

371
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,079
and again it shows how effective they

372
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,560
are within a days and they get access

373
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,920
deploy ransomware and whatnot

374
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,560
uh some numbers for those that are fans

375
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,440
of

376
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,680
on the left side

377
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,839
uh i've put the numbers of victims

378
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,760
uh for the last year and when i say

379
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,320
number of victims is the companies that

380
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,199
refuse to pay and their data was leaked

381
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,839
on those extortion sites so ransomware

382
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,120
groups have

383
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,000
these extortion sites where they

384
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
leak the data if the companies fail to

385
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,199
pay

386
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,600
it's a long list of the airport

387
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,240
top three ransomware groups at least by

388
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
the number of victims who decides for

389
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,440
last year where

390
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,160
paisa log bit and conti

391
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,079
if you do the math these three combined

392
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,959
have more than one thousand uh victims

393
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,560
on on those

394
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
on those extortion sites and the total

395
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,399
number for last year at least some of

396
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,760
the main groups is more than 2 500

397
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,040
victims

398
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,440
one can just imagine that maybe the

399
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,720
majority of the victims refuse to pay

400
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,399
so the number of

401
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,680
victims of ransomware is even higher

402
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,440
on the on the other side you see the

403
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,959
same numbers

404
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,279
but divided by the time

405
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,480
on the last two years 20 january 2020 to

406
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,399
december 2021

407
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,079
as you can see the number of

408
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,880
victims initially was relatively low and

409
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,639
then around

410
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,079
june july

411
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
something happened and the number is

412
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,360
high since

413
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,199
and it's not expected to

414
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,480
to lower down

415
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,000
and uh

416
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,680
you can maybe imagine what happened back

417
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,240
then is is the famous corona happened

418
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,839
and uh

419
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,240
again anything any global event that's

420
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,399
gonna happen uh in the world it's gonna

421
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,959
affect the cyber criminals

422
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,959
uh all of a sudden companies were forced

423
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,839
to have their workforce working remotely

424
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,880
open some pores expose some services and

425
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
they did this in a sort of uncontrolled

426
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,079
manner let's just give this guy

427
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,120
rdp

428
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
access to this server this can work from

429
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,199
home he works in it we know him he needs

430
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,199
that access

431
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,800
but this led to

432
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,519
to increase number of ransomware attacks

433
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,079
worldwide

434
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,040
i'm not sure if you can see it but i'll

435
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,120
continue with the numbers briefly

436
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,759
how much ransomware how much companies

437
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,279
pay and ransom uh their the data for two

438
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,240
years

439
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,839
and of course

440
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,160
the ransom payments depend depends on

441
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
also the size of a company on on

442
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,199
location and and all what not but

443
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,839
in average at least for for last year

444
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,639
2021 companies paid around half a

445
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,079
million dollar in ransom of course

446
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,040
this is not the actual amount that

447
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,519
these groups were asking for so usually

448
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,160
you're able to negotiate these terms but

449
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,320
um one can see that if you compare these

450
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
numbers to a year before numbers are

451
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,680
actually doubling

452
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,120
year by year

453
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,440
on the right side you just see

454
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
some of the most known attacks

455
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,880
transformer attacks

456
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
for the last year and the amount of

457
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
money that the comm actually companies

458
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,519
paid and you see there 50 million 40

459
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,519
million 11 million

460
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,680
uh you do your math

461
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,000
as a few such attacks per year for these

462
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,639
groups and you see how fast that we will

463
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,480
reach a billion dollars in revenue

464
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,440
i wish you could see this but uh daniel

465
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,360
we had this discussion about

466
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
ethics of these groups and how they work

467
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,680
and how much actually these people that

468
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,320
work in these ransom groups know what

469
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
they're doing

470
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,920
and uh even though you don't see this

471
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,559
this is from conte one of the it was on

472
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,280
the top of that list uh this it's a

473
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
group that's believed to be operating

474
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,880
with orbit link to russia um and

475
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,799
this group decided to take

476
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,319
uh to take a stand when the war in

477
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,760
ukraine started and they said there will

478
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,480
be support in ukraine

479
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,160
but uh unfortunately for them they had

480
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
one ukrainian team member

481
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,119
uh which didn't like what their bosses

482
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,080
were doing so he decided or she actually

483
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,520
called their data

484
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,919
especially chats and for us researchers

485
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,720
as

486
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,880
a gold mine where

487
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,559
that's what we wanted to understand how

488
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,360
these people actually operate and one of

489
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,640
the things you could

490
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,039
have seen in this slide is

491
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,760
how the hr talks to a potential

492
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
guy that they were recruiting and they

493
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,400
say do you know what we do

494
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,240
and uh

495
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,919
basically the guy saying well not

496
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,760
exactly but something that it's not

497
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,679
completely legal then

498
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,679
basically they know that they're working

499
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,840
something illegal that is illegal but i

500
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
don't think at least the

501
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,600
smaller fish i don't really know they

502
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,760
know the extent of the work they're

503
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,360
doing basically they're

504
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,919
being hired by a company that says well

505
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,640
we need this big strong encryption and

506
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
it's not completely legal but i don't

507
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,000
think these people go further into

508
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,440
analyzing what they're what they're

509
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,600
actually doing um

510
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,760
the same group also

511
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,760
the management is not that transparent

512
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,880
transparent

513
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
to to the employees same to most of the

514
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,360
companies there are and you see chats of

515
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
people talking with each other saying

516
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,600
wait we're using the same tool as this

517
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,720
other group

518
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,440
are aren't the r b the same

519
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
so there is a lot of question and

520
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,200
discussion here but uh

521
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,440
a lot of these people

522
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
some of these groups work by fixed

523
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,160
amount of money or percentage uh some or

524
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,000
some others just get paid by a fixed

525
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
salary

526
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,200
for example for county there are a lot

527
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,360
of sources that saying this

528
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,600
these people get paid a 2 000

529
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,880
per month

530
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,200
in russia that's quite a lot of

531
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
a good salary

532
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,640
anyway

533
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,039
um

534
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,600
my goal was to best to get you familiar

535
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,080
with with a ransomware attack and why

536
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,840
it's relevant and why it's working today

537
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,080
so a part other part of my job is the

538
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,640
incident response uh this is when people

539
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,799
actually don't like or companies don't

540
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,600
like seeing people like me it means that

541
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,039
 has

542
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,280
hit the fan so it means the company is

543
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,880
hacked and they have no idea what to do

544
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,740
and they call people like me

545
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,600
[Applause]

546
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,120
i'm going to go briefly through the

547
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,080
whole process and give you some some of

548
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,120
my personal advice or experience i'll

549
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,600
start with preparation i've i've left a

550
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,000
slide in we had a question what to do if

551
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
you're hit with by ransomware to prevent

552
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,559
for from ransomware but the first phase

553
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,480
is preparation and the usual is the

554
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,880
phase that get neglected the most is

555
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
basically what to you do to make sure

556
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,760
that you prevent such attacks but also

557
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,240
what you do to make sure that you

558
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,159
respond to them in the most effective

559
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,480
way should they happen

560
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,760
i'll go

561
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,840
into more details in the others a

562
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,480
detection is how do you know that you

563
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,840
have been infected with ransomware

564
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,080
um ransomware is pretty verbose i would

565
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
say it's an attack and you will realize

566
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,240
pretty fast that you have been attacked

567
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,760
by ransomware

568
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,400
basically it's friday afternoon people

569
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,240
want to send their last emails or do

570
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,000
their last notification on their files

571
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and all of a sudden things stopped

572
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,480
working that's one way to do it

573
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,880
and of course the it department gets a

574
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,799
lot of calls things are not working

575
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,200
website is down this and that so that's

576
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
that's one way of doing it another way

577
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,840
is through ransom notes

578
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,120
these groups

579
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,799
put some files on these compromised

580
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,960
environments when they give details

581
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,840
about

582
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,280
about the attack and they say you should

583
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,679
pay this amount into this account and

584
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,000
etc etc so that's one way another way of

585
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,760
knowing that you have been a victim of

586
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,480
ransomware a third one here just

587
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,320
ideal case you have some detection rules

588
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
in place and those detection rules

589
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,880
trigger

590
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,799
let's say you have a detection rule

591
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,640
that's going to trigger an alarm that if

592
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,400
your exchange or email server is going

593
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,720
to all of a sudden send 10 gigabytes of

594
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,280
data to an ip in russia you have no ipa

595
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,679
business in russia why should the mail

596
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,600
server be communicating to you to russia

597
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
and then you start investigating and at

598
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,360
some point you realize that uh you're

599
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
gonna be you have been a target of

600
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,000
ransomware

601
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,799
uh analysis

602
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,400
um

603
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,039
this has two main goals

604
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,080
uh the first one is to know what kind of

605
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,720
ransomware variant has you been

606
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,760
hacked with

607
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,200
you know there are a lot of brands a lot

608
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,080
of groups all of them have their own

609
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,440
uniqueness

610
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,240
knowing how to respond it's also based

611
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,480
on knowing what you're responding to

612
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,080
so the first thing you do is know what

613
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,159
kind of ransom are you talking about

614
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,400
usually if you see the file extensions

615
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,080
of the files that have been encrypted

616
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
you're going to do some googling within

617
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,840
seconds you're going to know what kind

618
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,120
of random variants are we talking about

619
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,280
the second phase is

620
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,159
determined how we ended up there doing

621
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,200
some initial root cause analysis

622
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,400
um

623
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,280
a lot of ways these hackers could get in

624
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,320
but uh um i've listed here four

625
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,200
scenarios uh with the three first three

626
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,480
one being

627
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,799
internet exposed services

628
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,120
um and the first two you have

629
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,919
valid credentials as the way in you can

630
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,440
either do phishing to get valid

631
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
credentials

632
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,120
or do password cracking

633
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,320
or guessing as it called or you can even

634
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,000
buy those

635
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,720
credentials somewhere in the dark web

636
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,799
the third one is a vulnerability in

637
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,600
those exposed services on past

638
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,919
vulnerability and the last one there is

639
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,880
just basically you have a phishing email

640
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,360
with a malicious attachment which is

641
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,159
dropped as a malware in the environment

642
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,679
of course there are other ways these are

643
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,280
just examples but it's important to know

644
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
when you're investigating to try to

645
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
understand what kind of initial root

646
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,080
cause

647
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,600
you're talking about

648
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,280
it's not always easy sometimes you will

649
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,159
never

650
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,520
find the answer

651
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,360
you have no maybe time and budget to go

652
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,039
back in time and try to figure out those

653
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:25,919
things

654
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,559
but that this is the purpose of this

655
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,919
phase

656
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,840
the next three phases which are usually

657
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
grouped together is

658
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,840
uh first one is

659
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,200
containment which is

660
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,880
stopping the bleeding if you're talking

661
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,320
in the physical world

662
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,600
you have let's say car accident the er

663
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,039
services go there and the first thing

664
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,200
they do is well they quickly realize

665
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,440
what's going on and stop try to stop the

666
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,880
bleeding of a patient otherwise the

667
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,279
patient is going to simply die so this

668
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,880
is the phase when you try stopping the

669
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,559
ransomware from spreading further in

670
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,799
your infrastructure i just because part

671
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,400
of your infrastructure is infected it

672
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,679
doesn't mean that your whole

673
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,600
infrastructure infected to try to

674
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
isolate whatever you can

675
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,440
this is also the face when a lot of

676
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,520
people make mistakes so if i ask you

677
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
what do you do if you're sure that your

678
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,679
computer is hacked i'm pretty sure most

679
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,919
of you are going to say well let's

680
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,880
unplug the cable shut down the computer

681
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,840
well

682
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,159
that's a way of doing it uh definitely

683
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,919
not the way that we

684
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,080
recommend to our clients

685
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,679
by doing so you're going to lose a lot

686
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,120
of artifacts that you're going to help

687
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,679
you in the next phases you're going to

688
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,720
lose all the data that is in memory

689
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
you might have the encryption key in in

690
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,240
memory uh

691
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,840
you lose there are a lot of malware that

692
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,240
runs just in memories you literally use

693
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,919
a lot of data from memory you lose a lot

694
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,840
of data from from the network so

695
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,960
basically don't unplug the cable unless

696
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,320
someone that knows what they're doing

697
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,640
says to do so the best way to do this is

698
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,039
just disconnect all the infected

699
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,039
devices from the internet

700
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,200
of course a lot of practicalities there

701
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,520
this is where our network segmentation

702
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,000
comes into place in ideal case when your

703
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,679
environment has

704
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,279
different zones and you know that one

705
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,600
zone is disconnected you have one switch

706
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,520
and then you go and unplug the switch

707
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,440
but of course in practice

708
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,520
not only here but all over the world

709
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
companies are not

710
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,039
are not that advanced yet they know

711
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,960
you're going to see a lot of things and

712
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,720
you have to do a lot of

713
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,400
tweaking there and try to come with the

714
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,159
best based output there this is critical

715
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,240
face this is time sensitive

716
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,640
this is the face when everyone starts

717
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,799
yelling at you they have no idea what

718
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,440
they're doing um especially big bosses

719
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,279
that have no idea about technology the

720
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,279
decision makers you're like we want to

721
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,919
be back our services have to be back our

722
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,559
website has to be back sure but we need

723
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,240
to we all we have to be

724
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,919
so this is really the stressful

725
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,250
situation there so you have to be quite

726
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,000
[Music]

727
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,240
patient with those people and try to

728
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,559
explain to them that things have to wait

729
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,120
uh the next one is eradication

730
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,720
you know which systems are infected you

731
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,640
know ransomware you have to make sure

732
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,400
that you start removing the ransomware

733
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,240
from the infected systems

734
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,760
and you have to make sure that you

735
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,360
remove the ransomware from all the

736
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,600
infected systems whether that systems in

737
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,520
the clouds endpoints

738
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,919
servers what not it can be a lengthy

739
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,960
process

740
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,880
but has to be done

741
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,120
and last phase within this phase is

742
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,400
recovery

743
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,240
going back to normal

744
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,480
this is when companies ask should we pay

745
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,279
the ransom and we say no but then they

746
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,080
don't have backups let me tell them why

747
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,520
don't you have backups but it's actually

748
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,760
too too late to talk about what they

749
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,919
don't have and what they do have

750
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,760
and they're like well we'll do what we

751
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,480
can

752
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,880
ideal scenario they have backups we just

753
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,240
need to make sure that the backups

754
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,039
itself are not infected we restore from

755
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,200
from the backups that's ideal another

756
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,520
one is if you could find a decryption

757
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,440
tool if you could decrypt

758
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,520
the algorithm that's another way the

759
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,760
other one is basically do nothing get a

760
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,960
clean os

761
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,559
i hope for the best

762
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,840
and the last one is pay the

763
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,039
ransom i hope you never get to that

764
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,200
stage but that's a way to do it

765
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,960
last phase also often ignored lesson

766
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,159
learned

767
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,000
companies got hacked they investigate

768
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,399
the ransomware somehow

769
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,399
pay a lot of millions

770
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,240
and they're happy with it because you're

771
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,000
back to the operations

772
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,760
they never said to discuss

773
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,080
did we actually do it well did they pay

774
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,159
too much did we need so do we need

775
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,039
something more what can we learn from

776
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,520
this and just keep going take the old

777
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
way and of course things can happen

778
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,559
again

779
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,360
so lesson learned it's not just the face

780
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,120
that you learn in the books in practice

781
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
it's really important to make sure that

782
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,799
things don't don't happen again in the

783
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,200
future

784
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,440
i left this slide for the end as i was

785
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
not sure how much time i have and i have

786
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,679
no idea how much time i spent but

787
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,360
when it comes to preparation the most

788
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,440
important phase maybe a lot of things

789
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,480
you can do

790
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
and a lot of those things are pretty

791
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
simple there's no

792
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,799
artificial intelligence there it's just

793
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,600
simple cyber hygiene if you go back to

794
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,480
the days with corona a lot of controls

795
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,039
by the end of the day you're like

796
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,039
do your hygiene make sure you clean your

797
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,080
hands

798
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,840
we say the same

799
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,600
thing to the digital world as well do

800
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,320
some cyber hygiene first control their

801
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,840
asset inventory

802
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,760
know what you have where you have it

803
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,960
who's the owner what is the use for

804
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
just imagine you're investigating a

805
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,480
ransomware and

806
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,559
where do you start

807
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,399
which servers do you start you start

808
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,840
investigating first

809
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,679
if i go to your company and ask where

810
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,000
should i start and you have no idea you

811
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,760
don't even have an excel list that tells

812
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,320
me all the servers and what they do i'm

813
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,919
going to pick something

814
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,840
most likely it's going to be fine but i

815
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,840
would rather have you know what you have

816
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,760
because you're the owner of

817
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,919
your infrastructure

818
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,760
the second one patching

819
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,520
a good amount of these attacks happen

820
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,720
because of

821
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,559
vulnerabilities

822
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,279
yet again it's easy but not so a lot of

823
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,720
companies have

824
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,279
vulnerabilities that are years old

825
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,279
simply don't have time or

826
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,679
i don't know the resources are simply

827
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,279
there is a lot of vulnerabilities that

828
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,080
are being exploited

829
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,200
modern policy password policy yeah you

830
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
all know what a strong password is

831
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
yet again in practice

832
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,320
uh this doesn't apply maybe to it sdit

833
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,320
wants to have admin admin as their

834
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,600
credentials and of course they get

835
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,640
hacked so

836
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,159
make sure that there's strong passwords

837
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,559
all over your organization and those

838
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,559
passwords that are known to be leaked

839
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,279
are not used this applies to everyone in

840
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,120
your organization there is no exception

841
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,679
for iq or anyone else

842
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,880
mfa

843
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,039
if strong password this is one of the

844
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,360
best controls use multi-factor

845
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,000
authentication whenever you can it's

846
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,799
gonna

847
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,480
help you a lot

848
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,559
segment your network i briefly talked

849
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,840
about this

850
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,120
make sure that

851
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,159
you limit your damage to one zone or two

852
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,000
zones make sure that the ransomware

853
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,760
doesn't spread to your whole

854
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,600
organization

855
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,000
backups i cannot stress how important

856
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,120
this is

857
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,399
when it comes to whether it should be

858
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,159
appear should be not

859
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,840
backup is the solution if you have the

860
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,600
backups you simply don't pay

861
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,440
i say save yourself some millions

862
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,480
all those

863
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,080
and most of those the others are

864
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,600
technology based

865
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,240
one that not a lot of people talk is

866
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,039
about

867
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,000
the human factor and security for years

868
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,159
we have believed that security is

869
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,760
a technology problem it's going to be

870
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,840
solved just by technology

871
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,600
that's not completely wrong that's not

872
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,240
completely accurate as well

873
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,159
invest in all the best technologies in

874
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,919
the world you're still going to have one

875
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,840
stupid guy in your team that's going to

876
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,080
click on the fishing link

877
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,519
well sorry

878
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,720
you neglected people so we need to spend

879
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,880
time into educating our staff to

880
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,799
understand what their role in security

881
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:05,440
is

882
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,159
we have they all play a role they should

883
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,039
be part of the team so user awareness

884
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,840
user education and stuff like that

885
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,679
dark web monitoring

886
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,440
that's we're going into more advanced

887
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,640
terms but

888
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,720
this initial access

889
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
these things get sold in dark web and

890
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,480
other we talk with some of you about

891
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,000
these kind of things being solved in

892
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,919
telegram and other other sources it

893
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,919
doesn't have to be dark web but

894
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,679
monitoring this kind of sources that are

895
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,399
being used by cyber criminals and also

896
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,399
it's a good control

897
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,080
intelligence-based security which is the

898
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,080
first slide i was talking about

899
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,919
understanding how these threat actors

900
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,120
work uh what kind of tools they use

901
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,799
let's say this

902
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,360
one of those groups use this tool a

903
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,399
clone whatever for exiltrating the data

904
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,600
and

905
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,679
you see that tool in in your environment

906
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,080
and you have no idea what it is

907
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
but if you knew that the tools used by

908
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,000
this group for exfiltration it could

909
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,760
have stopped the group from stealing the

910
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,600
data so this is

911
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,200
knowing yourself

912
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,360
but also knowing the hackers if you know

913
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,000
that you don't use the tool combined but

914
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,840
knowing that someone else some group

915
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,080
uses the tool why don't you simply make

916
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,120
a detection rule or a blocking rule and

917
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,960
some of these things are solved

918
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,039
uh lastly

919
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,440
incident response plans

920
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,399
worst comes to worst you get hacked who

921
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,480
do you call

922
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,720
physical words we all know the name of

923
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,840
the number of

924
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
the emergency services

925
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,399
you get hacked today who do you call

926
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,240
what is the number

927
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,480
uh you want to

928
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,399
10 seconds uh

929
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,519
you have to

930
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,080
talk to your employees how if the email

931
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,240
is working it's not working how do you

932
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,760
how do you communicate

933
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,840
things like that should be in part of

934
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,840
your incident response plan i think i

935
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,640
have used my time that was that was all

936
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,440
for me thank you very much
