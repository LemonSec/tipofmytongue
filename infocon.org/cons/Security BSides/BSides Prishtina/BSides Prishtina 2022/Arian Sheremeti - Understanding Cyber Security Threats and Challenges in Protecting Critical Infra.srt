1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,640
it's been great to see some of my old

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,320
friends and also to meet some of the new

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,160
ones here

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,080
uh as you heard

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,840
the good news is that i'm the last

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,519
speaker for the day so you get to go

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,960
home after this

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,359
the bad news is that first edition of

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,080
besides pristina is coming to an end

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,480
and with that said i would like to thank

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,519
the host university of christina

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,080
organizers

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,159
who did the logistics

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,480
behind it but most importantly i want to

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,200
thank you all of you especially the

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,399
international

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,079
speakers that we had that they took

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,399
their time and effort to come here to

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,960
share their knowledge

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,440
so thank you and let's give yourself a

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,040
round of flowers

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,120
[Applause]

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
so before i get started

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,920
let me just maybe briefly introduce

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,000
myself

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
uh i lived abroad for 17 years i moved

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,280
back to kosovo about six years ago

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
i don't have formal uh

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,000
informational cyber security

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,439
education

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,400
initially i was into systems networks

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,080
and then i decided to go to the business

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,560
side of it

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,640
and i went into

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,200
it audit grc i used to work for pwc

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,040
for deloitte before

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,159
and

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,479
then transitioning to information

39
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,960
security was kind of natural

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,320
and i've been enjoying it since then um

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,320
today um

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
by the way i'm the last speaker so i got

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,520
to choose like my topic i didn't want to

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,119
repeat myself

45
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,920
i wanted to touch on something

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,640
that is a little bit different

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,880
in critical infrastructure

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,479
and what are some of the threats what

49
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,560
are some of the challenges and

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,040
this presentation

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,840
it's tailored more for

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,000
kosovo situation

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,399
and circumstances and

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,160
where we are and what we need to do

55
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,120
so

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,200
the pictures that you are seeing here

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,360
this is taken

58
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,840
i believe in

59
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,920
2021 in geneva summit

60
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,480
president biden and putin

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,760
it was then that president biden handed

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,120
a list of

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,760
some of the critical infrastructure

64
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,200
sectors that are off limits

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,239
according to to cesar agency the federal

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,400
agency u.s federal agency there are 16

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,760
sectors and we're going to be looking at

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,519
those

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,800
later on

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,760
but before i get into any further uh let

71
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,040
me maybe just uh briefly uh to those

72
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,000
that are not very familiar with what a

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
critical infrastructure is

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,680
it's basically

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,400
systems and assets that are vital to

76
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,920
national defense to national security

77
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,239
economic security public health and

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,080
everything else and

79
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,280
these can be either public or private

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
institutions

81
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,050
cyber security

82
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,280
[Music]

83
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,560
infrastructure

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,680
agency u.s agency has identified 16

85
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,000
critical sectors

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,720
i have listed over here um

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,040
only a few of them telecommunication

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,799
financial services

89
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,239
energy sector

90
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,920
water management

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,959
and and so on and so forth

92
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,640
so now that uh we know

93
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,239
what

94
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,040
critical infrastructure is let's uh

95
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,720
dive into deeper

96
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,519
and let's look like

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,680
why they are prone what are the risks

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
what are the challenges

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,200
so

100
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
mostly but not necessarily as

101
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,239
geopolitical tensions rise then there's

102
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,200
escalation and you see that hike of a

103
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,159
number of attacks

104
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,239
lately we have seen with russian

105
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,120
invasion of ukraine but honestly

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
uh attacks uh of cyber attacks in in in

107
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,479
critical infrastructure they go way back

108
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,520
uh maybe the most or

109
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
perfect example that we can give it's

110
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
stuxnet

111
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,120
uh

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,280
it's pretty old it happened about 12

113
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,800
years ago but it's still very important

114
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,280
and i like to take this an example of

115
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,080
how prone and

116
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,240
all sectors are due to

117
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
such attacks

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,759
so for those that are not familiar uh

119
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,120
in 2010 it was discovered that uh

120
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,400
iran's uranium enrichment plant

121
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
was attacked

122
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
at that time

123
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,199
obviously these are all plans that are

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,199
isolated you don't have direct internet

125
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,800
access to those

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,120
mostly they have this air gap this

127
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,000
buffer zone with physical security

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,039
so somehow a usb got

129
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,720
smuggled in

130
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,600
it was a windows os

131
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,080
zero day vulnerability exploded

132
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
and then from there on they could

133
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,600
control

134
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,039
the siemens

135
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,560
system by changing the centrifuge

136
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,080
speed

137
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,680
a very

138
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,440
sophisticated cyber weapon when you

139
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,199
think about it and this happened like 12

140
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,320
years ago

141
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,440
at least uh we know about it since 2010

142
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,960
uh 2010

143
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,759
and

144
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,840
most likely this happened even earlier

145
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,239
than that

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,720
another may be a recent case it's

147
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
colonial oil pipeline which happened

148
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,880
last year

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,360
it's one of the largest pipeline systems

150
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,080
in u.s

151
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,520
and it was a victim of ransomware

152
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,479
and

153
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,880
11 000 gas stations were without the gas

154
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,479
what that created was uh the prices went

155
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,199
up there was a panic

156
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,919
for those that live in u.s or have

157
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,240
family in us they can

158
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,800
maybe have like more vivid

159
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,199
memory

160
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,880
so

161
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840
why now

162
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,199
operational technology which by the way

163
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,960
refers to computer

164
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,800
systems that are used to manage these in

165
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,960
plants are separated from i.t and then

166
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,440
as we go on

167
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,280
uh

168
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,240
before they were in silas now with uh

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,120
evolution of

170
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,680
industry especially with a 4.0

171
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,000
technology uh we start to see this

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
convergence of putting

173
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,639
additional devices that are linked to

174
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,000
network

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and all of a sudden this

176
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,360
buffer this air gap is starting to fade

177
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,840
till there's no more actually like any

178
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
any segregation between

179
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,280
ot and it

180
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,680
today uh not today but

181
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,960
for a very long time now we live in a

182
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
digitized world

183
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,560
a world where we have like

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,720
complex software networks etc

185
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,360
things are coming more like integrated

186
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,400
and

187
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,000
what that means is that as the

188
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,479
complexity grows then the risk is going

189
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,159
to grow as well at the same time

190
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,759
this is the industry evolution and

191
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,919
one of the reason why this is happening

192
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,599
right now when we are seeing more

193
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,599
attacks is that

194
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,160
we are seeing at least this is in in

195
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,400
developing countries where

196
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,120
they are moving from industry 3.0 to

197
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,080
industry 4.0

198
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,599
uh industry 4.0 refers to new phase in

199
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,759
industrial revolution that focuses

200
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,039
heavily on on disk of

201
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,680
interconnectivity

202
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,160
automation machine learning and and so

203
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,960
on

204
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
so now the businesses are feeling this

205
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
pressure of keeping up maximizing their

206
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,599
profits

207
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,880
and

208
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,120
they go in and

209
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,000
without realizing the full

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
risks

211
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,559
challenges

212
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,958
that they're going to be facing and what

213
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,519
it takes in order to mitigate some of

214
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,160
those risks

215
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,680
threat actors they remain the same

216
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,920
some of the challenges or at least some

217
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,160
of the main challenges

218
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,680
is that

219
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,640
awareness so there's a limited

220
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,200
knowledge uh

221
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,760
the ots these are like

222
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,440
old systems

223
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,560
that they are

224
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
vulnerable and

225
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,920
we don't even know that they are

226
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,959
vulnerable

227
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,680
and what it takes in order to fix them

228
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,839
second is visibility so there's little

229
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,880
insight on how to protect these ot

230
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,320
systems

231
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,480
what does it take and because they play

232
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,120
critical role in our lives

233
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,440
mostly these people who operate them

234
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,399
they tend more to go or

235
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,560
stability will take priority

236
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
over security

237
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,200
if it's not broken don't fix it leave it

238
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,399
there

239
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,760
i already mentioned that the

240
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,920
segmentation

241
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,399
but let me go back maybe maintenance

242
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,440
so these are legacy systems that at that

243
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,200
time when they were built

244
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,600
they were not built with security in

245
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,440
their mind

246
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,040
there are no passes

247
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,160
or maybe if there are patches as i said

248
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,240
they might think that oh this is going

249
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,800
to affect our stability and let's leave

250
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,719
them let's like postpone them

251
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,560
obviously

252
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,240
the speakers

253
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
before they talked about the incident

254
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,760
response so

255
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,560
they're talking about the i.t modern id

256
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,360
uh but think about like if you are

257
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,079
operating a energy plant

258
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,959
and you want to conduct a a for example

259
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,360
an exercise of how you're gonna respond

260
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,839
to a incident

261
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,839
do they have any playbooks do they have

262
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,720
any processes in place in place for

263
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,320
those things

264
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,839
maybe they do in some of the countries

265
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,839
uh in here in kosovo we're gonna look

266
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,640
later um

267
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,560
how that plays out

268
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,880
uh overall it's a

269
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,079
lack of governance of how ot and it are

270
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,160
gonna play together are going to come

271
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,560
together

272
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,760
so let's look at the kosovo critical

273
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
infrastructure

274
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,560
as of april 2019

275
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,720
critical infrastructure law was passed

276
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
it was enforced

277
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
but implementation in practice it's

278
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
quite challenging remained

279
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,720
still it's a challenge

280
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,399
we have

281
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,880
one strategy and two laws that they are

282
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,120
still in draft

283
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,279
for example we have a cyber security

284
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,480
strategy which it's outdated

285
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,959
and this was outdated three years ago so

286
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,880
can you imagine a gap of three years

287
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
we don't have a strategy and again

288
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
strategy is something that you can

289
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,160
easily put it on a paper but then

290
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,719
going and implementing and

291
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,480
executing it

292
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,800
it's quite challenging

293
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,720
so we do have the critical

294
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
infrastructure law however we do have

295
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
law cyber security which is still on

296
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,839
draft

297
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,639
and then the other law on security of

298
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,600
networks and information systems that is

299
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,560
also still in in draft version

300
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,399
uh i'm not sure at least i'm i'm

301
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,480
i'm not aware that uh

302
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,279
if government of kosovo has harmonized

303
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,240
them or there are groups that i know

304
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,560
that there are groups for each of like

305
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,079
strategy and two laws but i don't know

306
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,680
if they are like

307
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,600
talking to each other to see like how

308
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,320
can

309
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,200
uh harmonize this laws so

310
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
if we don't have

311
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,920
laws in place uh i don't think that

312
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,399
anybody is gonna go on their will and

313
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,360
and then

314
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,600
take all the effort to go

315
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,040
so

316
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,200
kosovo uh

317
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,160
has 11 sectors

318
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,399
um

319
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,279
danger goods energy financial services

320
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,560
food

321
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,120
facilities healthcare

322
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,839
is

323
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,079
ict national values public services

324
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,440
transport and then water supply

325
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,639
i did look at the law

326
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,560
and then something that really stands

327
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,839
out

328
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,200
from the list i don't know if you can

329
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,839
see it well

330
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
do you guys think that anything stands

331
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,440
out from the list

332
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
maybe it's just me but i was looking at

333
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,399
the national values number eight

334
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,920
like what that is like what does that

335
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,120
entail

336
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,199
there was no explanation in the law it

337
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,320
was just listed as a national values

338
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,000
whereas we are talking about the

339
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,240
critical infrastructure

340
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,040
something that is critical and if

341
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,560
it's hit

342
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,480
then we're going to suffer but

343
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,560
it's still there

344
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,920
so

345
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,519
for good or for bad majority of ci

346
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,680
sectors in kosovo are not yet digitized

347
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,440
and i'm saying for good or for bad

348
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,720
because

349
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,240
if they were digitized i'm not sure if

350
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,920
we have

351
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,959
enough resources whether human resources

352
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,040
whether enough

353
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,839
like budget allocated in order to

354
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,720
address some of the challenges that

355
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,880
we are facing today

356
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,600
but

357
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,839
for how long i know that there is a

358
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,480
pressure on us not only as a country but

359
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,560
a couple of years ago there was a new

360
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,079
energy plant that was going to build i

361
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,000
don't know what happened to it

362
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,839
but we as a society as a newborn

363
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,519
country when we are like

364
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,760
putting them out for procurement we

365
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,040
should know like what are we requiring

366
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,160
what does it take for those

367
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,199
plants uh whatever sectors it is to

368
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,040
maintain them who's going to maintain

369
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,600
them how much is going to cause them

370
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,959
like

371
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,639
how we're going to like fine-tune them

372
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,880
and everything else

373
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,079
we know well that

374
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,480
nothing is out of the box for those that

375
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,000
are very technical they know like you

376
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,279
don't have a solution that comes out of

377
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,880
the box

378
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,839
so today i'm going to focus on only two

379
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,199
other sectors uh financial services and

380
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,880
the telecommunication the isps

381
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,800
so in comparison with other critical

382
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,480
infrastructure sectors financial

383
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,440
services and

384
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,279
it's overall like more resilient in

385
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,199
terms of its ability to to prevent and

386
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,800
to respond to

387
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,440
these cyber incidents

388
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,920
why maybe it's just because of its

389
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,279
nature

390
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,839
some of the banks most of the banks

391
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,199
all of the banks

392
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,279
in cost of at least heavy banking once

393
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,880
you have a e-banking you open yourself

394
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,240
up to to

395
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,839
all of these threats

396
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,360
so

397
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,519
even if you don't want to you are like

398
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,360
forced to take

399
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,759
action

400
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,399
some of the banks in kosovo are part of

401
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,959
the international groups i have listed

402
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,160
some of them so they do help

403
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,639
to implement some of the policies

404
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,360
procedures in place they have a bigger

405
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,639
budget to spend and they bring this

406
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,959
cyber security culture with them and

407
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,199
they instill that into

408
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,920
banks here in kosovo and then

409
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,199
let's not forget the cbk has a

410
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,480
i.t regulation that was enforced a

411
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,560
couple years ago

412
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,759
on march of 2020 and then there was a

413
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,920
six months like a grace period for um

414
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,199
banks

415
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,560
to adopt it and to to go by it and

416
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,000
once in a while

417
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,480
cbk will go around the banks

418
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,079
and will uh perform

419
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,079
assessments whether they are in

420
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,079
compliance with this regulation so

421
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,199
i think for financial sector uh

422
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,919
in comparison like to to other sectors a

423
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,720
financial sector like it stands much

424
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,400
more like better off than the rest of

425
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,679
the sectors

426
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,480
on the other hand we have um smaller

427
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,640
banks which have budget constraints and

428
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,199
it's challenging like to to

429
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,359
give information security a priority

430
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,240
there's a huge staff turnover rate

431
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,559
usually people go from one institution

432
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,960
to another institution and then let's

433
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,640
not forget we have like these

434
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,240
international companies that they come

435
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,679
in and good that they come in we want

436
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,799
them to come in but then they can afford

437
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,240
better wages

438
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,880
and then the staff uh

439
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,640
it's normal uh they get paid more they

440
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,520
go there and then lastly it's brain

441
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,760
drain it's not only the kosovo it's it's

442
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
experiencing that but most of the balkan

443
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,120
countries

444
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,360
where people will choose would rather

445
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,320
choose to go and live and work in in

446
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,440
western europe in us rather than stay

447
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,880
here in kosovo

448
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,600
um

449
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,559
banks at least although i know that uh

450
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,120
in and and like some of the government

451
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,480
authorities

452
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,200
they are like uh these bodies

453
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
uh but

454
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,640
mostly like private sector does not

455
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,360
count on on government authorities

456
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,880
or they don't see them as a strong

457
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,559
partner

458
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
simply because the the government

459
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,679
authorities

460
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,960
again they don't have enough like uh

461
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,919
budget

462
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,000
in order to hire and to retain that

463
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,280
talent

464
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,720
so in most of the cases if they come

465
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,640
across like an incident security

466
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,320
incident they will

467
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,760
report it to to

468
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,760
government authorities but it's not

469
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,200
something that government authorities

470
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,000
like can can offer to to private sector

471
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,039
and then

472
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,000
telecommunications sector so

473
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,360
maybe from

474
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,120
architecture

475
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,799
uh

476
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,840
what's like uh been pretty good about

477
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,960
kosovo is that the

478
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,440
internet penetration rate it's above 90

479
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,480
percent

480
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,320
and that's great and that's thanks to

481
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,480
isps that they have like

482
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,039
the the backbone infrastructure

483
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,799
and international connectivity is

484
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,320
diversified

485
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,640
so they are not going like all in in one

486
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,600
line

487
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,720
um

488
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,480
isps don't rely on the same transition

489
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
lines and then

490
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,400
they have developed national fiber

491
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,720
infrastructure that is largely

492
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,600
independent from each other

493
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,240
on the other hand

494
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,720
most of them or most of the isps are

495
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,600
still in the early age of stage of

496
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,919
readiness to cope with potential

497
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,600
disruptions

498
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,039
i know that some of the isps are

499
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,120
going and and getting

500
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,120
the one of the iso standards 27 0001

501
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,600
the standard is great

502
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
but then again

503
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,360
that standard has to be maintained

504
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,400
and

505
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,080
not just have it there in paper and then

506
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,440
once a year look at it

507
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,880
most of isps do not possess

508
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,000
advanced capabilities uh required to to

509
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,480
manage risk

510
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,799
and then none of the isps are have fully

511
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,960
implemented the cyber security audit

512
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,480
requirements

513
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,520
uh

514
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,120
as they were like given from their

515
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,600
regulator

516
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,880
so

517
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,600
with that said

518
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,679
we conduct all of our business online

519
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,200
and

520
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,360
we do so up through isps so if the isp

521
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,159
is the weakest like link

522
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,720
uh just think about it like a

523
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,679
couple of

524
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,320
months ago or so

525
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,880
i was in my hometown i'm from pear and

526
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,559
then

527
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,360
my

528
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,760
cell phone my isp my cable tv are all

529
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,840
from same provider

530
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,919
and for some reason the provider was

531
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,840
done for five hours it was during the

532
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,039
weekend uh

533
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,360
you are used to have these like cell

534
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,520
phones and then check our email check

535
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,360
alerts what's having like what's going

536
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,159
on

537
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,200
can you imagine like during the daylight

538
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,000
on saturday uh being disconnected so you

539
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,440
don't have

540
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,720
internet

541
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,760
no like

542
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
isp at home was down

543
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
your phone was down and then

544
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,080
even the cable tv

545
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,159
so at that point i was thinking is it a

546
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,960
good thing to have everything through

547
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,679
one provider maybe i should have

548
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,520
like diversify them a little bit you

549
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,280
know at least like if if one of them

550
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,840
goes down i have another isp to

551
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,158
fail over

552
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,679
so

553
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,559
let's look at or maybe let's just like

554
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,919
these are just

555
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,720
very like overall high level

556
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,600
how

557
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,240
and we can build resilience or at least

558
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,320
start to think about building resilience

559
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,039
so there's this triangle of people

560
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,120
processes and technology

561
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,919
and

562
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:24,960
i think

563
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,880
if one of them falls

564
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,640
then everything is going to go like fall

565
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,600
down

566
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,120
you're going to have great people but if

567
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,039
you don't have processes or either way

568
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,039
around if you have processes and people

569
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,039
but you don't have technology

570
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,120
so for people

571
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,880
let's start by

572
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,919
educating them uh and this is from

573
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,760
whatever the highest level is the board

574
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,440
level and then down

575
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,320
about

576
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,840
what are the

577
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,640
cyber security risks

578
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,440
uh usually the board level likes to hear

579
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,200
what is going to cause them

580
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,159
and maybe you need to find that language

581
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,919
and talk about like

582
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,840
use these metrics

583
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,480
then define roles and responsibilities

584
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,360
for your workforce and then establish

585
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,120
this cyber security training process

586
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,679
on the other hand with the processes you

587
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,640
need to define them well

588
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,000
before you define them you need to

589
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
design them and then you need to test

590
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,600
them and see like how these processes

591
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,159
are operating whether they are operating

592
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,480
uh effectively sometimes

593
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,320
you have that process is operating

594
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,280
effectively but it was designed badly so

595
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,720
you want to look at the design of those

596
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
processes of high dose design and

597
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,279
everything else

598
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,720
i'm not going to go through the list

599
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,559
because the previous uh speakers were

600
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,520
already covered most of this stuff about

601
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,440
like developing the incident response

602
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,919
plan having the playbooks and like doing

603
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,679
these regular simulation scenarios

604
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:58,640
uh

605
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,840
in place

606
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,960
and then obviously you need a technology

607
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
like

608
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
part of the architecture infrastructure

609
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,200
that uh

610
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,480
you need some sort of technology in

611
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,960
order like you cannot just remain solely

612
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,600
on on people and and processes and other

613
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,279
way around you can not only

614
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,840
rely on technology uh

615
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,240
for example to leave a cm there and to

616
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,159
hope that you're gonna get some sort of

617
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,080
alerts or antivirus that you're gonna

618
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,240
get these alerts you wanna also have

619
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,080
people there skilled people trained

620
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,919
people but they are going to do some

621
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,320
threat hunting rather than like wait if

622
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,080
they are going to get any any

623
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,559
alerts

624
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:39,679
so

625
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,840
going further into

626
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,720
this

627
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,400
mindset of building resilience into

628
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,640
critical infrastructure

629
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,760
uh i have put down a list of things

630
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,600
that i think at least

631
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,640
these are like overall only few of them

632
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,880
i know that this can be like much longer

633
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,039
but maybe to start the few of them

634
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,679
first one public sector and private

635
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,360
sector they need to work together

636
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,440
closely

637
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,159
one with the other

638
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,840
when it comes to public sector to

639
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,960
government

640
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,880
we need to pass the laws uh on on

641
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,480
cyber security critical infrastructure

642
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,720
and then not just have something on

643
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,480
paper because as you know you can put

644
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,000
everything on paper but then when it

645
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,960
comes to

646
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,760
implement it maintain it support it it's

647
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,279
either like expensive you don't have

648
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,320
people

649
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,480
and then once you have it in place

650
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,799
not just leave a piece of paper

651
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,159
somewhere

652
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,480
down there and then wait when the time

653
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,720
comes like to to review it

654
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,520
but

655
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,159
be like more proactive look at these

656
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,320
laws review them like not wait for

657
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,840
another five years

658
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,159
i know that strategy is three years five

659
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,159
years but it's not something set in

660
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,919
stone that cannot be changed

661
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,760
um

662
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,320
mandatory adoption of some of the cyber

663
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,039
security standards for for at least ci

664
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,240
sector

665
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,760
i have put there two standards uh

666
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,960
62

667
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,799
443

668
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,039
and then also the

669
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,240
nest

670
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,360
the national institute of standards

671
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,679
uh for u.s agency cyber security

672
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,919
framework for critical infrastructure if

673
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,400
you're not going to make them mandatory

674
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,279
i highly doubt that companies are going

675
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,520
to go there and implement them on their

676
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,760
own at least

677
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,520
at least like

678
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,760
not all of them or not majority are not

679
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
even half of them uh who's going to go

680
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,679
and invest or only like proactive

681
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,760
companies that they have budget

682
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,200
they can like

683
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,679
i uh sense the risk

684
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,360
and then they can invest but

685
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,039
if you're gonna leave them without like

686
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,640
if if the

687
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,799
market is not regulated

688
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,799
then nobody's gonna go on volunteer

689
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,559
bases and implement these standards

690
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,080
because uh

691
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,760
they are quite expensive and they

692
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,960
require like a very like special skill

693
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,400
set

694
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,080
and then

695
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,720
if needed as i said like for these laws

696
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,880
uh strategies whatever

697
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,840
let's

698
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,159
like act fast and

699
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,320
review them continuously not only on

700
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
whatever annual basis

701
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,200
uh for example we have us uh

702
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,880
obviously their government it's

703
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,559
structured differently where they can go

704
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,520
and they can

705
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,000
a president can issue an executive order

706
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,679
and so far i think

707
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,360
president biden

708
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,520
has issued one executive order about

709
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,200
improving the national the nation's

710
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,000
cyber security and then the sisa the

711
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,600
federal agency

712
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,760
has mandated a two-week window for

713
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,840
passing serious vulnerabilities for

714
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,520
federal agencies

715
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,320
this is like serious vulnerabilities

716
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,960
within two weeks and that's huge

717
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,120
here in kosovo for those that have like

718
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,600
experience in a public sector it's not

719
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,960
that we have a something like

720
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,080
centralized uh one ministry can be good

721
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,120
the other one not that good

722
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,080
so we need something that

723
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,320
more like a centralized body and we do

724
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,840
have a centralized body which i'm going

725
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,440
to come like uh

726
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,520
to the next point

727
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,240
but uh maybe let's add a legal

728
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,559
requirement to report cyber security

729
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,080
incidents uh

730
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,000
the previous speaker

731
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,760
mentioned one of the agencies that we

732
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,480
have the agency for uh

733
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,039
information and privacy they do require

734
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,240
the law

735
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,760
that if you

736
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,919
they do require by the law that if any

737
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,320
of the data it's leaked then you have a

738
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,880
time frame to to report them

739
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,200
but obviously like they are understaffed

740
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,600
and they cannot go and investigate every

741
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,559
every single thing what's going on

742
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,320
without a doubt for both sectors

743
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,279
this cannot be done if we don't increase

744
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,559
the cyber security like spending budgets

745
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,320
and then

746
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,880
either private sector within the private

747
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,520
sector or public sector or even like as

748
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,440
a joint venture to facilitate these

749
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,559
strategic discussions

750
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,440
um about cyber security

751
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,320
like either workshops

752
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,039
such as this maybe more like a cyber

753
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,279
security conferences

754
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,760
and then last but not least

755
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,720
maybe

756
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,480
to look into i know that we saw before

757
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,799
that we have this national cert but

758
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,440
maybe let's look at creating the

759
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,480
like search for a specific sector

760
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,640
and then let's the institutions of that

761
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,799
sector get together

762
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,840
uh exchange their like uh know-hows

763
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
their experiences and then learn from

764
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,480
from each other

765
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,760
um

766
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,360
this is a picture that i saw in my

767
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,039
presentation uh the list of uh 16

768
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,679
critical infrastructure sectors

769
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,480
that was handed into putin by president

770
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,880
biden

771
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,159
i don't really believe that by saying

772
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,600
that something is off limit they're

773
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,760
going to say okay no problem

774
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,679
don't worry about it

775
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,720
because there's a famous saying

776
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,440
from niccolo machiavelli

777
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,600
and the prince

778
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,679
it says the end justify the means so in

779
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,399
the end of the day

780
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,360
especially in nowadays in like cyber

781
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,919
warfare that we are living

782
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,880
if

783
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,159
something

784
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,840
if you want to do something you want to

785
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
get something then they will justify and

786
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,000
we have seen some horror scenes and

787
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,720
stories uh from ukraine

788
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,520
so by handing in that list i don't think

789
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,559
that

790
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,520
whoever it is russia will have it china

791
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,600
iran they're going to stand back and

792
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,559
obey that order

793
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,440
with that being said uh i don't want to

794
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,519
keep you any longer i know that it's

795
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,000
been a very long day but enjoyable day

796
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,440
at least for me

797
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,760
i know that you guys want to get out

798
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,120
some of you are fasting you want to

799
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,919
break the fast so i'm going to stop here

800
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:16,799
uh

801
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,039
if you guys have any question

802
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,000
i can be i'm happy to answer them
