1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,320
so hello everyone uh i'm glad

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,599
that i'm here to present here

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,000
the zero towards zero trust architecture

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,360
today

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,880
i'm glad that uh

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,080
i'm presenting this first kosovo besides

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,000
uh uh pristina conference

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,720
i'm shkomen sanaya and

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,359
i had a chance

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,640
to present and to participate in many

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
flosk events and mainly those that have

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,680
been like the first one uh in the past

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,160
i participated in software freedom days

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,160
and software freedom conferences

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,160
organized by flosk

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,440
i at that time i was the

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,520
manager or

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,399
took a leading role

19
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,480
to localization of open open office in

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,800
albanian language

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,920
so

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,039
also

23
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,519
i've had a chance to be one of pioneers

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,840
here in kosovo on implementing open

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,920
source solutions mainly intranets uh and

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,960
for

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
government for mainly for municipalities

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,960
um

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,440
and it was based on uh

30
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,960
[Music]

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,159
apache

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,280
php

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,479
uh mysql so there have been some of the

34
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,400
first implementation of open source in

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,780
government

36
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,280
[Music]

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,759
otherwise

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,000
with security i got

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,439
to say

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,400
as an i.t of course you got introduced

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,280
with

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,399
security but like 20 years ago

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,640
one of my first training on internet and

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,360
internet security and once you get into

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,240
it you get some kind of paranoiic into

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,960
it

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,680
and

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,960
it

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,159
takes you

50
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,200
always

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,240
will be

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,479
like with you

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,439
later on i also had some

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,759
say certification on information systems

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,598
management on iso 27001

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:10,720
as lead

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,520
lead audit implementer and

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
certification so and i'm glad

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,879
and during this journey

60
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,599
i had a chance

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,920
a looking for some of the especially

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,959
like say in governance level like some

63
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,520
of the say

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,840
of the best solutions or something that

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
will be

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,640
quite comprehensive and one of such

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,680
things is zero trust architecture

68
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,560
also with all the audience today

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,519
for some i see many professionals that

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,840
some of you thinks will be trivial to

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,519
you but i see also some students and

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,440
that i hope that at least one or two

73
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,959
things will get out of this presentation

74
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,080
uh or even others to get it and or to

75
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
refresh their

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,720
uh knowledge and practice it

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,200
so

78
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,400
risks on cyber security are everywhere

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,239
it's uh

80
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,440
there is an

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,280
anecdotally

82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,599
about a thief a century ago

83
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,280
when the police catched him after

84
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,440
several time after after he

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
robbed the banks and

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,159
they said hey why why the banks and he

87
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,400
said but because there is the money

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,720
and so even today like

89
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
why the

90
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,519
hackers and thieves and bad actors go

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,519
after the data because there is the

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,480
money money today and

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,440
the

94
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,799
risks are another in another side are

95
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,599
because

96
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,480
this

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,159
we

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,560
simply

99
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,920
want to access our systems and computers

100
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,400
and everywhere and with any kind of

101
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,640
devices

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,000
so mobile laptops uh it's uh

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,760
it's a time that i haven't seen in

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,120
offices rarely like uh for

105
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,319
those classical desktops mainly i see

106
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,280
laptops everywhere so they take it home

107
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,839
take it so and they want this kind of

108
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,000
freedom then

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,960
and the the other thing is complexity

110
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,360
all the types of devices all the

111
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,840
uh

112
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,360
so here there is a

113
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,199
number of uh

114
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
number of new vulnerabilities and iot

115
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,040
uh internet of things devices so which

116
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,080
is totally like say relatively new thing

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,800
and

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,040
so huge number of vulnerabilities and

119
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
that's based on ibm report also it's

120
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,919
here based on ibm data average cost of

121
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,759
data breach

122
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,639
it's

123
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,800
for those that they have served based on

124
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,360
their in in index report of

125
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,360
last year it's 4.24 million u.s dollars

126
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,560
while for

127
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,280
u.s companies it's nine mil it's above

128
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,720
nine million uh

129
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,639
dollars so it's uh

130
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,440
and for example uh from i.t governance

131
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,479
report in march have been found 88

132
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,160
publicly

133
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,360
disclosely security incidents for

134
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,840
which account for almost 4 million data

135
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,360
records and that's so for last month

136
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,160
that is like most say recent reports

137
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,280
while for this quarter this uh of uh it

138
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,440
have been 75

139
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,360
million

140
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,600
breached records and that is

141
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,320
what is publicly disco disclosed and

142
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
now we know that

143
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,479
the number of undisclosed is at least

144
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,400
this number of dub or double

145
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,759
and

146
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,600
imagine the number of unidentified

147
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,720
breaches and incidents so it's uh the

148
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,560
risks are everywhere and

149
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,479
so what was the solution

150
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,120
is that uh

151
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
like uh

152
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,199
several years ago it was uh at the

153
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,960
jericho forum in 2004 uh

154
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,880
publicized the idea of the

155
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,280
parameterization uh limiting the

156
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,520
implicit trust based on a

157
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,199
network uh

158
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,960
and

159
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,520
the at

160
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,240
john kinderweg for first research uh

161
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
have coined or first uh say develop this

162
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,240
zero trust model based on the seeing

163
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,440
that uh

164
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,479
seeing that

165
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,520
uh

166
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,160
the devices and what is happening in

167
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,280
network it cannot be trusted anymore

168
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,400
so while there was this saying or it's

169
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,319
still in finance audit trust but verify

170
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,360
so we're low but later we see that some

171
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,840
someone behaves bad then we will cut

172
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,639
access or so on but no with this

173
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,880
approach it's like a

174
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,280
inverse that model directs

175
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,720
it teams

176
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,960
guiding the principle that

177
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,840
don't trust

178
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,560
anyone

179
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,880
we know that traditionally

180
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,319
still there are

181
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,440
networks that within enterprises and

182
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,240
government and elsewhere that

183
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,599
or

184
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,880
that once you see the net network cables

185
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,479
you can plug your uh device and you will

186
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,440
almost be able to see all or to scan the

187
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,520
whole network and you will have access

188
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,280
to most of it

189
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,800
but

190
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,759
with this approach so because so once

191
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,560
you plug it because assume that okay

192
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
you are one of us and you need a

193
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,599
legitimate access so you can uh

194
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,080
you are allowed to uh to access all

195
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,960
those resources

196
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,039
based on this uh say

197
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,199
zero trust elsa google have done beyond

198
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,960
corp uh

199
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,240
developed

200
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,319
had some activities and uh

201
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,160
uh but uh and also in 2020 the

202
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,000
national institute of science technology

203
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,479
of us have uh

204
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,639
developed have developed or published a

205
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,599
special publication on zero trust uh

206
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,080
architecture which is the core of what i

207
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,880
will uh present the next slides uh

208
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,559
there is uh this picture of what at

209
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,559
kindergarten

210
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,640
proposed to seeing that uh all of the

211
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,560
firewalls and uh

212
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,800
wireless gateways and the

213
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,680
and

214
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,000
database encryption are not sufficient

215
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,279
and to move everything uh

216
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,320
uh actually to limit access to all of

217
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,600
those uh within the some zero trust

218
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,000
model

219
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,000
so

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,279
here

221
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,160
i'll

222
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,480
is provided the official uh

223
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,040
uh definition of that their trust

224
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
architecture is an enterprise service

225
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,680
security architecture that is based on

226
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,399
uh zero test principles and designed to

227
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,240
prevent data breach and limit internal

228
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,560
lateral movement

229
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
so zero trusts you heard already from

230
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,000
pranvera in her great

231
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
presentation

232
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,040
and

233
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,680
so she

234
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,120
so

235
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,000
you already got the idea but uh

236
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,560
so as you see here the

237
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,959
one of key things that i see here it's

238
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,160
the limit internal uh lateral movement

239
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,200
as we saw in the previous presentation

240
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
very interesting one

241
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,920
the interesting device and so on it's uh

242
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,800
with those but really we don't have a

243
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,640
chance on security

244
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,360
if it gets into my table

245
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
really i will be

246
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,760
all my

247
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,880
say

248
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,120
all my protections and

249
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,560
bank

250
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
account and

251
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,680
say

252
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,160
social media accounts and the emails

253
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,880
every everything will be compromised

254
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,279
while the idea is that okay i will be

255
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,399
compromised with zero trust uh

256
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,519
let it

257
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,040
say not good for me but it's not uh that

258
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,800
shouldn't mean the end of

259
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,760
the company as well the idea is that to

260
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,399
be limited only on those

261
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,839
to say on my computer and my uh

262
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,040
access

263
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,920
resources that i have so not to be able

264
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,880
to

265
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,160
to the mage across the to across the

266
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,760
enterprise the crisis across the

267
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,880
institution uh wherever i have access

268
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,480
so

269
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,279
zero trust it's a framework so it's uh

270
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,079
not some kind of uh product uh

271
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,720
that you can buy off on the shelf or uh

272
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,440
or

273
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,640
uh

274
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,040
or that can be developed so it's a

275
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,880
framework for securing infrastructure

276
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,440
and data

277
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360
with this principle that organization

278
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,920
should not trust any any entity inside

279
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,160
or outside so it's uh

280
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,959
in their perimeter at any time

281
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,880
so by default

282
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,120
if let's say that i plug

283
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,959
my laptop

284
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,200
over my computer into the network cable

285
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,040
of uh

286
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,760
of a company uh that doesn't mean that i

287
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,000
will have access immediately or vb will

288
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,519
be able to scan

289
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,839
but as you will see later based on uh

290
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,959
access logical access controls so

291
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,440
simply i will not be able to

292
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,800
see anything

293
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,320
and so never trust always verify that is

294
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,360
like say

295
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,079
uh the main

296
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,399
idea or maxime that it's uh followed

297
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,040
through the zero trust uh uh

298
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,959
network zero trust architecture uh

299
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,839
so and to achieve that as the requires

300
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,519
visibility and control over the

301
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,720
environment and users the and traffic

302
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,079
and that is all the time

303
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,839
so

304
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,000
it's set of paradigms that move from

305
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,480
static network based to

306
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,800
that focus on users

307
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
assets and resources and that

308
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,160
dynamically

309
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,880
and

310
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,240
so

311
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,639
the three of uh principles i presented

312
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,440
there so never trust always verify

313
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,639
assume breach so it's uh no matter that

314
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,880
i'm an employee

315
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,800
and have legitimate access and so on uh

316
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,760
still

317
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,720
there

318
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,200
my access all the time will be monitored

319
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,680
and and visible to

320
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,160
during my activity and

321
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,600
implement least privilege uh

322
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,880
we know that

323
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,600
so it's to give the minimum

324
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,680
needed

325
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,839
minimum needed privileges or access

326
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,320
or at the banks as they call it need to

327
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,440
know basis so only for those if i work

328
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,720
at hr

329
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,920
i will have

330
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,839
access only to hr records or

331
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,959
if i work at some let's say that

332
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,600
we are a multinational company if i work

333
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,680
at pristine office in kosovo i will have

334
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,720
only those to those records uh access

335
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,240
and not uh

336
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,160
it's not needed right to be to have

337
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,199
access to

338
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,839
hr records uh for my colleagues in alban

339
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,199
and albania so it's uh let's say

340
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,360
there is we have office there so it's uh

341
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,279
implementing least privilege

342
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,079
for

343
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,720
that is one of uh say principles that

344
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,040
it's being applied

345
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,839
at maybe at other levels or business

346
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,560
processes but to say also at it

347
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,119
processes

348
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,600
that is

349
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,120
say at many corporate softwares that is

350
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,839
regulated uh say by rules and

351
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,480
roles and groups and

352
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,920
but

353
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,000
but still we know that uh

354
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,160
the bad actors usually will be able to

355
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,639
elevate privileges and

356
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,440
through

357
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,320
say

358
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,279
business processes so what we are

359
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,360
what is the zero trust

360
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,920
support is to

361
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,639
to increase it at another

362
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,440
another level

363
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,360
uh

364
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,079
so zeotrust have seven principles

365
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,320
presented here so that data source and

366
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,880
computers computing services are

367
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,360
considered resources

368
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,839
so it requires

369
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,600
it it requires that

370
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,560
all assets

371
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,160
be identified

372
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,880
but at a deep level also like

373
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,199
which process they are for they are

374
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,560
needed and

375
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,800
all are considered resources even uh

376
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,600
even

377
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,839
say external bring your own devices so

378
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,720
our

379
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,600
say

380
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,320
phones and whoever access the network

381
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,040
resources

382
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,279
systems uh

383
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,360
that

384
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,120
is considered a resource all

385
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,600
communication is secured regardless of

386
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,759
network location so no matter if i

387
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,240
access it from internal network or

388
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,560
through externally

389
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,240
no matter if it's left from vpn or

390
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,440
with

391
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,279
multi-factor application and stuff like

392
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,800
that or

393
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,519
as

394
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,360
external let's say that

395
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,839
users internet users of the system

396
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,199
for all those communications should be

397
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,800
should be secured and say

398
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,880
possibly with highest

399
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,360
so let me basically encrypt it

400
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,160
but possibly with the highest standards

401
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
uh

402
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,839
access to individual enterprise

403
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,880
resources great is granted on uh certain

404
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,199
peer session basis so let me that for

405
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,519
example let's say that with that

406
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,720
zero keyboard i get access to

407
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,519
company email and stuff like that or at

408
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,160
some as hr system as i mentioned as an

409
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,399
example

410
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,440
but i need also some extra

411
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,199
i will try to elevate my privileges or

412
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,320
uh

413
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,160
or for some other reason uh uh

414
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,399
also that might be

415
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,199
let's say that for business purposes

416
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,639
might be a load

417
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,880
with some um with uh

418
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,279
with some authorization but uh that will

419
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,600
be per session basis so that in that

420
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,800
case that

421
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,079
or

422
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,359
let's say that it's uh

423
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,000
my account have been hacked or destroyed

424
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,520
or whatever

425
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,199
but uh

426
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,439
so it will be very limited so will that

427
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,720
be will not have access to

428
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,280
let's say or to file server to download

429
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,559
a ban

430
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,039
to download the terabytes terabytes of

431
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,480
data or gigabytes but per session the

432
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,000
the idea is to limit the uh

433
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,720
as the principle assumes a breach

434
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
is even if it's that's happening and

435
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
even if that's happening really it's to

436
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,960
minimize uh to minimize the impact

437
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,640
so access resource that determined by

438
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,520
dynamic policy so there are policies but

439
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,240
those might change based on uh

440
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,880
you know behavior let's say that as i

441
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,480
mentioned uh

442
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,840
for example i access usually

443
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,679
like every day like

444
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,000
30 50 hr

445
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,760
accounts per day or financial

446
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,400
transactions i make and one day i make

447
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,880
200

448
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,678
transactions or access records and

449
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,320
dynamic basis the policies will identify

450
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,039
these issues and will limit the access

451
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,840
yeah

452
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,080
okay

453
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,360
and so that base is based also based on

454
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,880
the fifth principles that enterprise

455
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,039
monitors measured the integrity and

456
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,400
security posture of all owned

457
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,160
and associated assets

458
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,760
uh

459
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,840
the resource altercation and

460
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,280
authorization dynamic and strictly

461
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,760
enforced before access is a load so it's

462
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,360
uh

463
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,400
not

464
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,520
any more simple uh

465
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,400
the username and password but also with

466
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,600
uh

467
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,320
positive this multi-factor application

468
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,640
and as you will see later possibly with

469
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,720
uh say some enterprise

470
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,679
level

471
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,559
over the cloud and uh

472
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,400
enterprise collect as much information

473
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,520
possible with current state uh

474
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,039
network infrastructure and com as it

475
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,679
used to improve its uh security posture

476
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,160
so it's uh uh that

477
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,640
means that uh it will not rely only on

478
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,720
the let's say on

479
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,200
current as we know for example let's say

480
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,679
at uh

481
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,120
firewall rules and antivirus definitions

482
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,280
and stuff like that but

483
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,480
possibly will

484
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,000
evolve with on using this uh

485
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,480
machine learning artificial intelligence

486
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,440
uh

487
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,240
to to learn about the

488
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,520
new dynamics

489
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
for dynamics on

490
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,039
our in

491
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,640
our resource our systems

492
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,600
uh

493
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,320
also there are six defined uh view of

494
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,600
network uh

495
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,440
with uh

496
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
that is with basic uh assumption that f4

497
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,280
connectivity it utilizes zero trust

498
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,799
architecture

499
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,120
so it's uh they are very much linked

500
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,159
with uh

501
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,760
uh

502
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
their implementation is linked with the

503
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
uh principles or seven tenets that's uh

504
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
presented

505
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,520
before so

506
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,600
third for example i like

507
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,120
that

508
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,000
actually all they are important

509
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,799
no resources

510
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,919
inherently trusted so it

511
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,080
does mean that for example yesterday

512
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,600
through this computer i was a legitimate

513
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,840
user

514
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,280
that

515
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,919
today still i will need to authenticate

516
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,080
and

517
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,039
authenticate and uh

518
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,000
and

519
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,200
again for uh for legitimate use of the

520
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,120
system

521
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,400
so it's uh

522
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,840
it's not let

523
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,080
hey save my password and

524
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,880
save my session uh for

525
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,480
like say for forever

526
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,960
uh here's

527
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,440
the logical uh components of the trust

528
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,400
architecture

529
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,280
this is one of the models that by based

530
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,360
on the next proposed model

531
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,840
and

532
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,559
the policy engine and the policy

533
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,919
administrator

534
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,960
that makes uh like the

535
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,159
rules that uh are ortho core that will

536
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,679
allow

537
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,159
the system uh

538
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,120
and to allow the legitimate use of uh to

539
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,000
achieve the level of

540
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,559
trusted to enterprise resources access

541
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,480
and those they are uh

542
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,720
supported by continuous diagnostic

543
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,200
mitigation systems uh industry

544
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,000
compliance systems

545
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,600
gdpr

546
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,720
hipaa and others different standards

547
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
threat intelligence feeds that will

548
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,679
update

549
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,960
not based on the current say threads but

550
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,039
through

551
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,720
the newly detected uh

552
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
say

553
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,640
new detected breaches and stuff like

554
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,120
that will update this information

555
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,960
activity logs uh that will be uh say uh

556
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,919
constantly monitor it

557
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,440
data access policies based on rules of

558
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,200
business cases that will be used uh

559
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,840
cryptography publicly infrastructure

560
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,720
id management about the users and their

561
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,280
identities and

562
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
system information and event management

563
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,320
systems that collect the logs and

564
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,200
visualizes and as well for for current

565
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,000
and for future activities

566
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,320
so

567
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,840
migrating to zero thrust architecture

568
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,720
currently even globally there are cases

569
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,880
where there is a pure zero trust

570
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,679
architecture that can be achieved with

571
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,679
say

572
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,400
if it is green field of or

573
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,840
from the scratch system and

574
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
within a good

575
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
design and

576
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,720
team yes

577
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,159
but uh

578
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,600
more

579
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,640
say commoner hybrid zero transactive

580
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,320
architecture and parameter based

581
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,200
architectures so it's that taking uh

582
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
elements of

583
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,919
zero trust on the current uh say

584
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,880
networks uh to enhance with

585
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,360
zero trust elements

586
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
so

587
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,480
this say also that

588
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
long time was

589
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,400
coined only like in recent years have

590
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,960
been say well documented

591
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,320
also it's uh

592
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,600
say nowadays as a marketing

593
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,400
buzz board is being used by by many

594
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,679
companies

595
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,159
they are just adding this

596
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,159
this product can do

597
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,600
zero trust

598
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,039
and like

599
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,440
bot elements there because as we

600
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,919
mentioned it's not a product but there

601
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,200
are elements that need to

602
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,000
to work at all levels

603
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,400
so it's uh

604
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,559
in migrating to zero trust

605
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,760
assessment it's the key so it requires a

606
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,799
lot of preparation system of inventory

607
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,039
but

608
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,039
what devices we have what they do within

609
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,520
these business processes user inventory

610
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,320
so the users and their roles and and the

611
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,080
business process review that is like i

612
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,480
think the most

613
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,200
time consuming and most critical because

614
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,360
uh

615
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
the business process when they go

616
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,360
through zero trust say because

617
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,960
many cases business

618
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,360
process are designed

619
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,520
with

620
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,559
or

621
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:07,760
also as

622
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,720
i mentioned at the design it's difficult

623
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,520
to design or rarely we see the security

624
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,919
in mind all the time at all at at all

625
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,120
the points

626
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,000
uh so it's business process review

627
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,640
to be identified and to

628
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,400
then to see the risk assessment for

629
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,360
those processes and to start deploying

630
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,760
possibly with small processes

631
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,360
hr again as i mentioned uh to follow

632
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,080
that example might be

633
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,200
like a good candidate for let's say to

634
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,840
pilot within one unit let's see for

635
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,640
office at pristina but and then

636
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,120
to expand the scope and as well we seem

637
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,760
to say organization to expand with other

638
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,640
processes as well

639
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,400
so uh

640
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,120
apart from uh

641
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,960
nist uh the

642
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,760
since i have developed another usa

643
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,640
agency have developed from

644
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,799
the zero trust maturity model and

645
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,400
that is a about identity devices network

646
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,559
environment application workload and

647
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,240
data

648
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,960
i kept the official there official to

649
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,240
say

650
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,240
oops

651
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,520
uh their official

652
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,480
figure

653
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,360
and that is those five pillars are based

654
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,159
on visibility automatic automation

655
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,039
orchestration and the governance and as

656
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,440
i said the

657
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,559
the official figure i saw other figures

658
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,200
and which i would prefer more

659
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
that data is

660
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
at the center

661
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,880
uh through and i think

662
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,159
there where it's

663
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:56,880
and

664
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,960
all the

665
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,039
other pillars are around

666
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,000
around it and of course supported

667
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,960
with visibility analytics and other

668
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,360
elements

669
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,919
yeah and

670
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,080
so

671
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,679
zero trust can be evaluated

672
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,480
so the there's a uh

673
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,799
their maturity model from traditional

674
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,760
where many things are uh

675
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,840
manual policies manual uh setup of

676
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,880
identities and

677
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,600
and management of the data

678
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,039
then

679
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,760
towards the more advanced when several

680
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,159
processes are automatically automated

681
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,320
and

682
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,440
or

683
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,679
automatically through inter let's say

684
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,159
for example cm and

685
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,120
other

686
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,080
inclusion ips ideas systems support

687
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,279
the environment and going towards the

688
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,080
optimal where it's continuous

689
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,480
validation and continue

690
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,000
many things are automatically

691
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,760
through uh support of ml artificial

692
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,440
intelligence and for example newly

693
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,760
extended

694
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,440
extended

695
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,600
detection and response platforms

696
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,440
many challenges are there

697
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,520
but just as valmir saying that

698
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,039
i will here highlight only the

699
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,799
end user training

700
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,159
many see that on new policies

701
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,679
that should happen

702
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,399
if it is with zero trust or no matter if

703
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,520
the

704
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,919
organization has to want to

705
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,720
do the zero trust so end user trainings

706
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,360
and

707
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,679
policies that should be continuously in

708
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,840
uh

709
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,440
nowadays so to wrap up uh

710
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,200
it's uh as is there is a picture of uh

711
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,000
the hurdles uh track

712
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,760
like if i have to run

713
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,960
and

714
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,279
nobody will run through hurdles but will

715
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,960
go all around

716
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,520
all around it so to go faster so

717
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,600
strength of zero trust is that we'll

718
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,120
build

719
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
strong user identification access

720
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,600
policies segmentation of data and

721
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,080
resources

722
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,919
security orchestration remote and

723
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,000
user remote

724
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,159
and and office users are treated the

725
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,120
same

726
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,640
uh limit lateral movements and make make

727
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,320
attacks harder so like in the second so

728
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,039
second picture so we want to make them

729
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,520
harder or like if there was a door

730
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,000
another another idea to put the order

731
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,720
with many locks the idea is that like

732
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,600
our organizations our institutions to

733
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,760
have as many locks or as many hurdles

734
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,640
to

735
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,120
to achieve up to our data

736
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,440
so

737
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,880
and

738
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,039
they will go elsewhere but at least we

739
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,000
will be

740
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,440
protected

741
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,039
okay thanks
