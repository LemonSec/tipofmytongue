1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,560
uh thank you all of you

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,160
my name is

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,679
and today we're gonna talk for a

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,280
keyboard that i make i made some

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,200
modification in simple keyboard that you

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,200
can see it's just a simple keyboard like

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,119
cheap symbol keyboard

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,720
and i named it

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,480
zero keyboard because on it is the

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,720
raspberry pi zero and i'm going to

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,320
explain during this presentation all of

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,760
them

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,160
uh just a short presentation first of

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,640
all that that pixel was not mine so

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,238
don't judge me

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,399
uh my name is castrovito i'm from mitra

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,520
visa that is nearby city here in kosovo

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,440
i'm a cyber security engineer qa

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
engineer as a software developer i've

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
been participating in

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,399
cyber security as i started as a child

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,440
as a 12 years old and novice predict is

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,320
going like 18 years first like a script

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,840
kitty now let's say advanced scripting

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,440
okay what we will talk in during this

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
presentation is what is zero keyboard

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,640
how i made it

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640
uh cost of building zero keyboard

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,320
because the zero keyboard is a keyboard

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,760
that is very

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,640
uh low for low cost top of the attacks

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,360
that zero keyboard can can perform and

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,600
we have a live demo at the end of

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,880
presentation of course q a presentation

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
q a part gonna be

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,720
part of this presentation too

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,200
what is a zero keyboard

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,600
zero keyboard is

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,079
can you hear all of us okay uh

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,720
a zero keyboard is a simple keyboard a

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,960
simple cable keyboard that actually on

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,400
it i haven't planned a raspberry p0w

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,479
this is a raspberry pi that actually you

44
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,200
can control it uh via uh

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,159
wi-fi or bluetooth uh

46
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,320
besides that i have had another another

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,799
device on it that is usb hub just to

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,360
make uh the cabling and all stuff more

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,479
more efficient

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,159
and actually on it i'm running kali

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,560
linux and raspberry pi and actually on

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,880
top of the calling list i have uh

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,200
another framework called pom pi it's

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,759
open source framework that uh enhance

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,600
the raspberry pi to make different types

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,318
of attack like kiss rockets attacked or

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,760
scanning network or all things

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599
zero keyboards this device actually can

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,520
be used for red team engagements and

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,720
physical penetration testing

61
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,760
i added by here but this same is how how

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,800
it look as a final product and uh

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,879
yeah it looks as a normal keyboard

64
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,959
nothing nothing good and actually i'm

65
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
presenting this i'm changing slide using

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,400
it so it's act as a normal keyboard if

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
you don't sign any attack to it

68
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,760
uh the port that i should have been used

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,319
for for uh developing this device is a

70
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,720
simple keyboard with the cable because

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,040
all that is gonna be using usb cable a

72
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,599
usb hub that actually is used to manage

73
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,760
some of the cable inside the uh the

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,599
keyboard raspberry pi zero w uh micro sd

75
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,680
card for operation system or s because

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,920
there are spear raspberry pi w that have

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,959
a internal memory and a usb cable just

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,760
to make some lines inside the

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
inside the keyboard

80
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,920
uh this is a raspberry pi zero is

81
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
actually a very small uh factor a

82
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,680
raspberry pi

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,319
uh this is a keyboard this is a usb hub

84
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,920
that i was using and yeah as i call it a

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,959
simple short uh usb micro usb to 2a

86
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,120
the first step of developing this device

87
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,480
is to the assembly device to go uh to

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,239
the microcontroller that actually

89
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,080
control actually how the hold the

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,560
keyboard uh word actually had has the

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,040
keys on the under the keys or the the

92
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,599
bosses that control when you type any

93
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,480
any

94
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,959
any tasks in the keyboard they're gonna

95
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,560
register what else they're gonna send to

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,280
this microcontroller here and it's gonna

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,640
send to a cable

98
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,400
with a cable to the computer and this

99
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,879
way this is uh

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,280
where things work on it this is a usb

101
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,640
usb hub for four ports and actually what

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
i did i strip it down just to make more

103
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,680
to make more space on it because uh

104
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,959
because when you make this kind of

105
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,879
device yeah yeah you have very tight

106
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,120
spaces on on it and since the cable

107
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,680
of the this microcontroller is long and

108
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,720
the cable and of the usb hub is very

109
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,880
small i need to cut both of them and to

110
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,000
end to realign so just a short

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,680
description about the cable usb cable

112
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
actually have four fins

113
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,479
uh

114
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,120
one is uh the black pin is for ground

115
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,479
the red pin is so for five volt and the

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,880
white and green is for data inverted

117
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,520
data data plus nothing is just

118
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,759
to manage the interference and of the

119
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,919
stops so what i did

120
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,680
here you can see in the microcontroller

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,479
there are four pins actually r5 but this

122
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,960
one the bolt black pin is just a

123
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
isolator pin nothing related to the usb

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,919
or functionality and uh same is with uh

125
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,320
usb hub what you can do you can cut them

126
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,080
and change the cable in and afterwards

127
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
change the cable you can see the usb hub

128
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
not have a longer cable

129
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,479
so after i did that uh this uh next port

130
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,000
was to implant the raspberry pi usb usb

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,479
hub and to line it with the with the

132
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,479
microcontroller so

133
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,759
this is the

134
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,120
the us usb hub that has this cable and

135
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,400
this cable is going to go to the

136
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,120
computer and this is the uh

137
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,039
microcontroller of the keyboard and

138
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,160
actually i'm linking it to the usb hub

139
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,080
this is a raspberry pi that has a

140
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,039
cabling going to the usb hub and what

141
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,800
happens when you plug it in computer

142
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,639
actually you plug your usb hub that

143
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,680
actually

144
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,160
give over to the two devices to you to

145
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,240
the keyboard itself and to the raspberry

146
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,880
pi that is inside the keyboard and the

147
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,360
next steps in part of the building is to

148
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,039
assemble and make it

149
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,960
like this

150
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,280
but in my case when i plug it in that

151
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,160
work why did that work because the plate

152
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,199
between the raspberry pi le keys

153
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,280
is metallic

154
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,960
and if you don't oscillate it they're

155
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,199
gonna make sure circle on raspberry pi

156
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,039
so what i did i

157
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,000
just laid uh put some isolated tape on

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,880
top of it just to avoid the

159
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,479
the

160
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,440
short lines electronic short lines

161
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,240
there actually i haven't uh developed

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,520
any any anything from a solver but i i'm

163
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
using kali linux as a simple phone

164
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,280
operation system for raspberry pi and on

165
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,080
top of that i am running this framework

166
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,000
that is pompei it's open source

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,080
framework you actually everyone can find

168
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,039
in the

169
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,759
github and it enhances raspberry pi and

170
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,919
have a nice web interface that you can

171
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,800
configure every device like every

172
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
component of the raspberry pi like

173
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,919
inputs

174
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,440
uh wiffy uh bluetooth connection and all

175
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,800
of them i will explain some of the

176
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,960
features in live demo that we are having

177
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,800
after so

178
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
then this one is uh the cost of building

179
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,919
it actually is very low cost i have

180
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,840
bought this uh keyboard that actually

181
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
you can see right now for 10 years

182
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,160
before three or four years maybe now

183
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,319
it's cheaper it says your simple usb

184
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,039
hubs of course phi raspberry pi actually

185
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:17,840
i

186
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,520
bought raspberry pi for three two years

187
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,000
ago now maybe the prices are lower

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,520
and as as the court and simple simple

189
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,720
cable just for wiring and

190
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,960
wiring tape just to make some isolation

191
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,720
in order not to avoid the short circles

192
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,960
uh because this keyboard has implanted

193
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,680
that uh raspberry pi uh w uh zero w that

194
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,560
actually is a micro uh microcontroller

195
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,280
that

196
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,879
has bluetooth

197
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,080
and uh

198
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,680
and v on it besides that actually it has

199
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,599
a usb cable that can connect with the

200
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,680
computer and can mimic

201
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,520
some of the behaviors that some of

202
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,599
devices like you can use as a usb

203
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,240
internet you can use a serial usb you

204
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,319
can use the mass storage you can mount

205
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,879
the storage actually that is part of the

206
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,400
as the cord

207
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,120
as a remote disk you can use as a

208
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,280
keyboard uh

209
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,720
as a keyboard and and the mouse

210
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,599
having all these features you it can

211
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,160
make uh enable you to to perform

212
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,759
different types of attacks one of them

213
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,879
is keystroke injection using vpo

214
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,440
bluetooth another one since uh is going

215
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,599
to live in the same network that when

216
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,599
you are playing placing it actually you

217
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,640
can do scanning like uh network scanning

218
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,919
using usb internet vp or scanning for

219
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,919
nearby bluetooth devices pretty much

220
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,120
everything that you can do with the

221
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
raspberry pi outside the outside the

222
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,320
keyboard and another type of attack that

223
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,720
you can do it uh since you have

224
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
it connected to storage you can extract

225
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,399
data from the device from the devices

226
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,200
when the usb the keyboard is connected

227
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,080
and send it to the internal port in

228
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
raspberry pi and after that you can

229
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,160
connect to the raspberry pi using vv and

230
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,560
extract to your computer so it's like a

231
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,200
pivoting from one to another device this

232
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,120
is also uh uh of port of attacks and and

233
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,440
how i build and actually i have a simple

234
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,200
demo that uh i will do a like demo uh

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,680
the the demonstration is that of this

236
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,160
demo is doesn't have to do with the how

237
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,720
advanced the payload is or or how well

238
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,360
the payload is crafted but uh more to

239
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,880
see how open is

240
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,200
this device to to developers and

241
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,440
security engineer to develop any type of

242
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,120
any type of payload they can be used

243
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,959
i have make a simple diagram just to

244
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,399
explain how how this uh how this uh

245
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,880
payload work actually this is attacker

246
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,120
using a phone it can connect via

247
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,680
bluetooth or vp to the keyboard and

248
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,440
after that the keyboard can send

249
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,880
keystroke injection uh uh to the to the

250
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,440
computer and the keystroke injection

251
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,800
gonna open run as part of the windows

252
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,279
operation system is going to execute

253
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,959
powershell commands that download and

254
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,000
execute another powershell script that

255
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,399
from a server that

256
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,560
after that over stages to to grab the

257
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,600
malware executing computer decode decode

258
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,480
all the uh passwords saved in chrome use

259
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,320
smtp to send to the email and actually

260
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,560
the attacker can can go to that email

261
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,600
and see see there see the

262
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
credentials starting from from the

263
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,079
computer now support when i will i will

264
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,440
do a live demo

265
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,480
and for a demo

266
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,560
since we are we have just

267
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,199
one screen

268
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,040
i

269
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,320
am attacking it from my mobile device

270
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,120
so

271
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,160
i

272
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,839
i'm mirroring it using

273
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,640
using this application

274
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,240
okay

275
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,480
can you see the screen of the yeah i

276
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,360
think

277
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,120
you can see

278
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,839
and one of three requirements is to to

279
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,680
have a v connection on the computer

280
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,600
because we're going to download the sun

281
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,279
payload to it so

282
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,560
one of my friends have shared this

283
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,480
hotspot and i'm connect internet

284
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,640
actually i can connect

285
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,600
uh using the okay just to test if the

286
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,160
internet is working

287
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,720
yeah it's working

288
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,519
so

289
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,760
uh

290
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,600
that are gonna be from formula mobile

291
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,399
device and as you can see

292
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,360
the

293
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,880
the keyboard keyboard actually have a

294
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,640
hotspot you can connect it and actually

295
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
have been connected to that maybe you

296
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,120
can see here the zero keyboard is a

297
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,360
hotspot that actually the keyboard is

298
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,399
connecting

299
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,760
and you can go to this ip this you can

300
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,839
decide at any any type of ip you can

301
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,680
configure it's just to have a web

302
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,079
interface and some of the things that

303
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,720
you can set on keyboard is the product

304
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,160
id uh manufacturer name product name and

305
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,800
serial serial number and this is gonna

306
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,360
kind of bypass the type of uh uh

307
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
prevention system that most of bank use

308
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
maybe are young ariana can explain most

309
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,440
of banks using

310
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,000
at the domain controller they add that

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,480
trusted device with a serial number but

312
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,800
what you can do you can spoof the id of

313
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,519
the serial number okay and can add here

314
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,680
actually i'm not going for to any

315
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,519
feature that pom pi actually has i'm

316
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,040
just going to the port of the keystroke

317
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,200
keystroke injection can happen i have

318
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,560
created that saved one one of them here

319
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,480
and actually this is just a simple

320
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,920
powershell script that download and

321
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,639
execute with any code so

322
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,519
how we can run it just click run

323
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,600
it's gonna open powershell let's reload

324
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,519
this for from a perfect so daniel please

325
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,920
don't judge my powershell script

326
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,000
and yeah actually

327
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,079
what what happened he said in the

328
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,600
background it's gonna download the

329
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,480
malicious file and all of that i'm

330
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,519
disconnected it from my v

331
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,040
and i'm going to my gmail

332
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,279
yeah a lot of friends are

333
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,200
typing right now

334
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,079
and

335
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,839
here we have email maybe you can see the

336
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,639
timestamp it's

337
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,560
11447 just one minute ago and you can

338
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,480
see here all the current stuff that are

339
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,639
getting from the chrome if your one

340
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
proves i can open the chrome

341
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,959
and going

342
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,760
to settings

343
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,560
passwords

344
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,959
and here you can see

345
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,560
this is the same i'm not decoding it but

346
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,839
actually is the same

347
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,320
the same username

348
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,839
credentials on it

349
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,680
too so pretty much this is all
