1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,879
about the compliance

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,200
it's all the rules

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,679
regulations laws

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,799
it's

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,199
how the organization controls so

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,680
three of them make the

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,000
performance of organization

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,880
three of them make good governance and

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,000
three of them make the i.t security if

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,519
three of them are met together and are

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,040
well together

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,239
than there we will gonna have in our

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,680
organization i.t security

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,440
i tried to

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,239
show you some definitions and with

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,200
representative pictures about each one

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,399
of them what is governance is having in

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,600
your hands everything in control of your

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,039
organization

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,120
and i focus on the governance of i.t

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,760
the governance is ethical management of

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,920
organization with approved business

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200
plans and strategies governance means

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,880
transparency means ethics and it means

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,159
the monitoring of your organization

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,520
hand risk

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,880
i choose again another picture to

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
represent the risk the management of

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,439
risk management of risk it's

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,400
the balance that you should

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,439
keep in mind when you're deciding how

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,119
much risk you should take and

33
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,680
how much risk you should keep it in your

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,119
organization

35
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,600
why is that because if you mitigate all

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,640
the risk then it means you can isolate

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
your organization

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,520
and that doesn't mean performance so the

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,840
management of risk means good

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,560
performance and compliance compliance it

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,000
helps both of them

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,719
managing the risk and governing

43
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,479
with the compliance

44
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,240
the organization

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,600
has all the regulations all the

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,679
procedures policies

47
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,760
and the way it monetize

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,000
and no come the one that goes further it

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,879
goes deeper as the iceberg

50
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,080
it goes deeper in three of them it

51
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,840
audits

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,040
make sure and provides that three of

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,800
them are met

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,519
and three of them are functioning well

55
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,160
with it audits in general with the

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,680
audits you make sure that your level of

57
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,519
organization it's in good performance

58
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,239
that's the definition of it audit it's

59
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,800
investigation and evaluation of i.t

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,040
systems infrastructure policies and

61
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,640
operations

62
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,080
so with it audit you will

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
make sure that your

64
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,800
organization it's functioning and in

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
control

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,800
but

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,480
it's not what penetration testers do

68
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,000
let's not confuse both of them i.t of it

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,440
makes the risk

70
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,840
management and evaluates the risk and it

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,959
works

72
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,720
with risk assessment and not a 100

73
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,840
percent

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,239
penetration testing and

75
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,080
making sure that

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,920
every part of the

77
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,159
organization works only the critical

78
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,120
parts

79
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,440
based on risk

80
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
i know who i'm gonna

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,239
talk more about institutions of republic

82
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,159

83
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,519
which i may

84
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,640
say a lot more about them because i have

85
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,879
a very

86
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,680
much experience almost

87
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,000
more than eight years working on the

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,560
institutions of republic of kosovo

89
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,680

uh

94
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,040
in the beginning as well in in 2000s in

95
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,319
the early 2000s uh institutions of

96
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,120
republic of kosovo has been focused

97
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
mostly in

98
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,399
development developing

99
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,720
systems and infrastructure and

100
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,680
functionalizing

101
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,440
electronic services for citizens

102
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,560
but they haven't thought about

103
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,960
making a structural

104
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,199
organization and

105
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,400
laws and policies until 2013. that's an

106
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,040
event of 2013

107
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,560
even if in early 2000s they started

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,960
functioning lots of systems and

109
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,720
electronic services in 2013

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,680
assembly of republic of kosovo has

111
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,120
implemented

112

and developed the law on information

113
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,360

which are the bodies that manage

115
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,639
every

116
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,400
it determines

117
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
the units

118
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,840

and it has the most of

135
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,639
data and systems

136
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,880
organized

137
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,160
inside this institution and as well with

138
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,199
its agencies the biggest one with the

139
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,000
largest data and the most critical data

140

of the main

146
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,639
agency and it's the centralized

147
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,400
part of the i.t in kosovo it says it is

and collaborates together with ais

160
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,080
that's

161
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,599
the two main

162
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,319
institution for governance and now i

163
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,319
choose the other two for

164
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,360
risk

165
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,919
which are regulatory authority of

166
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,120
electronic and postal communications

167
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
which works

168
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,160
under the law for communications and the

169
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,880
main unit of this regulatory its

170
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,680
national computer security unit or

171
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,039
cossart

172
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,599
key role for this

173
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,240
unit is safeguarding of electronic

174
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,080
communications networks and services and

175
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,560
