1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,540
okay so hi everyone thank you for

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,240
joining us today in our presentation

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,860
it's an honor for me to be here mainly

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,840
for two reasons I was a student

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,420
obviously of this University and also

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,460
this is the first time speaking in a

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,740
conference so I would like to personally

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,740
thank Aryan and dardan for uh and the

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,180
whole besides theme for giving me the

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,800
opportunity to present here in front of

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,359
you today

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,180
we are discussing about a very delicate

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,480
subject which is the uh attack which

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,000
struck Maersk uh in 2017.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,920
this is me

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,920
I am currently working as a devops

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,020
engineer at Buckaroo payments I recently

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,719
joined them it's been like three weeks

19
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,100
uh I'm passionate about cyber security

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,320
obviously because I'm presenting here

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,160
today

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,920
and I I'm a local Ambassador for crowd

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,840
Tech they were part of b-sides last year

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,360
they couldn't make it this year but uh

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,559
they are basically uh an open source uh

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,100
company which offers IPS IDs firewall

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,900
and many integration with different

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,560
software for for uh the protection of

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,040
your servers and so uh I do love working

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,460
with AWS I do that daily but as many

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,920
people don't I don't like Azure I want

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,140
to point that out and I also enjoy

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,939
making memes so you're going to see a

34
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,259
couple of them during the presentation

35
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,299
so let's get to it

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,979
today we're talking about ransomware

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,720
we're going to have like a brief

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,939
introduction of what ransomware is many

39
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,340
of you are familiar with it but anyway

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,720
we're going to give like a short

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,420
description uh just to see what of what

42
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,880
type of malware it is uh how does it

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,020
work and so on and uh we're also going

44
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,540
to specifically talk about a very

45
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,140
special type of ransomware which is not

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,579
petia which is uh what attacked Mars in

47
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,360
this case also we're going to talk about

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,258
Maersk itself uh just to see uh what

49
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,660
type of company it is and why is it so

50
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,660
important to mention them in this case

51
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,920
and then we're going to talk about the

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,459
day where when Maersk meets not petia

53
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,060
which was very unfortunate and also uh

54
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,640
we're going to see at the we're going to

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,500
stop at the aftermath of the attack just

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,260
to see what the casualties were and how

57
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,140
everything unfolded it and ultimately

58
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,640
what's important

59
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,260
we're going to look at the lessons we've

60
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,080
learned from this attack

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,900
so what is a ransomware uh Kaspersky

62
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,660
defines it as an extortion software that

63
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,280
can lock your computer and then demand a

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,800
ransom for its release so basically what

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,560
happens a ransomware is a form of

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,739
malware which basically encrypts your

67
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,379
data and then says I want some money in

68
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,000
exchange of that if you want like the

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,640
key to decrypt it and yeah basically

70
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,599
that's how it works usually the

71
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,280
encryption algorithm algorithms that are

72
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,420
used are unable to be decrypted without

73
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,360
having the the key

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,519
and this is why it makes almost you know

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,019
impossible to decrypt without without

76
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,800
having uh the private key in this case

77
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,560
it also spreads spreads rapidly on the

78
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,300
network which is also what happened with

79
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,019
not petia and usually the payments uh

80
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,360
are required to be done in crypto

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,400
because you know of all the reasons we

82
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,739
already know it's untraceable it's

83
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,019
easier to to make those payments and so

84
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,080
on and so forth so forth so what does it

85
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,140
actually look like to be attacked by a

86
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,360
ransomware I really want to emphasize

87
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,000
this I really hope none of you sees this

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,260
screen we're going to present next

89
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,680
because it's already too late for you

90
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,319
this is the screen that is usually

91
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,799
presented to the persons that uh have

92
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,220
been attacked by a ransomware so

93
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,159
basically it gives a description of what

94
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,620
has already happened it says that your

95
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,120
hard disk of your computer has been

96
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,159
encrypted military grade encryption

97
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,440
algorithm we're gonna see on the next

98
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,019
slide how that works it says that there

99
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,760
is no way to restore your data without a

100
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,740
special key which is a private key on

101
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,860
asymmetric encryption

102
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,380
and it says that to purchase your key it

103
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,720
usually instructs you to use a tour

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,180
browser or as we know the onion routing

105
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,900
protocol and uh you need a tour browser

106
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,139
to actually access uh the links that

107
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,620
they usually provide as you've seen uh

108
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,919
and also you need to like enter your

109
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,080
personal decryption and then they will

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,360
send the key back what happens most of

111
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,639
the times is that even if the company of

112
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,520
the person sends a payment they will be

113
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,620
like yeah you paid this but you need to

114
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,840
make an additional payment and so on and

115
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,540
so forth so it's usually not recommended

116
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,699
to send payments if this happens

117
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,639
unfortunately uh if you don't have a

118
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,580
backup it's non-recoverable but if you

119
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,380
have a backup in place you can just

120
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,419
simply restore that backup and have your

121
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,840
files back

122
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,540
so how does it work basically the victim

123
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,940
uh acquires around somewhere from email

124
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,120
an exploit warm whatever type of source

125
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,520
and then the rest somewhere contacts the

126
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,180
attackers uh control and command server

127
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,479
so what happens is a public key is used

128
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,479
to encrypt the data on your machine and

129
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,180
a private key is stored on the command

130
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,520
and control server so it means without

131
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,680
that private key it's impossible to

132
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,440
decrypt your data data is encrypted and

133
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,080
a ransom note which in this case is this

134
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,960
one is presented to the victim and then

135
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,419
after the ransom is paid the attacker

136
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,699
sends private key to decrypt the data

137
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,100
but please be aware that that is not

138
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,820
always uh the case sometimes even if the

139
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,940
payment is made as we mentioned uh

140
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,979
probably you will not get your data back

141
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,380
we are going to focus on a special type

142
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,259
if we can call that ransomware and I'm

143
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,919
going to elaborate more on that shortly

144
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,780
it was first detected in

145
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,380
2017 and it was primarily spread through

146
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,720
medoc now what is medoc it's an

147
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,900
accounting software which is based in

148
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,800
Ukraine and the Damage that not patio

149
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,039
cost to uh companies all around the

150
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,440
world is estimated to be around 10

151
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,120
billion 10 billion dollars

152
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,699
it's a variation of petia which is where

153
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,500
the name originates so petia is

154
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,840
basically a ransomware which originated

155
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,240
before not petya so this is like a

156
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,979
variation of that ransomware and we are

157
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,800
going to see the differences that it has

158
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,360
uh

159
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,680
in comparison with Petra it used to ex

160
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,300
it used two exploits which are very uh

161
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,180
popular uh one of them is eternal blue

162
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,120
and it used a special tool which is

163
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,340
called mini Cuts we are going to see

164
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,160
what these two do shortly

165
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,520
and ultimately it was labeled as a cyber

166
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,380
weapon and this is for the reason

167
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,419
because it is believed that this was

168
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,560
created by Russian hackers and the main

169
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,639
reason it was created it was to attack

170
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,160
uh companies organization Banks and

171
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,860
everything that were located in Ukraine

172
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,000
so unfortunately for Maersk uh it was

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,280
just collateral damage because Maersk

174
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,280
was never the target so what happened is

175
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,560
that uh the Cyber weapon was created

176
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,400
because of the geopolitical uh war that

177
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,680
was happening between Russia and Ukraine

178
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,720
and basically

179
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,220
uh in this case Maersk was uh attacked

180
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,039
by uh not petia but it wasn't the main

181
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,259
target

182
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:15,360
so how does notepadia uh actually go

183
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,300
into uh different machines or

184
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,319
organizations uh the first variation is

185
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,720
that it goes through the medoc update

186
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,199
server so this means that not petya was

187
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,580
uh

188
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,059
coupled together with me Doc and as soon

189
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,099
as you would get an update so in this

190
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,500
case it means that it used me Doc as a

191
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,240
backdoor to actually go into the

192
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,279
infrastructure this is what happened

193
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,899
with Maersk and uh uh the other way of

194
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,180
actually going into the systems is using

195
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,519
is using fishing males for example if

196
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,220
you have like an infected document and

197
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,220
also uh for example if one of your

198
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,220
machines uh on the local network let's

199
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,820
say is uh is infected it can also spread

200
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,820
through the internal Network and

201
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,140
ultimately

202
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,420
this is what is called lateral movement

203
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,600
uh Swiss army knife which means it's a

204
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,820
compilation of tools multiple tools

205
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,980
which is also what a Swiss army knife is

206
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,000
and for example uh it uses let's say for

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,860
example Eternal blue anemical just like

208
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,320
we mentioned earlier it uses that to

209
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,959
spread rapidly across the network which

210
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,099
is what happened in this case

211
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,200
so the most striking feature of the

212
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,120
notepad around somewhere is that it is

213
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,980
not a ransomware I'm sorry to disappoint

214
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,420
you I know that the name of the

215
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,000
presentation is uh not Patty ransomware

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,800
but it is not a ransomware the

217
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,959
developers had no intention of ever

218
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,839
delivering a decryption key this means

219
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,260
that uh the main focus of this attack

220
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,560
was to destroy data and uh this is why

221
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,320
it made the data non-recoverable for

222
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,420
example uh

223
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,120
if you take a comparison between this

224
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,760
and let's say the wannacry ransomware

225
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,040
which happened months before the

226
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,500
notepadia The Internship the intention

227
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,540
of Wanna Cry was to actually encrypt

228
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,760
your data get your money get your data

229
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,740
back this was not the intention of not

230
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,860
bad yeah it was purely data wiping and

231
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,220
destruction

232
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,620
let's talk about mursk which is the

233
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,320
victim in this case it has its

234
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,740
headquarters in Copenhagen uh so that is

235
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,420
where the attack initially happened and

236
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,820
then it spread uh across the global

237
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,760
infrastructure that Mars uh has in place

238
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,940
it is the world's largest shipping

239
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,180
company uh because it it estimated that

240
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,860
they transport around 12 million

241
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,440
containers every every years and in 2022

242
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,420
they had a uh revenue of 81.5 billion

243
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,880
dollars and the reason for this is

244
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,040
because of the you know containers

245
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,839
prices going up and up but yeah

246
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,360
basically you can just see how big of a

247
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,200
company it is so it has

248
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,320
574 offices in 130 countries

249
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,300
all of them were infected in this case

250
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,779
even the backups that they had even the

251
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,700
offline backups everything was infected

252
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:24,140
when the uh not petia ransomware struck

253
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,120
let's unfold the attack

254
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,320
it happened on June 27 2017.

255
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,079
at four o'clock in the morning

256
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:36,000
ransomware attack on Ukrainian Banks

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,220
power companies and as you can see a

258
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,680
pattern here Ukrainian that's mainly

259
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,459
because uh let's say the entry point of

260
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,060
uh not petia was medoc so whoever you

261
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,660
was using me dog and uh got the update

262
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,560
from uh their server they were actually

263
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,959
getting notepadia into their systems

264
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,600
together with that update at 11 30

265
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,180
Ukraine Central Bank confirms attack on

266
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,740
ID systems same attack with not Patia

267
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,360
at 121 Mars publicly confirms that the

268
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,459
it systems are down

269
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,300
at 612 Kaspersky says that not patio

270
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,240
wiper we have to focus on this because

271
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,540
as I mentioned the main focus was to

272
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,660
wipe and Destroy data and it has already

273
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,740
affected around 2000 organizations

274
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,220
at 7 46 Ukraine police confirms me dog

275
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,540
is infected by not petya but uh they

276
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,339
said that it's not our fault in this

277
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,380
case because it was initially thought

278
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,300
that they were actually conducting the

279
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,680
attack but that was not the case they

280
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,399
were just infected uh the source of this

281
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,860
information it's uh

282
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,399
from Charlie ponnell which had a case

283
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,579
study on the uh mersk not tattoo attack

284
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,779
yeah that started uh this might seem

285
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,700
like a joke but it is not this is what

286
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,040
actually happened the way they describe

287
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,519
it if you were looking on the hall all

288
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,620
the computers was just like going black

289
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,620
black black and there is like a strong

290
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,820
reason for that

291
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,860
this is not patia's recipe for

292
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,940
catastrophe if we can call this that way

293
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,700
initially as we mentioned medoc was

294
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,000
infected so the malware itself came from

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,040
a trusted Source nobody would think that

296
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,600
if you just update your accounting

297
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,899
software in this case mersk was using

298
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,380
medoc for tax returns in the UK sorry in

299
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,360
the Ukraine country

300
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,420
so the source for them in this case it

301
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,399
was trusted they had no idea that they

302
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,620
could be infected from their accounting

303
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,880
software

304
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,540
the second one is encrypting mft which

305
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,519
is the master file table we're also

306
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,240
going to take a look at that uh it takes

307
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,940
very

308
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,560
uh it takes less time to actually

309
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,440
increase encrypt the mft in comparison

310
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,139
to actually encrypting all the files on

311
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,820
the systems we're going to stop at that

312
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,940
uh on the next slide

313
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,519
rapid propagation was also a feature

314
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,459
because it is it is said that it only

315
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:30,180
took uh several minutes to a couple of

316
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,279
hours for the whole Global

317
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,820
infrastructure of Mars to go down

318
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,000
they also had this fatal combination of

319
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,940
different tools and exploits to actually

320
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,860
achieve this which we are going to see

321
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,639
how they actually did that

322
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,500
so the back door the software used by

323
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,839
the finance teams for tax returns as I

324
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,639
mentioned it was compromised by not

325
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,839
petia

326
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,839
in this case automatic updates were

327
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,959
enabled which if you look at it it's not

328
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,180
something really strange because we also

329
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,240
have automatic updates enabled in our

330
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,120
different apps and we would never think

331
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,120
that the ransomware would actually

332
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,820
originate from that

333
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,980
in June the virus was pulled inside the

334
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,260
ID infrastructure and is propagated

335
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,680
inside the network I'm going to get back

336
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,500
on the slide and just reason just just

337
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,760
elaborate on one thing

338
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,399
this command and control server which we

339
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,440
earlier mentioned for example if you

340
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,060
want to cry around somewhere this

341
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,639
connection between the uh

342
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,040
machine that was attacked and the

343
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,600
command and control server never

344
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,480
actually happened so the encryption key

345
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,519
that was used by notepadia it was sent

346
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,940
to an email but that email was blocked

347
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,760
by the machine so it never reached the

348
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,519
attacker's machine which renders the

349
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,339
files unusable and also the operating

350
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,540
system in this case

351
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,360
encrypting mft I'm going to take on a

352
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,120
practical example for this

353
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,740
let's say you want to go into building

354
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,839
and you're looking for a specific

355
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,160
compartment

356
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,980
instead of let's say encrypting all the

357
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,620
names of the apartments on the doors

358
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,860
you simply remove the map which is at

359
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,199
the entrance of the building this is

360
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,079
what happened with mft instead of going

361
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,019
and encrypting all the files one by one

362
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,779
what they did is they encrypted mft

363
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,800
which is the master file table inside

364
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,560
NTFS which is the file system used by

365
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,860
windows in this case this rendered the

366
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,800
whole operating system unusable what

367
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,500
this means is that this is a table that

368
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,620
includes information about where your

369
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,680
files are so this for example let's say

370
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,639
for a 500 gigabytes a hard disk this is

371
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,300
merely uh some some megabytes so it

372
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,400
encrypted so fast and this is the main

373
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,359
reason why it was propagated so so fast

374
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,720
across across the the machines to do

375
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,780
this they used a special tool which is

376
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,260
used mft to CSV so basically they just

377
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,640
encrypted the mft master table and the

378
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,619
whole operating system was rendered

379
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:30,120
unusable except that they also had a

380
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,820
special module integrated which also

381
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,740
wiped the data on the machine

382
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,039
so rapid propagation was done mainly

383
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,380
using Eternal blue which you might have

384
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,940
heard of

385
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,880
Eternal blue is an exploit which was

386
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,100
used by NSA it was used for more than

387
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,900
six years they never reported it to

388
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,880
Microsoft because they had to you know

389
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,220
they wanted to use it for their uh for

390
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,620
their uh exploitations

391
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,340
so they used Eternal blue uh which in

392
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,799
this case used the vulnerability of of

393
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,940
the SMB V1 which is a protocol uh used

394
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,840
in Windows for uh file and resource

395
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,600
sharing on the network so Eternal blue

396
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,120
use that vulnerability to spread across

397
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,280
the network and what's very interesting

398
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,380
is that this attack as we mentioned

399
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,980
happened in June 2017 the patch for

400
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,980
Eternal blue was uh released a couple of

401
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,100
months I think it was March March 2017.

402
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,620
so they could have passed this but that

403
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,600
does not necessarily mean that this

404
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,280
would not happen because they still used

405
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,340
extra tools to actually propagate

406
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,020
through the network which is for example

407
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,720
the PS exec also mini cuts and also a

408
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,400
bunch of different tools to actually

409
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,559
both encrypt the the data and also

410
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,679
spread uh across the network this is how

411
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,039
many Cuts looks like it's a tool that is

412
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,640
used also uses vulnerability to extract

413
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,980
passwords from the memory on devices

414
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,780
that are running Windows

415
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,799
example of PS exec we run a command on a

416
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,720
machine with a simple command with

417
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,780
ipconfig and as we can see it returned

418
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,320
the IP of the device that we were

419
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,900
actually running this on so this is just

420
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,179
one of the tools that notepadia had

421
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,299
incorporated into their uh malware in

422
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,820
this case and uh the combination was

423
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,820
just uh fatal for mask in this case

424
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,179
the aftermath of the attack uh okay

425
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,919
initially they had to work on pen and

426
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,700
paper which imagine if you have several

427
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,220
hundred offices spread across the world

428
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,140
they couldn't even use their phones they

429
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,260
couldn't even alert uh their colleagues

430
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,120
that this was happening and that is

431
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,820
mainly because also their servers that

432
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,559
they used for uh telephone

433
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,220
Communications were rendered unusable an

434
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,860
estimated 49 000 laptops were destroyed

435
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,160
the financial cost was around 300

436
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,400
million their backups were infected they

437
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,320
had to shut down operations on multiple

438
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,539
ports

439
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:20,880
they had several day of inaccessible I.T

440
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,940
infrastructure and uh yeah it took them

441
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,679
about four weeks to get like a full

442
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,039
operational I.T infrastructure

443
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,160
and obviously they had to rebuild all

444
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,919
the servers and all their PCS and yeah

445
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,919
it cost them a lot both financially and

446
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,840
it is also important to uh actually

447
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,539
emphasize that it was uh

448
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,820
it damaged their reputation a lot

449
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,299
because uh you know it's a big company

450
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:54,660
spread all around the world so basically

451
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,480
uh they had some good communication if

452
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,919
we can say so with their clients

453
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,320
partners and stakeholders but at the end

454
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,840
of the day I mean uh it's not good that

455
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,360
this happened to such a big company

456
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,720
this was posted on the mercs Maersk I.T

457
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,760
systems uh they public publicly accepted

458
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,860
uh that their ID systems were down which

459
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,080
is quite uh you know unfortunate

460
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,220
and uh

461
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,919
yeah the lessons we all learned from

462
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,860
this attack it was unfortunate for mersk

463
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,440
to have this attack but nowadays it

464
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,919
serves as a lesson for all the companies

465
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,860
institutions uh and also individuals

466
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,980
that uh you always have to prepare for

467
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,440
the unpredictable which in this case was

468
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,520
also uh the case with mercs because as

469
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,980
we mentioned the actual ransomware came

470
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,980
from their accounting software

471
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,659
first of all companies need to

472
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,059
prioritize their security Investments

473
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,919
because this is crucial for a normal

474
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,760
operation especially since uh the whole

475
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,360
management and business continuity of

476
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,000
mursk in this case was based on their ID

477
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,260
infrastructure

478
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,659
they need to add robust backup and

479
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,120
Disaster Recovery systems even though

480
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,500
they had this in this case unfortunately

481
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,020
it couldn't be of help for them

482
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,299
it's important to have a comprehensive

483
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:29,760
cyber security plan

484
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,280
they did as we mentioned have

485
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,380
transparent Communications with their

486
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,220
customers and also with uh the

487
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,039
stakeholders and their Partners but that

488
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,980
didn't really came to help as much and

489
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,539
also up-to-date configuration of the

490
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,840
systems which is crucial uh one thing

491
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,659
that I want to mention is that they

492
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,059
could have used sandbox environment to

493
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,980
test their uh software because it just

494
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,380
even if the ransomware would go inside

495
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,179
the systems if you have like a Sandbox

496
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,880
environment the virus would just spread

497
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,260
there and not like in the whole

498
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,720
infrastructure which in this case

499
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,740
happened with mersk and uh ultimately we

500
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,140
can close with a quote most experience

501
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,000
with not petia serves as a stork

502
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,100
reminder of the need for robust cyber

503
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
security measures in today's

504
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,200
interconnected world

505
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,470
thank you for joining this presentation

506
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,059
[Applause]

507
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,620
if any of you has any questions I would

508
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,299
be happy to answer them

509
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,900
yep

510
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,220
so thank you very much for the

511
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,360
presentation

512
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,179
um to be honest I remember when the

513
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,980
Eternal blue exploits got clicked by

514
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,900
Shadow Brokers and was a really

515
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,559
challenging time for everyone

516
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:01,559
I was just curious I'm not sure if you

517
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,260
like where let's say investigated

518
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,419
something similar because some of the

519
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,240
attacks actually affected Albanian uh

520
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,240
like uh institutions and not many like

521
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,460
and also I probably console as well

522
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,039
because they were not

523
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,460
bounded by boundaries and if I remember

524
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,860
correctly if you actually didn't restart

525
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,980
the computer the mft would be fine so if

526
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,960
you've shut down the computer and didn't

527
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,539
start up uh

528
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,520
if you didn't just restart it

529
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,620
automatically the MFD encryption was

530
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,500
only happening on Startup so it was like

531
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,299
a way to actually avoid the entire

532
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,100
problem happening but it was too late

533
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,919
because everything was done so I'm not

534
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,700
sure did you encounter that in real life

535
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,720
or uh was just yeah good question

536
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,840
because I was also asking myself uh this

537
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,720
very question but the thing is uh I also

538
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,200
mentioned that uh except having the MST

539
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,020
encrypted they included this module

540
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,600
which actually wiped all the data so it

541
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,880
wasn't just the MFE so they had like a

542
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,460
second thinking plan which even if they

543
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,320
don't restore the computer this module

544
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,720
that was incorporated inside the uh

545
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,880
notepad around somewhere actually made

546
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,820
it possible for all the files to be uh

547
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,840
wiped out even if you for example would

548
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,940
not restart your computer which happened

549
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,620
in this case because you know the the

550
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,020
whole file system was destroyed by the

551
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,559
second module that not petia uh used but

552
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,419
what you're saying is correct but they

553
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,279
also had this second thing implant which

554
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,640
uh they wanted to make this uh you know

555
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,440
as successful as possible in this case

556
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,240
yeah I'm just curious because

557
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,400
I heard people actually talk about that

558
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,900
but like the same books that we had

559
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,900
didn't destroy uh didn't have the wiper

560
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,940
features so I'm not sure it was like the

561
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,799
wiper feature was only like specific to

562
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,720
a region or not but yeah it was really

563
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,059
interesting to actually see an example

564
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,400
that had the wiper version but yeah

565
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,559
really interesting

566
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,840
um I would say you can use the mft to

567
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,720
CSV on your laptop and you can try it no

568
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,000
no I mean actually I mean the vipe the

569
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,580
wiper coaster we're gonna have to talk

570
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,380
with the Russian hackers if they can

571
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,100
provide it for us

572
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,919
do we have more questions

573
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,200
okay yeah

574
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,980
great presentation thank you and I

575
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,740
actually didn't look much into that

576
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,559
because by that time I if I'm not wrong

577
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,140
I just started school so you know I was

578
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,220
yeah

579
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,220
I was not working so uh do we have any

580
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,100
estimation of companies that did pay for

581
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,039
that and how much you know extra costs

582
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,799
were were done you know for for paying

583
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,260
because as you said and as I've heard

584
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,960
not only did they not have a decrypter

585
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,539
but also even if they sent something it

586
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,100
was not allowed so do we have any

587
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,919
estimation on how many companies did pay

588
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:06,600
and how much they did

589
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,520
well uh

590
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,740
actually they weren't unable to pay at

591
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,000
all because

592
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,159
the red screen that I showed you that

593
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,380
was an example from the wannacry

594
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,480
ransomware and that is like a different

595
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,159
subject because they want to cry around

596
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,380
somewhere operates different from

597
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,100
notepadia but there is an estimation of

598
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,919
how much damage did not pet your cost to

599
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,380
all the organizations specifically for

600
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,520
mersk it was around 300 million dollars

601
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,000
but they had this uh let's say cyber

602
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,760
security Insurance in place which

603
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,340
actually made it a little bit easier for

604
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,640
mersks to actually come back uh

605
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,059
financially if we can say

606
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:53,039
but for the other companies it was

607
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,200
around 10 billion dollars because this

608
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,020
included banking systems and different

609
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,419
companies especially the ones which were

610
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,059
located in Ukraine because that's where

611
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:06,000
it all actually started

612
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,820
okay uh and another thing

613
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,659
since this was uh the Wanna Cry screen

614
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,299
do we have aside from the Eternal blue

615
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,400
and the fact that that it's uh it's

616
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,419
around somewhere do you have any

617
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,580
correlation any any links in the code

618
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,539
between them so is the the bug that

619
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:28,080
Wanna Cry had the domain bug present

620
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,980
here in this I I I'm asking because I

621
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,080
haven't looked at those those codes so

622
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,740
do you know uh well actually what is

623
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,159
known is that they did use eternal blue

624
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,320
to propagate through the infrastructure

625
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,960
of nersk and all the other companies

626
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,320
that were infected in this case uh also

627
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,440
there are other tools and exploits maybe

628
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,020
the exact number is never actually known

629
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,640
because there were so many tools they

630
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,860
just wanted to make this work so I

631
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,919
unfortunately I wouldn't be able to know

632
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,799
for sure that but we know that they had

633
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,400
just enough in place to make this work

634
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,120
okay thank you thank you as well

635
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,279
any more questions yeah we have one more

636
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,700
question there

637
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,399
by the way I do appreciate questions

638
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,980
because it's making me walk around the

639
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,059
menu

640
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,919
I had like so much food so I'm gonna

641
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,520
burn some calories

642
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,720
uh hi so right now we are learning about

643
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,240
data security and all the different

644
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,659
malwares including ransomware's so my

645
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,580
question would be how can we ensure that

646
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,460
our University remains resilient in the

647
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,159
face of evolving ransomware threats and

648
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,500
also let's just say worst case scenario

649
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,380
we do get a ransomware threat and how

650
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,539
would we ensure that our backups are

651
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:57,419
secure and let's say up to date yeah

652
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,179
good question first of all in terms of

653
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:03,120
uh being protected by the ransomware in

654
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,700
this case it's crucial to have cyber

655
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,299
security sessions for both the staff and

656
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,399
the University students because this

657
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,860
will allow them to actually identify the

658
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,380
potential threats where ransomware could

659
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,159
originate from uh and uh also it's

660
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,080
important to have all the systems up to

661
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,559
date because for example uh if Mars were

662
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:28,320
to update the vulnerability that was

663
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,659
related to Eternal blue I'm not saying

664
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:32,279
that the attack would not happen but the

665
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,679
impact would be less than what they did

666
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:37,820
in this case second thing about backups

667
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,679
I mean in this case unfortunately even

668
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,559
though they had offline backups it still

669
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,279
managed to go through the infrastructure

670
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:49,320
but uh you know one of the strategies

671
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,220
would be to have these backups uh in

672
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,340
multiple places and ensure that they are

673
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,919
done in timely manner so in this case

674
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,020
they they even if this would have

675
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,980
happened

676
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,260
they would be able to actually restore

677
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,260
them what's really important to know is

678
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,760
that for example if you're talking about

679
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,159
server backups which is where they store

680
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:13,380
their data or their applications that

681
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,600
would be the case but it would be harder

682
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,299
to actually back up each and every one

683
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:20,340
of the laptops of the employees which

684
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,260
immersk had in this case

685
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,419
thank you thank you for the question

686
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,460
any more questions great presentation

687
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,760
