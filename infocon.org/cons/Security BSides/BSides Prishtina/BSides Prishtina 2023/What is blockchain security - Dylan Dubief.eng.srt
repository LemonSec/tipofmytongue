1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,600
okay thank you so hello everyone and

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,240
welcome to my blockchain security talk

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,300
uh before we start just a quick

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,620
introduction

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,920
so I'm a French Wonder manager I'm doing

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,340
uh hacking since uh why you know since

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,380
I'm getting older every years like

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,660
everyone

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,880
most of my friends know me from my world

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,340
project

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,740
I'll just like doing a screen injection

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,120
by voice recognition or implementing a

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,239
Vertex coffee pod control protocol to

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,719
make a remote

15
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,760
if you still have to work to grab your

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,079
coffee

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,719
useless button

18
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,559
I'm also doing some more science stuff

19
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:54,559
mostly with Bishop Fox since two years

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,920
this is a nice job with very cool people

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,160
of course the best of them are here

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,140
today so

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,400
let's talk with us if you want special

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,040
thanks to dadan for the conference and

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,799
to the world beside the team

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,619
and if you want to reach out after the

27
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,200
torque here is my Twitter and Linkedin

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,360
uh before we already start talking about

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,780
blockchain uh just few disclaimers we

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,880
are just talking about what we are not

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,420
talking about

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,520
so we are not talking about tokens value

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,500
because it doesn't matter

34
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,960
we are not talking about investment

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,259
because I have no idea or to invest so

36
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,000
if you want to be rich don't listen to

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,119
me

38
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,759
uh all the what are supposed to be

39
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,759
digital art or these nft things with a

40
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,799
dirty monkey we are not talking about

41
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,200
that Nifty technology was not made for

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,700
that at first

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,479
and if we think about scam pamper and

44
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,640
fishing

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,380
it's only interesting when you are doing

46
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,758
investigation

47
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,280
so we're not talking about that

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,280
what we will discuss is uh or the secure

49
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,160
aspect of a blockchain and a blockchain

50
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,440
application

51
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,500
and the main purpose of this work is to

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,379
bring the interest in the offensive

53
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,680
consultant and every curious people

54
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,780
uh to the blockchain side so maybe we

55
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,879
will have more people to work with even

56
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,679
if that means less on this

57
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,519
so

58
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,260
now let's transfer uh the main question

59
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,140
because on the internet you can read a

60
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,780
lot of things about blockchain but most

61
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,940
of the people talking and writing a book

62
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,340
blockchain just can't answer this

63
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,200
question

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,300
so let's install this question very

65
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,519
quickly before we start talking about

66
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,340
Security even if a blockchain is all

67
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,200
about security

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,780
sub blockchain is just a distributed

69
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,980
database

70
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,099
with a specific functionality it solves

71
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,560
trust issues

72
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,920
the issues solved by the blockchain

73
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,620
exist since a while more than 40 years

74
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,680
it was presented in

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
in the 18th uh

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,540
mostly known as a business Engineers

77
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,220
problem

78
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,680
to make it short the general business in

79
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
this program is about a

80
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,200
sending transmitting information when

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,080
you know some of your assets some of

82
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,200
your node or some of your general are

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,840
compromise and not and can't be

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,959
addressed

85
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,659
in the business option and generous

86
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,620
problem the story is if you have an army

87
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,379
with General and you want to attack your

88
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,340
target you need to use your general to

89
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,040
to send the same order to your world

90
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,180
Army

91
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,780
so if you say to your general to attack

92
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,660
your opponent and one of your general

93
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,320
decide to call for retweet you will just

94
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,820
lose the battle

95
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,040
this is the first issues solved by

96
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,120
blockchain and other consensus

97
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,620
Bitcoin was one of the first

98
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,940
implementation of the business

99
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,460
infiltrations of the wizard engine

100
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,639
Awards program called as a business

101
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,380
inflictorians solution

102
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,259
the first proposal of a solution a

103
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,020
solution was

104
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,479
mostly mathematical to reach our

105
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,280
consensus that allow you to

106
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,380
to keep your system working even with

107
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,460
interested assets you you need 3n with

108
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,900
one

109
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,680
um

110
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,660
trusted assets with m al the compromise

111
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,720
asset

112
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,479
with Bitcoin uh this is

113
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,419
um not episodeinforterent implementation

114
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,300
as it was present at this time it was

115
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,440
reworked it was improved so we reach our

116
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,919
constances of the 41 percent that mean

117
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,400
you need one n plus one

118
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,160
trusted asset process node to reach the

119
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
consensus and be safe when you are

120
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,099
transmitting information

121
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:38,759
um

122
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,759
it wasn't solving all the issues uh

123
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,199
Bitcoin

124
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,840
involved other issues like the accurate

125
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,539
power the electricity etc etc

126
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,960
so other people try to develop new

127
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,660
consensus and here comes the proof of

128
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,360
Stack etc etc

129
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,740
the problem is the issues is

130
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,479
proof of Stack at proof of work don't

131
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,340
serve any issues

132
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,460
so people continue to work and other

133
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,759
consultant so today we are

134
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,960
here

135
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,840
this is not only resulting for torrent

136
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,759
this is not only proof of work this is

137
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,580
not only profile stack this is a bunch

138
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,340
of consensus and algorithms that solve

139
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,840
the trust issues in different situations

140
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,120
for instance the proof of work a week

141
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,680
right here a token to reward people

142
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,620
providing their Ash right power but you

143
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,240
can face a Byzantine problem without

144
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,960
um

145
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,600
having to provide a token or anything

146
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,020
there is tokenless blockchain that don't

147
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,380
involve token money or this thing you

148
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,240
have professional activity proof of

149
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,620
capacity

150
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,400
and even a mix of a few of them

151
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,979
so this is a more complex subject

152
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,680
and this is not about what you can

153
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,060
see on internet on

154
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,880
non-technical paper this is about

155
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,340
algorithm uh

156
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,160
data transmission

157
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,099
trust and cryptography

158
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,340
so for this torque uh we are not talking

159
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,340
about order consensus because we clearly

160
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,440
don't have time to talk about all of

161
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,660
them

162
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,660
we are we will cover all the aspects of

163
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,740
the production

164
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,520
but this expression uh we answer one

165
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,240
question

166
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,900
if in your system you don't need to

167
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,660
solve a Byzantine problem you just don't

168
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,699
need a blockchain at all

169
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,599
so even in your daily life you speak

170
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,880
with people you want a blockchain in

171
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,120
their product for a new observation you

172
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,860
just have to ask them do you need to

173
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,680
solve the first issues pictures as a

174
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,380
business problem if not they don't need

175
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,120
a blockchain at all

176
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,400
and even less a cryptocurrency

177
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,660
well

178
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,199
no we have a solution a consensus to

179
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,919
solve trust issues but that's not

180
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,430
enough to provide

181
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,720
[Music]

182
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,020
real technology we need uh decentralized

183
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,759
application

184
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,700
so after a few years

185
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,740
we started to see some new blockchain

186
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,099
that become application host

187
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,000
with the smart complex technology

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,339
so before we start about vulnerabilities

189
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,279
and other stuff we need to understand

190
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,779
the what is a smart contract

191
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,019
basically a production

192
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:59,899
is just as I say a super cheap database

193
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,300
stored in a multi node with the same

194
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,320
state

195
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,640
the blockchain is another name explained

196
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,000
action of block with data

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
if you can store data you can store

198
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,420
source code

199
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,959
or code or IC or any kind of code

200
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,279
so

201
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,340
if you are

202
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,820
[Music]

203
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,180
a code store on a blockchain powered by

204
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,320
a node why not just call node randomly

205
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,080
to execute code and let the console

206
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,540
switch decide of and solve all the trust

207
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,700
issues

208
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,440
and this is all we got this first

209
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,440
blockchain with smart contracts with

210
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,260
decentralized application when the user

211
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,620
only had to call some nodes randomly

212
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,300
because the console switch solves the

213
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,300
trust issues and we're able to execute

214
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,360
code and do some do some stuff

215
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,779
but at this point at this point we still

216
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,940
have an issues

217
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,060
that looks pretty obvious

218
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,279
at this point we have no ethernet

219
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,820
interface so the first blockchain it was

220
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,100
just some developer with blockchain

221
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,080
Smart Control knowledge and helping with

222
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,420
the blockchain doing some stuff but it

223
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,240
was pretty Limited

224
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,279
so they find a kind of a solution and

225
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,320
here is how we come to

226
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,160
world world

227
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,899
so web3

228
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,200
or when I prefer to call the web 2 plus

229
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,800
one layer because this is absolutely not

230
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,839
an improvement

231
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,540
uh there is a schema of the reality you

232
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,760
have the blockchain with your load your

233
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,279
data your code and some dirty website in

234
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,560
front

235
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,860
to create your web 2.1

236
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,839
of course you have a legit website

237
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,959
mostly made by developer who publish the

238
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,660
smartphone right but you have also a lot

239
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,399
of other

240
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,240
not so legit website

241
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,959
and here we come with a website problem

242
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,779
first all the trust issues served by the

243
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,880
blockchain is just

244
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,940
destroyed by the website because the

245
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,880
user will just connect to our website as

246
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,459
centralized every website controlled by

247
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:36,540
just one person or a team of developer

248
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,140
but with the websites who will interact

249
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,540
with the blockchain execute the smart

250
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,880
contact that you have no ID of what is

251
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,640
inside your your website so

252
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,000
all the work made around the conferences

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and solving the byzantines program are

254
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,220
just useless when you are using a single

255
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,820
website to interact with your blockchain

256
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,060
and this is not the only issues this is

257
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,339
the biggest one because the blockchain

258
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,380
just become absolutely useless with a

259
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,579
website but

260
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,019
will impact your users because if our

261
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,600
website is compromised because of Any

262
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,760
usual vulnerabilities

263
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,459
users connecting to the website are

264
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,740
likely to lost their private keys are

265
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,760
likely to accept transaction they are no

266
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,760
clue they have no information about

267
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,959
so

268
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,300
now you have the consensus

269
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,279
vulnerabilities you have the smartphone

270
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,079
request vulnerabilities uh all the

271
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,440
issues solve ISO consultances are

272
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,720
destroyed by the website but you also

273
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,360
have the website issues affecting your

274
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,200
environment

275
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,180
and with all the people building R1

276
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,820
blockchain without worry knowing what is

277
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,180
a blockchain you can find some web stuff

278
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,680
like some private key unique privacy we

279
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,220
will own by one person

280
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,620
running a world project with a lot of

281
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,100
money inside stored in clear text in

282
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,820
some S3 packets VPS or other dirty

283
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,180
server

284
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,079
so what was a strange at first uh like

285
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,940
the smart portal allow everyone to build

286
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,760
our own because the decentralized

287
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,740
application made by the smart contract

288
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,620
allow people to answer every people to

289
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,139
interact with the smart contract so

290
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,060
everyone can build around

291
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,660
become a threat because even if anyone

292
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,700
can build

293
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,399
it's clear that anyone shouldn't build

294
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,839
around

295
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,480
and most of security consultant and

296
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,639
potassium no wire

297
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,040
so

298
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,180
let's see uh real use case of what uh

299
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,959
our website vulnerability can look like

300
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,139
last year I was looking around doing

301
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,899
some research because I was tired of all

302
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,019
these defy things or all this thing I

303
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,079
would finance and money so I was looking

304
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,279
for some new project more real use case

305
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,360
so I was trying to find some interesting

306
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,639
game using blockchain

307
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,139
ym because in my port of view game

308
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,760
blockchain cam makes it can make sense

309
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,260
for a game

310
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,260
if there is gamer here you will probably

311
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,199
know why

312
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:51,079
especially if you are into LPG or

313
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:53,220
strategy game

314
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,399
a decentralized application can be

315
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,680
interesting when it's come about

316
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,139
Community when you come about in-game

317
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,899
markets when it come about competitive

318
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,860
game or a lot of things and you guys you

319
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,270
can use a blockchain to run

320
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:10,620
[Music]

321
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,540
um

322
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,420
gaming ecosystem without involving a

323
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,060
single cryptocurrency blockchain is not

324
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,540
about money so you can use uh for

325
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,519
instance

326
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,740
any gaming company social Blizzard or

327
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,620
anything or even online for for the

328
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,420
people who know this game

329
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,820
can have a private blockchain with

330
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,740
public node with

331
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,300
um

332
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,180
we used by your just player to continue

333
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,000
to build around the game and make the

334
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
with the Game grow with the community

335
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,740
that's why I'll start looking for a game

336
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,839
uh I was quickly disappointed because I

337
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,880
didn't find any interesting game

338
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,639
but in our security point of view I

339
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,620
found some

340
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,079
the first game I did this was a Flappy

341
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,639
Bird like

342
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,920
it was on a web app a mobile app

343
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,480
with just the usual Factory Bird game

344
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,000
all world was a Nifty with some

345
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,699
characteristics to deal with score with

346
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:22,560
exchange competition Etc

347
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,880
not very interesting

348
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,579
so industrial point is the team start to

349
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,800
make some context with real money

350
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,899
involved in price Sports

351
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,459
so

352
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,820
if you know there is a game published

353
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,800
with a daily contest with money involved

354
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,579
what could could go wrong

355
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,579
of course it will be attacked because

356
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,820
every day you can earn money

357
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,339
spoiler on the story The Smart contact

358
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:59,339
was not the issues

359
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,820
so what was this game

360
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,660
as every competitive game mostly when

361
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,020
it's it's involving a prize pool with

362
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,179
money

363
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,799
you will attract boots

364
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:21,240
to cheat and go to competitive game and

365
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,359
be ranked without doing anything

366
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,819
if you want to know more about voting

367
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,640
game you have the perfect work tomorrow

368
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,240
for the game every day you had five

369
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,760
thousand dollar

370
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,860
in price pool every day

371
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,960
eighty percent of this happened was

372
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,419
distributed among the top five players

373
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:46,160
so it was an easy way to make a decent

374
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,160
uh daily amount of money

375
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,679
and as a Target outside of a smart

376
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,919
contract we had a JavaScript web app a

377
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,140
mobile app for Android and iOS

378
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,340
the fact the reality of this game is

379
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,660
after only two days of launch

380
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,240
a dedicated team from sankapur

381
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,039
already finished to build about to

382
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,640
attack the game the team will build this

383
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,740
game was only focused on the Smart

384
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,720
Control acts of the

385
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,160
um was only focused on the smart

386
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,100
controller the crypto currency Etc so

387
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,020
when they publish the first version of

388
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,860
the game

389
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,100
the game didn't had any

390
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,120
um antibod on teach IT solutions inside

391
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,980
the source code

392
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,580
so it was an easy Win Thursday they

393
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,919
published the game I did some

394
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,799
communication people start to play ways

395
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,820
the second day it become popular the

396
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,299
third day the full top five was owned by

397
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,799
the Singapore team

398
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,140
and ultimately get grabbed by support

399
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,160
team

400
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,860
so they try to click to quickly answer

401
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,980
the problem and develop some antibod

402
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,900
solution but

403
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,419
developing antibod solution is a real

404
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,380
world works you can improvise

405
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,400
so the next coming days was mostly the

406
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,260
team

407
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,419
updating the project

408
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,299
pushing some antibods called Direction

409
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,480
production to stop the building

410
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,200
and on the other side the Singapore team

411
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,860
updating their bot to bypass the patch

412
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,100
so the team got angry is start to ban

413
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,039
all the birds

414
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:44,039
on know your metrics so we're just like

415
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,440
I am sure this guy is cheating so let's

416
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,340
burn the birds

417
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,580
we had like twenty thousand dollars of

418
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,400
damage with all the users of goodbye for

419
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,360
no reason

420
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,240
it was a complete for

421
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,400
people who was crying in company and

422
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,700
Community it was kind of find from my

423
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,220
point of view at this point I was just

424
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,700
curious I started to infiltrate both the

425
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,240
bot team and the project team I was at

426
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,640
the point I had an accountant Discord on

427
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,400
the both team getting access to some of

428
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,520
the code of the Bots

429
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,620
and the other side they got me a

430
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,260
moderation permission from the team and

431
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,440
the Discord to manage what the support

432
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,080
for us so I was just in the middle of

433
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,720
everything looking with uh

434
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,460
I wasn't robbery that was just having

435
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,419
fun for me so

436
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,940
I spent few days getting information

437
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,280
okay that's the code from the boat

438
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,620
located at the solution proposed by the

439
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,280
project team and I

440
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,760
didn't find any solution so

441
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,440
before leaving this story I am just ID

442
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,740
to do something just for fun it was kick

443
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,980
so both team from the top five find a

444
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,640
way to be first and just uh beat the bot

445
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,480
so as every pen tester I'm start I start

446
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,580
looking at every piece of the project

447
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,640
developing a boat was

448
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,240
not Micron because first I'm too lazy to

449
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,980
build a boat for this kind of game

450
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,440
secondly it was JavaScript I can do

451
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,960
JavaScript but I don't like it so I'm

452
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,020
not gonna develop a bots in JavaScript

453
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,960
so I start to look at the Smart contract

454
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,400
didn't find any comment vulnerability

455
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,340
both on any technique or all the contact

456
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,820
undering the tokens the money

457
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,580
it was pretty safe they had um what we

458
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,860
call a code wallet this is a smart

459
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,860
contact only order token and

460
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,200
who are doing only one action

461
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,080
so it was kind of a security by

462
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,480
Simplicity oriented but I didn't find

463
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,080
any way to get anything from the

464
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,000
contracts

465
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,100
in the same way I didn't find the

466
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,220
private key say properly store it in a

467
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,360
sexual way real financing so I start

468
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,580
testing the Android Android app because

469
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,120
I like Android

470
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,980
IOS app at all because I don't even have

471
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,780
an iPhone

472
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,140
so after doing some tests I found the

473
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,960
app has no root detection so you can

474
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,780
root your app doing something like this

475
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,480
uh they don't care no certificate

476
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,400
pinning so you can intercept every

477
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,700
request between the phone and the game

478
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,220
uh but I don't find any interesting that

479
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,620
I have stolen to the phone except your

480
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,940
own wallet

481
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,120
but anyway I don't want to put my wallet

482
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,900
on my phone or do this kind of stuff

483
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,280
uh so I started to look for another way

484
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,159
and that's why I didn't spoke about the

485
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,140
web app yet

486
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,220
so I did what I'm doing almost every

487
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,799
week I launch burp

488
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,960
start to intercept all the requests

489
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,419
between my browser and the game

490
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:25,500
and I quickly found that there is not

491
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,120
that much request

492
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,820
I found one interesting request when you

493
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,000
launched the game with some call to

494
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,539
check your wallet check your build ID

495
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,100
and

496
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,320
stores the data inside Java JavaScript

497
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,480
and after that even with the

498
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,720
interception on you can play the game

499
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,940
without being interrupted

500
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,179
and when you complete the game when you

501
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,860
lose you have

502
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,840
a final request

503
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,140
this request

504
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,760
it was very simple you have no

505
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,159
authentication at all the first request

506
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,799
getting your build ID information from

507
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,480
your wallet was

508
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,120
provide on the router with the score

509
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,760
no authentication no permission control

510
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,059
nothing just calling what they call an

511
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,580
API I'm not even sure we can call that

512
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,059
an API this is just a post request

513
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,340
sending your board ID

514
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,740
and the score

515
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,480
so if you want to be first

516
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,820
what should I do

517
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,720
just simply send a request every day one

518
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,820
second before the end of the contest

519
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,179
just getting the top payer score and

520
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:48,120
adding adding one and sending the

521
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,399
request and that's it you win

522
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,880
so just with this request uh the both

523
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,700
team was out of the top one I just so

524
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,480
um yeah so I did the test once uh wasn't

525
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,240
very interested by doing this every day

526
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,760
and storing the money I was just curious

527
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,640
entering to to beat the bad team so it

528
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,980
was pretty successful

529
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,179
um

530
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:21,000
so at this point the result was or the

531
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,940
security was on the smart contract side

532
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,340
the game was just a client-side

533
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,100
JavaScript with no authentication at all

534
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,980
it was very game

535
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,659
um

536
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:36,539
the both team did lost a lot of time

537
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:39,360
because I still I'm still trying to

538
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,580
figure out why they did so much

539
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,460
development to have about when they you

540
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,080
just have to send a request to win the

541
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,419
game

542
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:51,059
and that's it there is a lot of work to

543
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,539
do for having a Warrior game in my point

544
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:57,840
of view this is not even a bit at game

545
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,140
in beta test this is just a proof of

546
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,779
concept or oh you can make a game with

547
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,640
the blockchain

548
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,200
using real money for this is is a is a

549
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,240
shame

550
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,659
wait

551
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:18,020
yeah perfect

552
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,539
um so

553
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,360
the point of the story was just to show

554
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,600
you uh that even if you don't know uh

555
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,419
Auto Pro to develop smart contract you

556
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,760
can still be involved in blockchain

557
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,179
security because a lot of people

558
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,700
are directly doing dirty thing around

559
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,640
the blockchain so you can have fun you

560
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,279
can find some interesting stuff if you

561
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,159
have a junior open tester this is also a

562
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,080
good way because you are going to find

563
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,080
some vulnerabilities we didn't buy since

564
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,020
20 years

565
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,620
so this is heaven

566
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,679
this is like uh doing some training in

567
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,039
some challenge website uh you have the

568
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,900
people doing smartphones are then that

569
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,740
build uh some

570
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,919
up of this Smartphone right

571
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,000
um

572
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,640
this is also a good way to stop to learn

573
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,320
smart contract because when you are

574
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,720
going to analyze all these projects are

575
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,820
working just you will start to

576
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,480
understand uh all the technology bi the

577
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,240
smart contracts used by this project Etc

578
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,640
so it's a good way to start if you want

579
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,940
to learn or to do some pen test or

580
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,080
backbend tea

581
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,880
but

582
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,220
at the point you will you will you are

583
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,080
going to want to

584
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,360
to test the smart contracts you are

585
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,460
going to do some augmentation

586
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,679
and there is a platform for backbending

587
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,539
for smart contracts and the Ubuntu are

588
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,580
pretty juicy because with a critical

589
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,179
Ubuntu you can earn like Alpha million

590
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,880
for a single critical Bundy so

591
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,460
can be presented interesting

592
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,419
but before you you launch yourself on

593
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,900
the smartphone these things you need to

594
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,500
know few things

595
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,400
smart portraits are public and

596
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,220
at the moment you publish your code is

597
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,039
it's at risk everyone can read the code

598
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,980
if the code is not easily readable you

599
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,039
still have the Hope code so there is

600
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,659
always a way to understand what the

601
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,700
Smart Control is doing

602
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,120
everyone can interact with everything so

603
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,340
it's like being attacked at every second

604
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:46,980
and even if you shouldn't test in

605
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,340
production most of the bug Bunty Target

606
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,020
magnet

607
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,140
the mail net is equivalent of production

608
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,419
so this is a

609
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,299
everything you are going to do we will

610
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,440
have an effect

611
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,380
and with blockchain and smartphone

612
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,860
products

613
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:09,960
all the thing you are going to do can be

614
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,240
undone when you launch your attack when

615
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,799
you

616
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,840
try something

617
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,279
since you launch our attack it's too

618
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,559
late to go back

619
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,799
and here we go to what I call the devops

620
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:30,000
199 technology methodology

621
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,380
a few years ago a very big project with

622
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,440
uh 300 millions of dollars inside

623
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,720
[Music]

624
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,720
issues

625
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,020
on GitHub a user just come

626
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,500
open an initial and GitHub and anyone

627
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,380
can kill your contracts when you kill a

628
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,399
conflict

629
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,760
you don't destroy the data when your

630
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,340
data is on the blockchain it's the

631
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,919
instruction but if you kill the contract

632
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,260
it will lock the contract everything

633
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,539
will be terminated nobody will be able

634
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,159
to interact with it everything will be

635
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,360
locked

636
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,279
so this guy devops 199 open issue

637
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,919
heading to the this big project that

638
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,559
anyone is able to kill the products

639
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,500
while you're waiting foreign

640
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,630
[Music]

641
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,080
to the issue

642
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,779
I accidentally hit the contract the

643
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:38,360
contract

644
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,059
so the guy was just doing some tests he

645
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:44,159
looked he opened the issue because he

646
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,860
was worried and while testing he

647
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,080
accidentally triggered the function to

648
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,179
catch the contract and then the contact

649
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,480
got locked and all the money got lost

650
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,899
so just because I don't know I forgot to

651
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,559
comment online

652
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,940
or on the exploits it just locked 300

653
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,659
Millions after all

654
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:14,279
you know I I guess you can understand

655
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:18,360
why uh the name on GitHub is Ghost and

656
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,720
not devops for people without no Gus is

657
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,399
the name you got on GitHub when you

658
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,939
delete dragons

659
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,240
as well after that

660
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,100
anyways

661
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,440
this

662
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,279
is a kind of overall Story We Tell to

663
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:44,399
new tester to African because we don't

664
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,740
want this thing to happen again

665
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,380
and I don't want to be responsible of

666
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,840
this kind of thing I don't want to be

667
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,659
covered uh because of a mistake became

668
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:58,799
the most hated hated man of the world

669
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,179
so I start to draw a checklist of things

670
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,720
I should do to avoid this kind of issues

671
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,059
first protect yourself

672
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,100
you need to use dedicated wallet or

673
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,080
smart contracts because when you

674
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,760
interact with a contrast you are going

675
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,659
to to send some authorization

676
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:20,399
to give some permission to interact with

677
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,880
the contracts so there is malicious

678
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,360
contract you have honeypots when you

679
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,880
sell a notarization to this contact you

680
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,500
can have some little piece of code

681
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,080
hidden that will install everything from

682
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,539
you if you interact with the contract

683
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:40,220
so don't do the testing

684
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,640
because the projects are verified but if

685
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,220
you are doing it while testing just look

686
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,860
at it onto that contract and trying to

687
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,679
do some tests use the dedicated wallet

688
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,039
so you are you will not lost anything

689
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,659
uh

690
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:01,020
on your car you or you will always need

691
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,600
to double check the addresses I will

692
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,320
explain you why in a in a few

693
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,440
you also need to add the authorization

694
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,960
control and withdraw and transfer

695
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,320
function to avoid to lock your phone

696
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,460
because if you manage to exploit

697
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,880
availability to store the token for good

698
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,880
purpose like a good white ads and you

699
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,340
plan to send the money back

700
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,980
it's not a good idea to store the money

701
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,860
in a more vulnerable contract than the

702
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,039
previous one so you you will have to be

703
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,140
careful of the way you are doing your

704
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,760
tests

705
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,080
to be honest

706
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,340
I did uh uh make I did made some mistake

707
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,179
when testing fortunately it was only on

708
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,419
training labs and test environment

709
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:58,200
so I didn't affect anyone but I have

710
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,380
some surprise and this is scary

711
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,239
long ago I was training on the job defy

712
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,859
this is a lab you can use to learn or to

713
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:16,800
pair or to exploit green lab smart

714
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,379
contracts so I was working on it just to

715
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,659
learn a new way to to export smart

716
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,639
contracts because there is a lot of

717
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,460
different vulnerability

718
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,080
it takes a lot of time to understand or

719
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,918
to

720
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:31,580
to to

721
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,560
just to make a lot of time to learn all

722
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,980
these vulnerabilities so I was dealing

723
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,560
with one of the challenge

724
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,599
this is a simple contract

725
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,239
this is open number one you have three

726
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,119
function one to deposit token one to

727
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,020
withdraw token and one to do flash loan

728
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,659
a flash loan is a function that allows

729
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,960
you to borrow tokens perform operation

730
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,020
you can execute and do anything you want

731
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,560
with the token as long as you send back

732
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,380
the same amount of token at the end of

733
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,820
your operation

734
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,880
so you have to borrow the token do all

735
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,940
the operation you want and send the

736
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,560
exact amount back

737
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,619
in a one cycle

738
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:23,660
but this contact was vulnerable

739
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,280
to experience the variety quickly on the

740
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,540
flashlight function you have

741
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,140
a variable at the beginning that will

742
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,420
store the balance of the contract before

743
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,079
the loan then uh

744
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,540
you can borrow the token and execute

745
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,220
anything you want

746
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,859
and at the end you have a require this

747
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:49,920
is a condition check

748
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,339
that will control if the balance of the

749
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,880
contract after your question is equal or

750
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,619
above the balance before

751
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,820
the probability is here because there is

752
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,480
some subtleity in the deposit function

753
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,180
when you deposit token you still have

754
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,240
the ownership of the token

755
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,940
so the contracts the loan function is

756
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,800
checking the balance of the contracts

757
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,040
and not the ownership of the token

758
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,140
so to perform your attack

759
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,000
you just have to call the flashlight

760
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,660
function

761
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,599
will trigger your execute function

762
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,240
on this execute function you have one

763
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,660
thing to do just deposit the token you

764
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,240
just borrow so you ask the contract to

765
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,119
give you some token and in your execute

766
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,740
function you deposit the token

767
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,440
and you stop your execute function

768
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,440
when your Galaxy function hand you

769
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,440
trigger the condition check so the

770
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,079
contracts will check his own balance

771
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,960
since you deposit the token the

772
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,700
condition there are met and everything

773
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,400
can be run as expected

774
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,339
but it's not because you close your

775
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,500
execute function that you are stopping

776
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,839
your action after closing your executive

777
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:20,640
function and deposit the token your

778
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,460
attack function can withdraw the token

779
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,920
you just deposit because you still have

780
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,980
the ownership since it's a deposit

781
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,859
so the condition is met but you can

782
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,680
withdraw the token it is this is a way

783
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,140
to drain all the token from a flash

784
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,140
clone smart contract

785
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,599
so you just have to follow this

786
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:45,000
um this workflow

787
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,160
withdraw that you can send the token

788
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,700
back to you and you have ordered okay

789
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,720
so I develop a smart contract to perform

790
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,040
the exploit I launch my exploit

791
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,240
and I got a surprise

792
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,640
I had some debug on my code because I

793
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,980
was learning so before launching my

794
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,680
exploits I was checking the balance of

795
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,619
my target I was checking my own balance

796
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,700
then I launch export and I check again

797
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,380
boss balance

798
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,280
so I can see that after my export the

799
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,320
smartphone right don't have any token

800
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,599
anymore so my export is working

801
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,359
so token are not here

802
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:33,480
the problem is my balance

803
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,079
didn't change at all so I stole the

804
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,040
token

805
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,880
but I have no idea where is the token

806
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,060
at this point I was just like why is the

807
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,980
token where's the money I mean my spot

808
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,619
did work because with the contract with

809
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,180
the vulnerable contract don't have any

810
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,420
token anymore that's

811
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,020
sorry

812
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,520
oh uh I'm going to tell you it was a lot

813
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,220
so unfortunately nobody got any any loss

814
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,760
so I double check my exports my smart

815
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,339
contracts once twice

816
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:18,060
and I didn't find the reason

817
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,820
it wasn't in my export at all

818
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,339
it was on my launcher

819
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:27,780
I was doing this testing since hours it

820
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,000
was the middle of the night I was tired

821
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,460
it was like the five-star challenge I

822
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,000
was doing and a lot of research even if

823
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,820
the export looks pretty simple it took

824
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,800
me some time to understand the the

825
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,200
process and perform the exploits

826
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,560
and on my um

827
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,839
on my launcher when I just called my

828
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:50,940
smart contract with the exploit

829
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,540
I just provide the wrong parameter

830
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,900
I just copy past information from other

831
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,000
experts I'm sure a lot of people are

832
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,940
doing pencils do the same when you are

833
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,220
doing expectations

834
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,040
a lot of time you copy some piece of

835
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,200
code from my previous point to use it

836
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,660
and at the end I just call my contract

837
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,680
to attack

838
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,980
and it's been it's instead of providing

839
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:22,020
my own wallet as a Target to resize the

840
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,200
token I just provide uh

841
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,619
token advice so this is a contract that

842
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:31,800
clears the token that's owned by no one

843
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,260
and controlled by no one so at this

844
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,180
point the token was just on a contract

845
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,619
owned by no one and just locked and lost

846
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:43,980
so if it was uh in production at this

847
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,740
kind of an ability open in production I

848
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,480
would not just

849
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,380
lost all the money because I was tired

850
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,940
so I

851
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,700
at this point I just understand oh it

852
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:02,339
can be easy to damage a project or you

853
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:06,720
can lost a bunch of token or money just

854
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,460
because of our very damp error

855
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,060
and

856
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,079
um

857
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,060
so

858
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,420
the moral of this story is you can't

859
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,020
perform a bug Bunty or testing the

860
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,380
magnet the same way as our as your

861
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,240
testing common web app

862
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,760
because if you are just

863
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,480
um

864
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,000
I know Terror launching tours starting

865
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,740
to bridgeforce address

866
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,940
etci

867
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,300
at a point you will make a mistake and

868
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,520
just block and destroy a complete

869
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,700
project

870
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,540
every time you are working on a bug

871
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,119
Bunty for smartphone Target blockchains

872
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,700
you need to remember that everything you

873
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,780
do you do is irreversible you can't undo

874
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,480
your action

875
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,599
so uh sometimes you don't have other

876
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:03,839
choice to test in magnet to test in

877
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,180
production mostly for bug Bounty most of

878
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,700
the bug Bunty program provides just

879
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,240
address of contract on the main net so

880
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,579
you are just with your own

881
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:15,900
responsibility

882
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,500
and sometimes it's a good idea to just

883
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,859
sleep a little bit take a break before

884
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,859
launching your export no when I'm not

885
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:28,740
sure of the result I'm just

886
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,380
going outside taking your work and

887
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,780
double checking my code

888
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,040
with a freshman because it can be very

889
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,820
scary to launch and exploit in a minute

890
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:46,160
what no you have all the information

891
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,040
to start working on the blockchain

892
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,220
security if you are more into algorithms

893
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,859
and Mathematics you can learn about the

894
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:58,500
consensus to try to correct a blockchain

895
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,560
in his own design

896
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,579
you can learn smart contract language to

897
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:09,119
try to do backbundies get rich by doing

898
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,180
the real stuff you can also focus on

899
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:18,260
this dirty web two plus one application

900
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,680
uh you have a lot of possibility

901
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:28,980
so before we I close this torch what is

902
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,140
coming next after this

903
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,660
there is a lot of thing

904
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,540
the bug Bounty programs we have an

905
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,480
overview and what you should do what you

906
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,020
shouldn't do to to get Bounty without

907
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,760
breaking anything

908
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,240
but there is other stupidity or the

909
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,200
differences with a common documentary as

910
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,300
I said before everything is public on a

911
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,660
blockchain so the other terms when they

912
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,780
are doing tests you can see every tracks

913
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,060
it's like doing a bug bounty on the

914
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,880
platform having access to all the logs

915
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,060
so I know the first Speaker talk about

916
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,060
collaboration and he's right but in

917
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,660
blackbox and blockchain back booty this

918
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,700
is more player versus player oriented

919
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,680
this is a

920
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,560
the first we got all the information and

921
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,260
we have a working expert that got all

922
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,579
the money

923
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:30,119
because you don't have

924
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:33,359
um pseudonym you don't have an email you

925
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,280
just add a Roundup address with exha

926
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,780
decimal characters

927
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:42,000
so you can do the laser tracks analyze

928
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,339
the action of announcers

929
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:46,980
who are going to find a bug and find the

930
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,880
bug before him

931
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,180
um

932
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,339
I have some other talk a focus on

933
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:55,560
consensus analysis but this is more

934
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,540
longer and more mathematic oriented

935
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,440
and the next level is what we call imev

936
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,460
or minab extractable value this is

937
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,580
um

938
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,240
[Music]

939
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,740
when you are working directly with a

940
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,940
node on your side you can detect a

941
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,780
transaction before it will accept its uh

942
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,180
it was accepted in the blockchain so

943
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,900
basically you can develop some tools to

944
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,640
detect an attack

945
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,319
and what we call that front frame so we

946
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,440
place the attack before the attacker so

947
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,240
basically this is a very interesting

948
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,880
because you can monitor a blockchain so

949
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,880
an attack coming replace the attack just

950
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,880
one block before the attacker and get

951
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,920
the money before the attacker to save

952
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,480
them on your cross

953
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,760
let's just see what Builders will bring

954
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,400
us because this is still an early stage

955
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,859
for blockchain as we saw with the web

956
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:00,260
two plus one

957
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,339
this is a lot of around version

958
00:46:04,339 --> 00:46:09,119
so let's see what uh what is coming and

959
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,040
what we are going to test in the

960
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,580
shutters

961
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,980
[Music]

962
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,200
uh so no since this is the last third

963
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,000
cup of the day if you have questions

964
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,240
feel free to ask if not we can just have

965
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,780
a beers and we can also discuss any

966
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,160
question with appears

967
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,220
thank you

968
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:33,960
[Applause]

969
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,099
any question comments remarks

970
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:41,420
what kind of beer do you like

971
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,160
oh it's again

972
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,680
thank you very much for your talk uh

973
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,560
actually I was really interested in like

974
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,119
the smart contracts because I think it's

975
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:57,240
a feel that auditing of smart contracts

976
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,400
I think it's a field a lot of people are

977
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,560
not paying attention but it's actually

978
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,380
like really interesting and it has some

979
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,960
vulnerabilities That You Don't See many

980
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,680
of them like the old C programs do you

981
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,319
have like any let's say suggested path

982
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:15,180
for people to actually start and get

983
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,099
into the smart contracts and auditing

984
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:21,960
smart contracts uh yes in fact uh smart

985
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,920
contract language are not that hard

986
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,339
um it's pretty similar to

987
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:30,060
thank you

988
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,760
to what you can see everywhere it's a

989
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,619
mix of JavaScript you have some language

990
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,339
more close to CEO of C plus plus so you

991
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:39,960
have Choice

992
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,920
um

993
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,280
you can this is not one language one

994
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,859
blockchain most of the blockchain the

995
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:51,619
buzz based on ethereum can use multiple

996
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:54,480
language so you can interact with a

997
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,220
contract with a language you you prefer

998
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,920
so just look around find projects where

999
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,040
you are interested in find the language

1000
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,339
you are more comfortable with and just

1001
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:09,380
do it

1002
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,660
and you have some pretty good Core Labs

1003
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,200
like the winner BFI to be honest I

1004
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,220
wasn't

1005
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,339
I was variable to build a smart contract

1006
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:24,300
before I try to hack them so I just

1007
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,700
learned a smartphone programming by

1008
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,260
attacking the

1009
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:31,140
not in prediction of course yeah thank

1010
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,560
you very much

1011
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,260
thank you Rio thank you Dylan any other

1012
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,619
question

1013
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,780
going once going twice okay now

1014
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,760
we're gonna start with a raffle let's go
