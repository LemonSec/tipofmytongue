1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,700
hello everyone

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,620
so uh welcome to this much needed

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,480
security conference which is building

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,580
and promoting the information security

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,219
community in the western Balkans region

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,920
this session is about privacy and

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,640
risk-based authentication and ironically

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,460
I will start by presenting some data

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,619
personal data with you

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,619
so as you heard my name is gracea and

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,300
I'm an experienced data protection

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,020
specialist at procredit bank Kosovo I

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,300
have a background in cyber security I'm

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,640
a graduate from a computer engineering

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,399
and currently I'm pursuing my Master's

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,260
studies in the International University

17
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,620
of applied sciences before this hands-on

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,260
experience on implementing gdpr in the

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,260
banking sector I used to work with some

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,899
of the most famous ISO standards in

21
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,600
information security cyber security and

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,399
risk management

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,160
one of the most frequent questions I get

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,760
asked is why data protection so that you

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,299
have a legal background to exercise that

26
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,100
and I assume many of you were thinking

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,640
the same well uh data security and data

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,460
privacy are the two basic elements of a

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,860
cyber security as nearly every

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,740
organization today that exists relies on

31
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,100
data the loss of data or misuse of one

32
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,159
can cause tremendous consequences for an

33
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,540
organization

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,900
however impairing security does not only

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,479
affect the organization itself because

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,780
it can cause impairable uh unimparable

37
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,900
damages to individuals to whom the data

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,960
belongs as well that is why a protection

39
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,600
of personal data in particular has

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,720
become more and more important we as

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,540
data protection Specialists cooperate

42
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,880
closely with software development teams

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,520
and information security teams

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,399
for two reasons to protect and secure

45
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,520
the data but also to comply with the

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,680
principles of privacy by Design and

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,560
privacy by default this principle

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,560
require every organization to consider

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,620
data protection and privacy at every

50
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,040
step and every project and activity that

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,379
processes personal data

52
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,220
nearly all key processes and activities

53
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,560
that we use in an organization today

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,520
process personal data and that is why

55
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,459
having an understanding of I.T security

56
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,300
I.T management and I.T configuration is

57
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,819
a basic skill to succeed in a data

58
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,440
protection role

59
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,940
uh

60
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,819
this session today comprises three main

61
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,700
pillars I will introduce the risk-based

62
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,160
authentication and how it works to

63
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,620
continue with the privacy and risk-based

64
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,260
authentication and to conclude with key

65
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,239
privacy threats and mitigations

66
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,940
create strong passwords this is a very

67
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,280
common advice for many security

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,780
specialists

69
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,440
even Microsoft itself states that uh one

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,659
of the most important ways to ensure

71
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,819
that your online accounts are safe and

72
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,300
secure is to protect your passwords but

73
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,659
is it because a study shows that on

74
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,739
average a user has 16 online identities

75
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,800
what this means is that we as users tend

76
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,080
to choose simple and easy to guess

77
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,620
passwords but also tend to reuse the

78
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,319
same passwords across services that is

79
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,840
why in practice passwords have many

80
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,120
security flaws

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,239
one of them is that users are prone to

82
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,940
disclosing passwords to attacks such as

83
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,000
phishing but we also reuse the same

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,700
passwords across Services what this

85
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,640
means is that a compromise of accounts

86
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,700
on one service leads to a compromise of

87
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,879
accounts on many other services and last

88
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,760
but not least today modern password

89
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,519
cracking tools exist and the latest

90
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,659
studies studies show that um a password

91
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:20,160
tracking tool can find up to 2.7 billion

92
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,820
passwords

93
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,160
according to a research released by

94
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,880
skycloud researchers discovered that 700

95
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,759
million so we are talking about 700

96
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,300
million exposed credentials only in the

97
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,440
last year and to make the matters worse

98
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,160
72 percent of users guess what still use

99
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,759
the same passwords so no surprise that

100
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,820
major online services are doing

101
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,440
something on this

102
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,340
one of the most proposed measures is a

103
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,040
two-factor authentication in a

104
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,440
two-factor authentication a user

105
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,360
confirms possession of another

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,720
credential linked to the account

107
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,580
typically by a hardware token an

108
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,580
authentication app a mobile phone or or

109
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,199
an email address

110
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,199
however as two-factor authentication is

111
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,500
an opt-in process so it requires user

112
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,740
intervention the user acceptance is very

113
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,740
low for instance Google Google has

114
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,840
offered two-factor authentication since

115
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,639
2011.

116
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,600
however only 10 percent of users so 10

117
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,240
percent of users were actively using it

118
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,300
in 2018.

119
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,000
uh what can be done to protect against

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,340
two-factor authentication to make it

121
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,520
more usable implicit authentication is

122
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,139
one of the answers

123
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,100
so if we classify the logging data as

124
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,580
suspicious or normal attempts then we

125
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,000
can differentiate these attempts by

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,580
other parameters and define whether it

127
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,180
is suspicious implicit authentication is

128
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,699
practical because it is employed in the

129
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,060
background without user intervention and

130
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,340
it is secure as it is a continuous

131
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,720
process

132
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,840
a risk-based authentication that I will

133
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,560
elaborate more during the day is a

134
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,500
two-factor is an implicit authentication

135
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,080
form

136
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,479
RBA or risk-based authentication is

137
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,940
recommended by the National Institute of

138
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,919
Standards and technology and the

139
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,620
national cyber security Center of United

140
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,500
States to protect users against password

141
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,240
spraying and credential scripting

142
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,800
RBA has an increased password

143
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,880
authentication security because uh it

144
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,880
leaves the usability in act commercial

145
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,759
sales of RBA Solutions are currently

146
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,660
increasing and expect to do so

147
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,800
supporting the demand of strong

148
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,460
authentication methods however currently

149
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,419
the use of RBA is limited to a number of

150
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,419
major service providers like Amazon

151
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,520
Facebook Google and Linkedin

152
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,880
but how does RBA work RPA monitors

153
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,720
contextual features that can range from

154
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,419
a network features such as an IP address

155
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,960
to client behavioral information such as

156
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,060
logging time

157
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,280
and based on these parameters it

158
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,740
calculates a risk score so when we as

159
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,280
users submit our logging form the risk

160
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,900
based on uh the risk-based

161
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,940
authentication calculates the risk score

162
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,699
which is typically classified into three

163
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,660
main categories low medium and high

164
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,020
if the user behavior is as always then

165
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,360
the access is granted and the user is

166
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,580
not bothered by another form of

167
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,819
authentication whereas if the risk score

168
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,979
is medium or high

169
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,940
then depending on the RBA implementation

170
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,280
the system requires more information as

171
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,280
a proof If no proof is given then access

172
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,239
is denied

173
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,240
so far so good RBA is offering high

174
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,500
security

175
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,400
is leaving the user ability inept so why

176
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,400
we should consider privacy well don't

177
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,779
forget that RBA offers security and

178
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,880
usability but all at the cost of

179
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,940
processing our data a data that may have

180
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,099
a potential reference to our personal

181
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,600
data and in case an RBA database is

182
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,540
forwarded or breached then we are at a

183
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,839
higher risk than usual because not only

184
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,660
the traditional username is explo is

185
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,339
exploited

186
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,519
in addition security is not enough to

187
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,779
meet privacy regulations and uh we all

188
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,120
agree that security and privacy have in

189
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,700
common and focus on protection of data

190
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,640
however there is a difference

191
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,459
security protects confidentiality

192
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,740
integrity and availability of

193
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,440
information and privacy on the other

194
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,740
hand is more granular on privacy rights

195
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,980
with respect to personal data and

196
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,380
privacy will always Prevail when there

197
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,920
is personal data processing

198
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,140
whereas Security will continue to focus

199
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,779
on the information protection of

200
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,660
information assets

201
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,420
considering this I will elaborate why

202
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,360
the integration of RBA systems should

203
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,180
consider data protection laws and

204
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,180
regulations

205
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,839
but what is personal data personal data

206
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,779
is a term used in gdpr the famous

207
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,019
General data protection regulation

208
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,959
as other terms used instead of personal

209
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,899
data are personal information and pii

210
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,360
the personally identifiable information

211
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,140
as used in ISO standards the definitions

212
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,600
however are very similar

213
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,920
so personal data is any information

214
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,720
relating to an identifiable natural

215
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,600
person which can be directly or

216
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,779
indirectly identified I know very

217
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,140
theoretical so let's focus on the key

218
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,779
information and map them to the RBA

219
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,459
context

220
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,580
data used by RBA certainly Falls within

221
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,339
the personal data definition two main

222
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,420
reasons the RBA works by implement the

223
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,540
implementation of RBA Works relying on

224
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,120
feature values these feature values are

225
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,060
unique identifiers by themselves for

226
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,880
instance IP address on the other hand

227
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,620
the risk score

228
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,200
the risk score is classified as a unique

229
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,500
identifier itself because indirectly

230
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,220
identifies us and our

231
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,140
interaction with the system

232
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,959
introduction of data privacy regulations

233
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,720
and laws has dramatically changed the

234
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,300
way the online services are processing

235
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,820
and collecting our personal data for

236
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,040
instance the gdpr and the Californian

237
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,060
consumer Privacy Act from firmly losing

238
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,940
recommendations on how to handle data we

239
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,160
now have clear and binding data

240
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,140
protection principles

241
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,779
these principles of processing personal

242
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,140
data are namely the lawfulness fairness

243
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,940
and transparency

244
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,260
the purpose limitation data minimization

245
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,480
accuracy storage limitation integrity

246
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,240
and confidentiality in the following

247
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,700
slides I will outline the requirements

248
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,360
of each principle and how the RBA system

249
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,620
should Implement them

250
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,220
to process personal data we must have a

251
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,980
lawful basis for processing but we also

252
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,079
should be fair and transparent with the

253
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,140
user what this means in the RBA context

254
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,140
is that the design of RBA should be with

255
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,700
consent in mind

256
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,420
why to provide users with clear and easy

257
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,920
to use easy to understand explanations

258
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,079
the second principle is purpose

259
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,839
limitation personal data should be

260
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,779
collected for specific explicit and

261
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,420
legitimate purposes and no further

262
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,120
processing is incompatible with the

263
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
first purpose is allowed what this means

264
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,579
in the RBA context is that the future

265
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:48,000
values can only be used to calculate the

266
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,279
risk score itself

267
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,620
so the next principle is data

268
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,000
minimization

269
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,160
what this principle states is that

270
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,339
personal data shall be adequate relevant

271
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,760
and limited to what is necessary in the

272
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,339
relation to the purposes of processing

273
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,959
personal data

274
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,540
in the RBA context this means that

275
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,820
feature values should be reviewed for

276
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,200
suitability

277
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,579
and redundant data should be deleted

278
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,700
however in practice it's not this simple

279
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,720
because providers of RBA systems should

280
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,500
consider that data minimization can

281
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,720
impact the risk or reliability

282
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,959
another principle which is

283
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,380
straightforward is accuracy accuracy

284
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,300
means that personal data should be

285
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,540
accurate and up to date however in the

286
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,019
RBA context this is crucial why if we

287
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:53,339
have an incorrect feature value then the

288
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,000
risk score is or medium or high what

289
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,160
this means is that the user is prompt

290
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,519
with another factor to be authenticated

291
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,920
and what we are doing we are converting

292
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,079
the RBA to a second Factor

293
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,779
authentication if you remember from the

294
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,420
slides before I stated that second

295
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,480
Factor authentication has a very low

296
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,320
acceptance user acceptance so we do not

297
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,720
want to end there

298
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,720
oh

299
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,800
okay

300
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,820
storage limitation

301
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,019
storage limitation this means to follow

302
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,380
is it good

303
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,899
stories limitation this principle states

304
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,480
that personal data shall be kept in a

305
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,699
form which permits identification of

306
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:51,300
data subjects only for what is necessary

307
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,519
and how long is necessary for the

308
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,519
purpose of processing what this means in

309
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,360
the RBA context is that if data or no

310
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,019
user used or no longer used then they

311
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,000
should be securely destroyed or

312
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,760
anonymized for the time being it's

313
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,000
important to know that anonymized data

314
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,899
is no personal data because I will cover

315
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:17,940
anonymization in the following slides

316
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,480
that is why as a provider of RBA if we

317
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,300
anonymize data we can continue to use

318
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,560
this data for testing purposes

319
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,720
the last principle is integrity and

320
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,480
confidentiality personal data should be

321
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,060
processed in a manner that ensures

322
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,760
appropriate security and protects

323
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,579
against unauthorized access damage or

324
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:44,040
destruction some of the proposed

325
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,100
measures are pseudonymization masking

326
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,860
and encryption

327
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,399
foreign

328
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,760
I talked about two terms maybe it's the

329
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,040
first time that you heard maybe you use

330
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,519
them in your everyday life at work

331
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:01,380
pseudonymization and anonymization reach

332
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,820
their Fame when gdpr was introduced

333
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,579
not knowing security and data protection

334
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,459
tend to use them interchangeably please

335
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,779
don't do that there is a big difference

336
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,160
pseudonymization is the process of

337
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,639
replacing personal identifiers with a

338
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,860
pseudonym if you can see from the

339
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,639
picture we are replacing the name with a

340
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,139
bunch of numbers

341
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,579
but for the time being we cannot

342
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:35,220
re-identify in the individuals if we

343
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,220
don't have the key that is why

344
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,600
pseudonymized data Falls within the

345
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,899
scope of personal data however fewer

346
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,620
processing restrictions apply

347
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,600
anonymization on the other hand is the

348
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,759
process of removing elements from

349
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,779
personal data so the process is

350
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,440
irreversibly this does not uh as such

351
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,199
Anonymous data is excluded from the

352
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,779
scope of personal data and is not

353
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:07,740
subject to privacy and gdpr laws

354
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,500
foreign

355
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,559
coming to the last part I will present

356
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,599
the Privacy threats and mitigations

357
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,540
two common threads that we see related

358
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,780
to the RBA context are data misuse and

359
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,040
data breach

360
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,340
a misuse of RBA feature values

361
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,220
is that is when we use the feature

362
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,620
values for other purposes rather than

363
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,740
calculating the risk score typically for

364
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,919
user tracking profiling or advertising

365
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,860
no wonder it is a threat because we have

366
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,980
seen happen before where a phone number

367
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,500
stored for second Factor authentication

368
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,260
were used for tracking and advertising

369
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,980
to users we as users should trust our

370
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,380
online service providers to not misuse

371
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,679
our data however a responsible service

372
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,740
provider should take precautions to

373
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,020
minimize the misuse of scenarios or

374
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,299
unintended processing

375
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,120
data bridge on the other hand

376
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,179
is when an unauthorized person processes

377
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,000
personal data or has access to this data

378
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,580
a data breach is an attack on

379
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,580
confidentiality as such it allows

380
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,520
attackers to use the feature values

381
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,799
to link profiles at different online

382
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,320
services even if we use other

383
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,500
credentials they can find Who We Are

384
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,780
depending on the service this could

385
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,059
result in negative social or legal

386
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,820
consequences for the individuals and

387
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,520
enable account takeover attack on a

388
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,240
larger scale

389
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,740
but how can we mitigate them two methods

390
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,940
aggregation and logging history

391
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,179
minimization we can aggregate the

392
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,299
feature values in the logging history so

393
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:03,120
we can only reveal how often a feature

394
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,460
value occurs instead of its

395
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,820
chronological order by aggregation we

396
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,100
mitigate the re-identification in

397
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,780
logging sequences

398
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,660
on the other hand by limiting the

399
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,900
logging history in terms of the number

400
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,480
of features and entries we mitigate

401
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,179
tracking users for an extended period of

402
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,760
time this has already been proved

403
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,220
because the study shows that

404
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,340
few entries are sufficient to achieve a

405
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,720
high RBA protection

406
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,600
this was privacy and risk-based

407
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,480
authentication what I talked about was

408
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,000
that risk-based authentication is an

409
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,640
implicit authentication form

410
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,660
which offers high security and usability

411
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,940
but please don't forget at the cost of

412
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,179
processing our personal data that is why

413
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,360
design of RBA systems must balance

414
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,940
security and privacy

415
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,620
I want to conclude by quoting Steve Jobs

416
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,440
he once stated that privacy means people

417
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,380
know what they're signing up for so

418
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,520
fairness

419
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,539
in plain language and repeatedly we

420
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:22,200
should provide update the Privacy notice

421
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,620
I believe people are smart but some

422
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,480
people want to share more than other

423
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,660
people do we just have to ask them so

424
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,059
obtain their consent

425
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,679
however

426
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,500
I encourage you to think whether this

427
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,780
quote really stands or not

428
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,450
thank you

429
