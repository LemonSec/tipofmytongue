1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,540
hello everyone welcome and thank you so

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,940
much for joining us today on our talk as

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,920
we dive into the dark side of wireless

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,960
networks and introduction to wi-fi

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,179
hacking my name is Maggie and this is

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,680
Ryan and we're very happy to be here

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,940
today

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,740
all right so a quick disclaimer before

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,660
we get started we do want to say that

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,199
any attempt at hacking or manipulating a

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,880
device or network that you do not have

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,039
permission to or you do not own is

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,859
illegal so please if you choose to do

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:32,820
anything that we're going to be showing

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,980
you in this in this uh slide deck it is

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,719
for educational purposes and please make

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,280
sure that if you try to replicate any of

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,780
it it is done in a controlled

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,399
environment that you have permission to

20
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,940
be working on such as a home lab

21
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,739
now many people

22
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,600
um I'm sure I'm assuming because this is

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,039
a security conference you are all

24
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,899
familiar with how Wi-Fi works and what

25
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,600
it is however for the general public it

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,820
is oftentimes not quite understood just

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,739
how important wireless networks are

28
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,780
outside of just that they can connect to

29
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,520
the internet not only are they being

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,500
used to ensure that everything in our

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,600
world is operational but when

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,520
misconfigured they can be used as attack

33
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,280
surfaces for larger more complex and

34
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,380
sophisticated attacks to go after both

35
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,780
individuals and companies as a whole so

36
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,280
what we want to be doing in this

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,900
presentation is covering some of those

38
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,939
instances breaking down these events

39
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,100
when a Wi-Fi networks have been hacked

40
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,140
explaining what happened why it happened

41
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,400
and then going through and actually

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,200
showing how these attacks can be

43
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,180
replicated

44
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,040
all right so the first story that we're

45
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,900
going to start with is the vengeful uh

46
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,960
neighbor so uh back in 2008

47
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,840
um a new couple recently removed uh

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,040
moved into a new neighborhood in

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,740
Minnesota it was they had they were well

50
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,020
educated individuals one the husband was

51
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,520
a lawyer and then

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,020
all of a sudden they started getting

53
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,000
complaints from their co-workers as well

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,799
as their boss saying that hey we're

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,540
getting some inappropriate work emails

56
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,299
from you guys and they were not the

57
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,920
couple was not admitting was not sure

58
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,659
what was going on and were very

59
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,159
concerned as you see on the screenshots

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,600
here

61
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
as the investigation started from the

62
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,060
company

63
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,899
the couple didn't think much of it until

64
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,580
some a more serious com

65
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,099
um investigation started from the Secret

66
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,640
Service an email was sent to then Vice

67
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,980
President Joe Biden with a death threat

68
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,959
Secret Service knocked the door of the

69
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,000
couple and they started saying that you

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,220
uh this email was originated by your IP

71
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,680
address they started looking into all

72
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,379
the network traffic and they actually

73
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,300
verified that indeed it was sent it was

74
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,040
originated by the home network of the

75
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,800
couple the IP address matched uh the

76
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,420
couple kept denying it and wasn't sure

77
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,580
what was going on and upon

78
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,040
um the the law firm that the couple

79
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,280
worked at they started doing a digital

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,340
forensic investigation and upon seeing

81
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,920
the logs of the emails they were they

82
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,019
saw that there was another the IP

83
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,819
address was still their home address uh

84
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,580
home uh Network address however there

85
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,260
was a new device that was unauthorized

86
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,000
that was never used before that was

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,780
logged in and authenticated then

88
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,760
um with more research that they more

89
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,260
digging in they were able to find out

90
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,420
that that device belonged to a Neighbor

91
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,620
Next Door

92
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,140
so then um they found out that the

93
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,180
Neighbor Next Door was a cyber criminal

94
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,280
that targeted the couple he was mad at

95
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,140
them and wanted to Revenge by hacking

96
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,180
into their Wi-Fi he spent about three

97
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,819
weeks looking at the different types of

98
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,040
um wi-fi hacking techniques and tools

99
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,920
and found out that their router was

100
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,920
using WEP encryption and found some ways

101
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,760
to

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,159
um crack it so after like about two or

103
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,019
three weeks he was able to get in he

104
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,879
cracked his password or their password

105
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,459
and then started sending creating fake

106
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,620
email accounts and social media accounts

107
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,540
like Myspace and started sending emails

108
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,760
to their work to their work co-workers

109
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,760
and bosses and being

110
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,620
um doing real damage to their careers

111
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,840
and their lives with the investigation

112
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,420
from Secret Services once they showed up

113
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,560
um they were really concerned about the

114
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,379
Yahoo email death threat to Joe Biden so

115
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,000
that kind of sparked a big investigation

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,519
to go in and that way they went and

117
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,620
searched the neighbor's house where they

118
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,360
found a lot of evidence that every

119
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,099
single attack or every single email that

120
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,019
was sent was from that device and from

121
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,100
the um from the neighbors computer the

122
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,280
hacker downloaded Wi-Fi software and um

123
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,380
because of the week encryption as well

124
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,759
as the weak password he was able to

125
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,380
break in

126
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,400
um

127
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,199
now let's talk about some terminology

128
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,780
that we'll be using later on too yes so

129
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,580
to fully understand how this hacker was

130
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,199
able to gain access to the wireless

131
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,300
network we need to do a little history

132
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,139
lesson on wireless encryption so Wi-Fi

133
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,419
began had its first standardized

134
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,759
encryption method back in 1997 which was

135
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,979
called WEP and since then there's been

136
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,620
three major uh version updates all the

137
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,660
way up to what we currently use the wpa3

138
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,759
now the main improvements for each of

139
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,139
these versions was to address previous

140
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,300
security concerns identified in the

141
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,340
other versions as well as keeping up to

142
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,180
date with new and emerging Technologies

143
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,600
the big issue with these different

144
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,979
encryption is not necessarily that they

145
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,479
are that they have known vulnerabilities

146
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,759
it's that they're not all kept up to

147
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,340
date current routers uh that exist out

148
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,280
in the real world are not up to date to

149
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,020
the most recent ones which means that

150
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,580
these vulnerabilities that have existed

151
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,479
on these older uh systems are known and

152
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,220
can be actively exploited and that's

153
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,720
where the biggest threat lies is that

154
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,060
they're not keeping up to date and some

155
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,800
cases this is intentional to save time

156
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,720
and money in many other cases it's just

157
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,100
the fact that people are not aware that

158
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,600
it needs to be updated and no one is

159
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,160
telling them they need to

160
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,720
um and real quick some other terms that

161
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,419
we are going to be using is WPS this is

162
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,820
a protocol in wireless networks you may

163
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,320
be familiar with as a little button that

164
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,660
you can push on a router to connect a

165
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,979
device without having to enter the

166
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,139
password this is a known insecure

167
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,780
protocol however it is still very widely

168
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,900
used throughout the entire world and is

169
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,400
often misconfigured when used

170
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,080
additionally we also want you to be

171
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,660
familiar with the term essid this is

172
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,580
just the name of the network so when you

173
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,199
join a wireless network whatever it says

174
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,160
that you're connected to on your phone

175
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,919
or computer that is the ESS ID it is to

176
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,120
be known that is different from the

177
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,180
bssid which is the hexadecimal value

178
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,460
associated with an access points such as

179
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,740
a router that connects you to an actual

180
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,380
wireless network

181
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,300
so as we mentioned in this specific

182
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,220
instance the hacker was breaking into

183
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,380
the web encryption standard of the

184
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,180
neighbor's Wi-Fi at the time of this

185
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,520
attack it was 2009 so meaning that the

186
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,160
web encryption standard uh had been used

187
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,080
for about 10 years but was outdated by

188
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,240
two different versions so it should not

189
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,280
have been being used but it was but

190
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,900
let's take a look at exactly how this

191
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,819
web encryption standard works and why

192
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,259
the hacker was able to take advantage of

193
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,380
it so there's two main aspects going on

194
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,000
here we have the top portion and the

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,919
bottom portion that top portion we can

196
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,539
see there's the plain text which is just

197
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:58,979
the general information that's being

198
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,380
sent from a computer to whatever Network

199
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,940
you're trying to send it to so if you're

200
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,319
communicating with a website the

201
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,460
information that you're sending to a

202
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,139
website will be stored there and then

203
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,600
will be sent over this plain text is

204
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,979
then put through a mathematical

205
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,620
algorithm to get that icv value all this

206
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,319
does is it allows a endpoint such as the

207
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,819
website to verify that the information

208
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,340
is being sent is legitimate and has not

209
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,319
been changed this is very helpful

210
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,080
however if this message is just as is

211
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,060
people will still be able to read the

212
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,580
actual contents of the message and as

213
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,740
technology has evolved since 1997 there

214
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,479
are current attacks that can be done to

215
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,000
then still change the message and change

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,280
that end value so even if it comes out

217
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,199
with that value it's not it's not

218
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,060
necessarily that it hasn't been changed

219
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,220
so that's why we need to added the

220
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,539
second part the lower portion the

221
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,520
encryption standard so what's going on

222
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,500
is we have two different values that IV

223
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,960
and that shared key these combined are

224
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,880
supposed to have been a very long number

225
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,620
that would be hard to guess that is

226
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,660
constantly changing so that every time

227
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,160
that is used it can then be put through

228
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,560
an algorithm that combines scrambles up

229
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,300
the message so that only the end

230
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,000
receiver in this case a website could be

231
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,039
able to decrypt it and understand what

232
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,860
the message is being said but since this

233
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,500
is made back in 1997 What was considered

234
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,440
to be a long enough number back then is

235
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,120
no longer the case with emerging

236
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,319
Technologies we can do what are called

237
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,539
Brute Force attacks to guess all of the

238
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,819
possible potential numbers in order to

239
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,860
guess in order to identify what is the

240
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,780
real number and able to decrypt the

241
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,780
actual message but in some instances if

242
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,700
you just make the number longer it still

243
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,458
becomes uh encrypted and it becomes very

244
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,958
hard to break unless you have very

245
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,380
expensive Hardware so the other big

246
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,440
issue is that IV value it is supposed to

247
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,300
be constantly changed every single

248
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,580
instance of communication the problem is

249
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,620
there is no way for the actual standard

250
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,600
to enforce this meaning that most people

251
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,820
don't change that number every time and

252
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,380
since really all that's going on is

253
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,760
there's just a mathematical algorithm

254
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,100
that's using here that's being used to

255
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,800
encrypt the individual message patterns

256
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,540
can emerge if the same numbers are being

257
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,880
used so with a large enough sample size

258
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,220
of different packets then you can begin

259
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,620
to limit the amount of numbers that you

260
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,779
need to check before identifying the

261
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,060
specific number as a result then you

262
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,560
don't have to guess every single number

263
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,540
you only just have to guess a limited

264
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,860
amount and this is exactly what the

265
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,779
hacker was targeting over a week or so

266
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,339
period the hacker was able to gain a

267
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,959
large enough sample size size with this

268
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,700
number not being changed so that it

269
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,860
limited how many tests he had to perform

270
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,899
and eventually was able to guess the

271
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,000
correct numbers reversing this entire

272
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,860
process identifying what the messages

273
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,959
were and eventually gaining the password

274
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,580
from that that was stored in that

275
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,860
initial plain text message from there he

276
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,660
can then join the network and do all the

277
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,440
attacks that was that we've discussed

278
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,420
all right so we started talking about uh

279
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,940
WEP which was a little outdated and has

280
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,740
been cracked a long time ago now let's

281
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,000
start talking about something that is

282
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,279
more relevant or more recent

283
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,000
um this is about WAP attacks that uh WPA

284
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,220
attacks that uh this actually was not

285
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,019
done by a malicious actor it was a

286
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,760
research conducted in uh Tel Aviv

287
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,220
however it proves a very good point of

288
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,940
how unsecure some routers can be uh Expo

289
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,060
city is a research project that took

290
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,540
place in Tel Aviv in 2018 and was

291
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,459
conducted only with 50 worth of

292
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,740
equipment well a laptop some free Cali

293
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,580
tools as well as a signal booster or

294
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,640
adapter that was used to boost the

295
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,620
signal signal so that the whole city can

296
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,740
potentially connect to that um the get

297
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,240
so that he can get the single for the

298
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,980
whole city he walked around with this

299
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,480
adapter and gathered as much information

300
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,080
as he could and then use that booster to

301
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,760
run scripts to exploit previously known

302
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,279
vulnerabilities such as pmkid which

303
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,140
basically allows you to collect to

304
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,940
collect hashed passwords and um

305
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,140
decompile or be able to crack them

306
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,959
without needing to look at any traffic

307
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,899
at all uh any network traffic so with

308
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,160
that said he walked around the city

309
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,260
collected 5000 hash passwords and

310
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,959
started uh cracking them he was not

311
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,339
successful with all of them however he

312
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,620
was successful with with over 3 500

313
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,720
passwords which is a large amount and

314
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,420
there was no limitation he just chose to

315
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,579
collect 5000 but he this could have had

316
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,779
much more

317
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,220
um this could have been much more

318
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,980
impactful uh this was very easy for him

319
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,260
because most people were using the full

320
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,019
phone number as their passwords uh so

321
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,120
that made it easy for him to guess and

322
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,860
brute force that way

323
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,420
um one of the main vulnerabilities for

324
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,600
pmkid attacks is the Wi-Fi roaming which

325
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,300
must be enabled and not a lot of not all

326
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,120
the routers have this feature however

327
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,260
the ones that they do they are

328
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,839
vulnerable to pmkid attacks

329
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,459
um although this took place in a

330
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,860
specific place like Tel Aviv the routers

331
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,720
the vendors of these routers that were

332
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,360
vulnerable to this type of attack are

333
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,300
known worldwide and this could be done

334
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,220
in any other country

335
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,320
now there are different types of wi-fi

336
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,120
hacking tools they can be used of course

337
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,260
they specialize in different things

338
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,600
depending on the scope and the target

339
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,160
however today we're going to talk about

340
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,260
two of them which are our favorites the

341
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,300
first one is air Suite tools which is a

342
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,100
Kali Linux

343
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,860
um a wi-fi hacking pen testing tool

344
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,240
Suite that has a lot of different

345
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,579
features from monitoring attacking

346
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,079
testing

347
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,480
um some of them are air mon or aircrack

348
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,860
and they can be used for uh enabling or

349
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,839
disabling the monitor mode which is the

350
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,160
first thing that we do for any type of

351
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,060
Wireless attacks in addition

352
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,339
uh that we have Wi-Fi which is a very

353
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,320
powerful automated Wi-Fi tool which

354
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,760
takes some of the tools from the air

355
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,220
Suite tools that takes those scripts and

356
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,019
automatically runs it so it does any

357
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,480
everything from finding those uh access

358
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,579
points that are available and up and

359
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,720
running uh from cracking the passwords

360
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,160
de-authenticating them and connecting

361
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,779
them to like a rogue access point or any

362
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,060
other attacks that they want to do such

363
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,480
as pmkid that we mentioned as well

364
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,880
now we could do an entire presentation

365
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,800
just on Wi-Fi encryption if we wanted to

366
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,180
and the different ways that we could try

367
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,300
to crack it but in lieu of that we are

368
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,800
going to kind of show you just the

369
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,660
overall General process for trying to

370
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,639
break wireless encryption

371
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,860
now the very first step is just to

372
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,019
identify which wireless networks you

373
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,300
want to be attacking if you're going to

374
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,800
follow a similar case to our first story

375
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,120
where you're targeting an individual

376
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,680
Network or if you're going to do

377
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,300
something along the second lines where

378
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,560
you're targeting a wide range of

379
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,480
networks either way you want to identify

380
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,519
which ones you want to Target and then

381
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,079
attempt to

382
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,500
access them without any hacking if you

383
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,899
can bypass this entire process just by

384
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,300
gaining access to an open network or by

385
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,220
asking someone for the password and it

386
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,600
saves a lot of time and you'd be

387
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,360
surprised at how easy this can be such

388
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,980
as going to a restaurant and instead of

389
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,480
trying to break it just asking for the

390
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,639
Wi-Fi if people aren't familiar with why

391
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,160
it's important not to share it but

392
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,139
assuming that's not the case then the

393
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,100
next step is you're going to want to get

394
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,160
that ESS ID the network names that's the

395
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,660
way we can Target something when we're

396
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,339
actually attempting to attack it there

397
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,860
are instances where the ESS ID is hidden

398
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,320
and it won't be visible at all or have a

399
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,420
name at all in which case you can run

400
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,399
these simple commands to identify the

401
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,639
BSS ID which will be used to then in the

402
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,440
same way show which specific Network we

403
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,260
want to Target to unleash our tools onto

404
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,019
so after this you'll have a Target and

405
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,220
you know what it's called and how to use

406
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,320
the tools against it so you're going to

407
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,740
ideally try an overall tool that's going

408
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,720
to address and identify different

409
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,399
information about the router and attempt

410
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,260
some of the most basic attacks in this

411
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,880
case as we mentioned we prefer Wi-Fi

412
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,860
it's very easy to use so we're going to

413
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,120
show you a quick demo of what that looks

414
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,220
like once we run Wi-Fi it's going to

415
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,540
start up it's going to go into monitor

416
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,620
mode and it's going to search for all

417
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,420
networks in that area in this case we're

418
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,100
targeting that second Network Netgear

419
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,380
80. and immediately once we select it

420
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,440
it's going to start doing those initial

421
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,600
vulnerability checks based on what

422
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,980
information it's able to gather in this

423
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,899
case we see that the WPS standard is

424
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,339
running so it's going to try to break

425
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,720
those we've configured it so that it

426
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,579
won't be the case so instead it's going

427
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,019
to go through and try some other methods

428
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,000
against the larger encryption standard

429
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,279
WPA in this case what we're able to find

430
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,440
is that with a client connected someone

431
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,300
was actively trying to join the network

432
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,579
we're able to steal that packet and

433
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,079
while it's encrypted we're able to find

434
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,420
a hashed value of the actual password

435
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,720
for or the wireless network as a result

436
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,699
of that we can then run a Brute Force

437
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,800
attack to try to break that hash and in

438
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,860
this case since we were using a the base

439
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,899
the default password it was able to be

440
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,699
found and identified this isn't always

441
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,199
going to be the case especially since

442
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,480
Wi-Fi itself is not specifically a hash

443
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,459
cracking tool but with this information

444
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,180
you can then pivot to more diff or more

445
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,339
specific tools such as something like

446
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,320
hashcat or John the Ripper that you can

447
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,720
then use to break more of these hashes

448
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,899
but even if it's not able to break it or

449
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,579
identify an immediate vulnerability that

450
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,620
you can exploit this information gained

451
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,360
by Wi-Fi will give you information about

452
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,980
the wireless network such as what

453
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,240
encryption it's using and any other

454
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,339
information that you can use and then

455
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,079
from there you can pivot to more

456
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,300
detailed tools that are specific again

457
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,699
these wireless networks the older

458
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,040
versions have been out for decades so

459
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,440
there are a whole lot of people who are

460
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,300
very intricately familiar with these

461
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,920
vulnerabilities how they work and have

462
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,779
created very specific tools to targeting

463
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,639
those abilities so out there you're

464
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,139
going to be able to find something or a

465
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:29,399
tool that you can pivot to to Target

466
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,459
that specifically so pivoting to those

467
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,260
and with enough time and dedication

468
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,839
you'll be able to break these older

469
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,639
encryption standards and find the

470
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,600
information that you're trying to gain

471
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,060
access to and then with that you'll be

472
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,100
able to gain access to the wireless

473
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,220
network

474
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,500
so moving on from encryption we're going

475
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,240
to tell a different story targeting a

476
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,279
different way that wireless networks can

477
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,040
be attacked so in this case we have a

478
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,620
traveler who is at an airport now they

479
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,380
wanted to access their internet do some

480
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,300
work while they're on their layover and

481
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,619
so while they were there they open up

482
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,119
their computer try to join the airport

483
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,919
Wi-Fi if you've ever been to an airport

484
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,419
I'm sure you've seen that there's a lot

485
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:10,619
of different networks that are available

486
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,780
and oftentimes what people will do is

487
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,400
just join the first one that seems to be

488
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,380
legitimate in this case it was named

489
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,380
Sydney free airport Wi-Fi joined it you

490
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,119
get the little pop-up it's asking her to

491
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,799
verify that hey you are a legitimate

492
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,540
traveler asking her where she's going

493
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,640
her plane ticket and then after entering

494
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,780
that information

495
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,580
she's able to gain access to the network

496
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,620
do the work that she was trying to do

497
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,900
and while she was there access her bank

498
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,480
records to check to see what uh just

499
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,580
check checking her bank account

500
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,380
a week later she goes back and checks

501
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,480
her bank account and identifies that a

502
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,460
purchase was made while she was on the

503
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,620
plane for a restaurant in Germany

504
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,419
obviously this wasn't her being that she

505
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,640
was actively flying so she does a little

506
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,780
bit of research and she's able to

507
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,520
identify that something called a rogue

508
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,340
access point was active in the airport

509
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,559
terminal while she was logged in and

510
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,880
that she had signed into the wrong

511
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,460
Network and as a result by checking her

512
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,860
bank password while or by checking her

513
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,500
bank account that fake Wi-Fi was able to

514
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,780
steal her information her username and

515
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,820
password and then log in and mess with

516
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,539
her bank account while she was away

517
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:17,160
now let's go ahead and go through the

518
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,900
breakdown of a rogue access point how

519
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,460
that is and what that is and how that

520
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,919
works so we said we mentioned on the

521
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,440
story that the user was logging into the

522
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
free Sydney Wi-Fi which is completely

523
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,299
enormous little legitimate access point

524
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:32,460
however there is unfortunately no way to

525
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,120
open the uh available networks and see

526
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,220
which one is the legitimate one and

527
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,260
which one is the Rogue access point so

528
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,179
there are a few other ones that are

529
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,280
available that have similar names and

530
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,220
this is done in um this is not this is

531
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,600
done so that people are confused and

532
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,679
they don't know which one to connect to

533
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,860
so an access point firstly is just any

534
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,600
entry point that connects you to the

535
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,580
internet it can be a wireless or an

536
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,039
Ethernet access point and then a rogue

537
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,799
access point is a uh when an attacker

538
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,520
sets up a an access point to monitor

539
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,500
your traffic but it's very similar it's

540
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,539
mimicking a legitimate one

541
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,100
um with the intention to steal your

542
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,960
personal information or interact with it

543
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,059
in different ways so when you users

544
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,620
connect to this we're able to get any

545
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,360
sensitive information there is two types

546
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,520
of perceptions there is passive and

547
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,160
active in passive perception we're able

548
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,380
to just see their traffic packets we're

549
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,640
able to see if they're logging into

550
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,200
their bank account for example and maybe

551
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,240
their passwords as well and um plain

552
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,919
text however we're not interacting at

553
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,980
all however in active perception we are

554
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,240
able to intercept and um do things with

555
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,160
what we're seeing on the on those

556
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,780
packets for example if they're doing a

557
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,179
bank transfer we can kind of capture

558
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,820
that packet we can do a replay attack

559
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,500
um change the bank account information

560
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,140
from that of the user to the attackers

561
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,179
and then the money will go to the wrong

562
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,120
bank account so this can be used for uh

563
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,000
for bigger hacks as well such as men in

564
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,799
the middle or by interacting with it so

565
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,039
the impact of this can be much bigger

566
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,960
now let's take a look at how something

567
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,240
like this will actually work the tool

568
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,520
that we like to use is Wi-Fi Fisher it's

569
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,320
very simple to run all you need to do is

570
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,900
run Wi-Fi Fisher attack e being the name

571
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,580
that you want to call your network in

572
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,780
this case we're calling it free Wi-Fi

573
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,820
then gives us some options of what type

574
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,960
of attack that we're going to be doing

575
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,520
what we're going to prompt the user to

576
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,919
try to trick them into doing once we do

577
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,660
that we get a little home menu that's

578
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,039
going to show us information about the

579
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,559
network and then going as live feed of

580
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,840
anybody connecting to our Network once

581
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,760
someone's connect the choice that we

582
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,200
gave them is to give a little pop-up

583
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,820
that asks them to enter the password to

584
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,620
update their Wi-Fi this can be

585
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,179
customized to be whatever kind of attack

586
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,220
or pop-up that you want in this case

587
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,500
this is what we chose to demonstrate so

588
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,360
from here it's just seemingly a

589
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,400
legitimate firmware upgrade asking them

590
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,080
to enter their password they're going to

591
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,720
enter it and click a start upgrade once

592
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,340
they enter that password we can see on

593
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,500
our screen in plain text the super

594
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,660
secret password that they entered and

595
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,640
from there we now have it and the user

596
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,660
is just going to be stuck with this

597
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,700
loading page until we close the network

598
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,160
connection and once we close it we can

599
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,080
still see the password there and now we

600
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,160
have the information that we can use

601
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,140
again this can be customized to do a

602
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,020
wide variety of

603
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,760
attacks and based on whatever kind of

604
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,200
information you're trying to leverage

605
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,160
and gain from the actual victim

606
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,179
all right so next story is about a

607
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:28,740
Russians about Russian spies and a group

608
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,260
that started um starting this attack

609
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,940
about driving around to different

610
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,240
buildings and hacking Wi-Fi's by

611
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,220
creating an evil twin which is something

612
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,860
that we'll explain in just a moment so

613
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,140
this is a National Intelligence group

614
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,120
that went around filled up their car

615
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,100
with a bunch of equipment and started

616
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,340
going um in near a proximity with like

617
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,260
targeted buildings

618
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,520
um the stuff that they had on their car

619
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,559
was a Wi-Fi pineapple which is a wi-fi

620
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,539
hacking tool in this case it was used to

621
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,580
so that they can make this the turn this

622
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,799
into an evil twin they use the high gain

623
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,480
directional Wi-Fi antenna this was used

624
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,720
as a booster so that the signal can go

625
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,919
further away to those buildings so let's

626
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,539
say they're in the parking lot or across

627
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:10,919
the street they want to make sure that

628
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,260
wherever this signal is going it's going

629
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,000
to be the strongest one so that users

630
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,340
can actually connect to it a 4G modem

631
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,740
which was used to get uh to provide

632
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,600
internet access to the Wi-Fi pineapple

633
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,700
as well as to all the users on those

634
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,260
buildings as well as a small computer

635
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,059
that was used for storage so they can

636
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,320
store all the information that they

637
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,299
stole from their victims now the way

638
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,600
that uh they worked is they used the uh

639
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,740
the signal boost to send D off frames to

640
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,960
those to those users say the user is

641
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,320
going to to a legitimate access point or

642
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,059
Wireless they're going to send the auth

643
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,020
packets they're going to get

644
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,059
de-authenticated and automatically

645
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,340
connected to the evil twin that they

646
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,500
have created this way they're able to

647
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,059
not only extract sensitive information

648
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,159
but they're also able to interact with

649
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,919
it by implanting back doors

650
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,440
um or just having access to their uh to

651
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,000
their Wi-Fi if they're persistent with

652
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,559
it

653
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,020
so let's take a look at what is

654
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,179
happening in this evil twin attack now

655
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,520
with the Rogue access point it relied on

656
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,500
us being able to trick a user into

657
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,020
joining the wrong Wi-Fi here we can

658
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,539
actually force a user to join our Wi-Fi

659
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,820
without having them to do without having

660
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,880
them to do anything so initially what's

661
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,500
going to happen is we have the safe

662
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,820
Wi-Fi in this case we're calling it the

663
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,500
company Wi-Fi that a user will already

664
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,659
be connected to using it as they

665
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,700
normally would then what an attacker is

666
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,799
going to do is create an identical Wi-Fi

667
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,659
not only are we going to replicate the

668
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,240
essid that network name but we're also

669
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,640
going to take the bssid that numeric

670
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,820
number and make a new network that is an

671
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,500
exact copy of that with those two

672
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,419
information pieces the same a computer

673
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,280
is going to see the same exact Network

674
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,419
and is not going to be able to

675
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,520
differentiate between the two so as a

676
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,679
result which everyone has the stronger

677
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,360
signal is going to be the one that is

678
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,039
being joined so

679
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,559
once an attacker is able to create an

680
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,780
identical system or identical Network

681
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,919
what they're going to do is they're

682
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,020
going to kick the user off of the safe

683
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,700
Wi-Fi sending these de-authentication

684
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,940
frames they send these user is now off

685
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,919
and as you normally would if you're ever

686
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,480
been disconnected your computer is going

687
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,940
to automatically try to reconnect to a

688
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,240
known trusted Wi-Fi but since this is

689
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,799
the same exact Wi-Fi we want to try to

690
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,600
get our Wi-Fi to be the one that they

691
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,580
automatically reconnect to so to do that

692
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,799
whichever signal is stronger

693
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,720
is what the victim's computer is going

694
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,840
to join so we boost our signal make ours

695
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,880
the stronger one and then

696
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,440
the signal will be established and

697
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,080
connected to our own network which is

698
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,400
that malicious evil Network okay let's

699
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,559
go over a breakdown of how this process

700
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,600
can be replicated in kala Linux we're

701
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,100
going to use some of the air Suite tools

702
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,600
that we talked about earlier more

703
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,740
specifically we're going to start with

704
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,500
Airman NG uh check kill

705
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,940
let's go ahead and play this so what

706
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,559
this is doing is going to check all the

707
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,120
processes that are currently running and

708
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,500
make sure that it kills any that is

709
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,480
going to stop us from creating the evil

710
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,620
twin

711
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,600
um we make sure that we are in

712
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,820
monitoring mode as well the moment that

713
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,880
we see wlan0 mod that means that we're

714
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,860
in modern mode W lens zero is just the

715
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,580
name of the interface

716
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:22,380
and that is showing there right now once

717
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,760
that runs we're able to see all the

718
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,919
available access points that are um

719
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,380
available we see the target one we see

720
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,880
Netgear 80 that's the one that we want

721
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,100
to create an evil twin for we grab the

722
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,500
bssid essid and that's all that we need

723
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,419
to run with our Command to create the

724
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,520
evil twin then

725
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,000
um we use that information to to use in

726
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,419
the air base NG um command we replace

727
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,240
the bssid the esid name and then we put

728
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,100
that in channel six we make sure we

729
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,659
include the interface that is in

730
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,279
monitoring mode and there we go we

731
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,679
already have an evil uh an evil twin

732
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,840
that is currently created at interface

733
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,900
uh at 0. if we do a quick if config we

734
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,340
see that it's already listed but no

735
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,340
Wireless extensions so we now have to

736
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,020
create a bridge to make sure that

737
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,059
they're connected our interface with

738
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:12,299
evil twin interface as well so we create

739
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:14,580
um a bridge which is called high in this

740
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,480
case

741
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,820
and we connected to both of the

742
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,299
endpoints so that um so they're

743
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:24,179
connected and then we have

744
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,700
where it's linked between our ethernet

745
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,460
and the evil twin and then uh we make

746
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,620
sure that it's up and running so that

747
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,559
the users connect the evil evil twin are

748
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,500
actually connected to the internet

749
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,419
what we do this is part of the process

750
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,279
of connecting the bridge or bridging

751
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,720
those two connections

752
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,480
and then we start to see the difference

753
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,159
we start to

754
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,919
um you do ifconfig to make sure that the

755
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,720
ha or the bridge is actually up and

756
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,140
running we see both interfaces e0 and

757
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,740
uh W lens zeromon so once those are up

758
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,679
we start monitoring for uh what kind of

759
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,840
new devices are actually logging into

760
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,020
the evil twin uh first we do DAC client

761
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,520
Hub which is basically taking that

762
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,700
bridge and uh firing up a DHC client the

763
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,559
am percent in the end it's just to put

764
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,779
it as a background process Cali will

765
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,100
just return the process number which

766
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,299
means it's there

767
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,480
so then they will have internet access

768
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,539
then we start monitoring uh if there are

769
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,460
any new devices that are connecting to

770
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,340
the evil um to the evil twin as we see

771
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,140
it's still working it's sending the auth

772
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,000
packets and

773
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,220
um on the other side we see the Netgear

774
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,880
80 uh essid client is associated and

775
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,480
connected

776
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,659
all right so how does this look in the

777
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,820
victim's side though this is how we set

778
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,919
it up this is how we set up evil twin

779
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,720
how we make sure that um that the victim

780
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,960
is connected and we now have access to

781
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,760
their Network traffic but how does it

782
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,020
look like for them

783
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,320
so if we have the Wi-Fi networks that

784
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,299
are available that are scanning

785
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,159
um if you notice here we're not clicking

786
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,659
anything we're just looking at it

787
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,179
Netgear 80 is already connected but just

788
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,700
uh the authenticates or disconnects on

789
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,679
its own what's happening is that's when

790
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,299
the D auth packets are actually playing

791
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:18,179
or going through and we're automatically

792
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,220
connecting it to the evil twin that

793
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,799
doesn't show here however on some

794
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,720
routers that have some security controls

795
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,120
implemented you will get a pop-up that

796
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,740
says that the Netgear 80 that you were

797
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,600
previously joined which is the exactly

798
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,000
the same exact essid

799
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,760
um was not open so that means that the

800
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,380
configurations of the evil twin were not

801
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,360
exactly the same like the original

802
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,760
access point this is a good thing

803
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,720
however

804
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,580
um for for somebody that wants to do

805
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,380
this type of attack we want to avoid it

806
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,240
so the way around that is to make sure

807
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,520
that every single configuration from the

808
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,919
original access point matches the evil

809
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,480
twin

810
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,880
and then what we do is we fire up

811
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,919
Wireshark to sniff some packets on the

812
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:00,659
bridge make sure that there is back is

813
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,520
going on and we're able to monitor the

814
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,500
traffic that is going in the bridge this

815
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,900
is where everything will happen from our

816
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,779
original ethernet connection to the evil

817
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,039
twin

818
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,260
um so then we start extracting

819
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,539
information from from here as well as

820
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,059
see if they have entered any sensitive

821
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,799
information such as passwords and things

822
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,158
like that

823
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,000
War flying so there are other fun ways

824
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,059
how we can hack Wi-Fi this is worth

825
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,679
flying this is a little

826
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,460
um

827
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,580
this is basically just using any flying

828
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,860
object usually it's an airplane or a

829
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,960
drone flying around with some Network

830
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,179
detectors to scan for Wi-Fi networks

831
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,279
most of the time this is more done for

832
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,320
uh reconnaissance so getting information

833
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,419
of like how many available Wi-Fi

834
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,059
networks are in a certain area however

835
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,440
um it can be it can have a lot of

836
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,399
advantages even for those that want to

837
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:58,740
get a large number of networks in a

838
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,880
large area and they don't want to be

839
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,380
walking around or driving around so

840
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,940
that's the main advantage however some

841
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,340
disadvantages are it's difficult to tell

842
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,620
where the wireless network is so you can

843
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,720
be flying around your drone around the

844
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,640
whole city but you won't have an exact

845
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,039
proximity of where that Wi-Fi network is

846
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,779
however there are some more advanced

847
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,640
drones that have built-in GPS

848
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,240
capabilities that can um can take care

849
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,100
of that one of the coolest uh events

850
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,779
that happen in the uh in the past with

851
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:28,200
drones was Skyjack this I believe was

852
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,659
discovered in 2018

853
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:33,620
um they basically programmed this um

854
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,020
this drone with a parrot operating

855
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,419
system it's a drone that has all the

856
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,100
other drones what it does is it goes

857
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,080
around flies around and then sees all

858
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,240
the other flying objects in this case

859
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,700
drones uh hopefully not airplanes they

860
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,380
will de-authenticate them or disconnect

861
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,020
them from the actual owner's wireless

862
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,539
access point and they'll make it connect

863
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:58,500
forcely connect to the um to this drone

864
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,240
and what that does is it turns into our

865
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,240
army of an army of um

866
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,299
drones that are controlled and monitored

867
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,580
by the same one so with one drone you

868
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,779
can hack all the other drones that may

869
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,580
be available in the area and you can

870
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,980
start replicating the same process so

871
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,960
then you can get way more information

872
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,899
around whole city

873
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,240
all right now for our last little attack

874
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,279
Vector I wanted to cover something that

875
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,720
was very different than all the previous

876
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,179
ones previously we're showing very

877
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,419
technical attacks trying to

878
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:31,980
evaluate a way in which we can bypass

879
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,020
something or break into something this

880
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,080
is taking a brute force method where it

881
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,360
is a hard so the Wi-Fi bubble is a

882
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,460
hardware tool it can range in size also

883
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,980
known as a signal jammer it can range in

884
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,720
size anything from something that can

885
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,220
fit in the size of your hand with a

886
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,080
range of 5 to 10 meters all the way up

887
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,000
to something that's backpack sized

888
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,220
that can go up to over a kilometer in

889
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,620
distance and Effectiveness so what these

890
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,000
things are going to be doing is it's

891
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,820
going to jam any radio frequencies that

892
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,740
you have it set to these can include

893
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,899
cell phones GPS Bluetooth and of course

894
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:07,919
Wi-Fi now the way this works is it is

895
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,960
going to emit signals that are on these

896
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,520
same frequencies loudly as with a lot of

897
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,679
force in relation to radio frequency

898
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,559
that essentially blocks out any normal

899
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:22,559
information from being passed so forcing

900
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,020
everything else to not be effective

901
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,440
there are now this is an extremely

902
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,600
dangerous item to have depending on

903
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,279
where you are in many places it is

904
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,899
extremely illegal just to possess

905
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:36,659
however there are legitimate use cases

906
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,779
for it for example if you aren't to have

907
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,700
something that is in a very

908
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,419
detailed um government building with

909
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:46,620
yes

910
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,899
yourself

911
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:51,720
exactly yes so areas in which you need

912
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,580
to prevent information from going in or

913
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,700
out of such as an exam test center or in

914
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,860
a government building you can use these

915
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,059
to prevent information from going in and

916
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,580
out of but there's also many illegal use

917
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,460
cases uh as can be seen in the upper

918
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,620
right Picture This is actually a picture

919
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,320
of a criminal who was being who used

920
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,600
this radio jamming frequency uh the

921
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,640
backpack sized one for a kilometer to

922
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,860
commit a crime and the reason that they

923
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,720
use signal Jammers and crimes normal

924
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,179
crimes everything from

925
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,820
theft to murder to robberies these kind

926
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,059
of crimes allow criminals more time to

927
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:28,679
commit the crime before being detected

928
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:31,440
if anything in this frequency bubble is

929
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,620
not able to use frequency no outward

930
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,440
calls can be made to Emergency Services

931
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,260
if there is a police officer or someone

932
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,120
they cannot call for backup if they're

933
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,100
in this area if there is an alarm that

934
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,419
is tripped it cannot send any

935
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,340
information outward to send responders

936
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,919
to so it allows more time for these

937
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,480
people to go and actually commit the

938
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,159
crimes now

939
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:56,039
again very very illegal and in the areas

940
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,659
that these have been seen they're really

941
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:00,240
trying to crack down on these on these

942
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,000
tools but it's just a very opposite

943
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,460
Spectrum to show all the devices and

944
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,779
attack methods that we've seen today

945
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,580
there are many different ways that you

946
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,619
can go about attacking Wi-Fi from as

947
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,359
blatant as Liz as just preventing it

948
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,159
from being used to being very technical

949
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,679
and trying to break into mathematically

950
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,780
how the actual wireless encryption can

951
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,399
work so there's a lot of different

952
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,719
options and there's a lot of different

953
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,399
methodologies and really we've only been

954
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,719
able to scratch the surface and what

955
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,319
we've covered today

956
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,859
any questions

957
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:35,820
let us know if you guys have any

958
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,740
questions thank you thank you

959
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:46,260
hi thank you both for the presentation I

960
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,839
had a less technical question is there

961
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,879
any Push by the European commission to

962
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,580
like remove the WPS button or to

963
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,000
deprecate the WPA features

964
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,099
uh I'm not sure if the European Union

965
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,780
has I know that they have a lot of like

966
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,720
privacy rules and a lot of uh they're

967
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,099
investing a lot of their security

968
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:07,320
research on implementing things like

969
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,720
that but I'm not quite sure if that's

970
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,760
something on their roadmap but it's a

971
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,760
good question thank you

972
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,619
yeah

973
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:20,000
sure I have another question

974
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,280
very short

975
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,060
thank you very much for your

976
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,180
presentation maybe you can give us let's

977
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,540
say an advice what would be

978
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,119
what we should use or what we should

979
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,540
think before we connect into any unknown

980
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,700
Network because all this seems

981
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,339
frightened so and all we hear are

982
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,500
connected so maybe an advice what we

983
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,180
should check before connecting to any

984
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,040
open network

985
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,680
now um I'll take this one it's okay okay

986
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,320
so now there is unfortunately no the way

987
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,880
that you can tell for sure if a wireless

988
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,740
network that is that you're scanning at

989
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,480
the airport for example you cannot know

990
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,339
for sure if it's an actual legitimate

991
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,200
access point or if it's a rogue access

992
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,780
point or an evil twin however what you

993
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,820
can do is um you know there's always

994
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,560
some red flags for example in captive

995
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,720
portals if it's asking hey where are you

996
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,800
going this is something that has nothing

997
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,380
to do with like a security check usually

998
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,060
we see like the Bots like make sure

999
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,400
you're not a robot those are usually uh

1000
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,440
the the those tend to be more the

1001
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,020
standard however another uh way that you

1002
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,060
can stay secure when you're not sure if

1003
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,780
the access point is legitimate using a

1004
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,400
VPN to make sure that all the traffic

1005
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,780
that's going through the internet is

1006
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,760
encrypted uh that way you can stay

1007
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,000
secure as well and never access the bank

1008
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,220
accounts or anything sensitive when you

1009
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,900
know in a public Wi-Fi that you're not

1010
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,740
sure

1011
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,540
um where it's coming from or how secure

1012
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,339
it is

1013
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:45,800
yes

1014
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,099
hi uh it was a very good presentation uh

1015
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:52,800
my question is uh how can you manage to

1016
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,079
deal with the compatibility of air crack

1017
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,820
and Airman on arm 64 uh architecture for

1018
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,579
example uh I have a Macbook M2 and I

1019
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:05,160
cannot uh get for example the

1020
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,859
compatibility between the aircraft and

1021
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,200
almond to work so do you recommend any

1022
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,380
devices to buy to make these tools work

1023
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,119
or do you have any solution that you've

1024
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,480
heard there

1025
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,300
obviously the tools are 10 or tend to

1026
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,160
work on what they were designed on uh

1027
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,980
the easy solution is to use a VM if you

1028
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,079
just download a Kali Linux VM oftentimes

1029
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,400
you'll be able to kind of use that or

1030
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,500
you can use remote Services as well to

1031
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,359
kind of utilize um additionally there

1032
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,980
are plenty of individual small hacking

1033
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,420
tools as mentioned we got that Wi-Fi

1034
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,339
pineapple and other tools that you can

1035
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,980
purchase to that are explicitly meant

1036
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,500
for the purpose of wi-fi hacking um so

1037
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,000
buying the small tools or you can get

1038
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,380
something as small as like a Raspberry

1039
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,720
Pi configure it to run Kali Linux and

1040
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,920
right from there you'll be able to

1041
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,339
create your own little hacking device

1042
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,880
yeah

1043
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,960
yeah so in that case you'll want to try

1044
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,240
to stick to external services so getting

1045
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,280
your own devices and configuring them

1046
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,960
there to have your own home lab or you

1047
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,820
can use remote services online that can

1048
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,020
kind of do those things for you as

1049
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,220
without having to use your own personal

1050
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,599
system

1051
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,200
thank you

1052
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,119
you have any other question yep real

1053
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,780
give me a second

1054
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,900
so thank you very much for the

1055
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,579
presentation uh I just had the question

1056
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:27,599
because

1057
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,240
um I mean you kind of answer it but I'm

1058
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,520
I haven't played with wi-fi hacking in a

1059
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,640
while so for the evil twin attack so

1060
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,920
basically when you get the notification

1061
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,460
that oh this let's say this access point

1062
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,099
was actually a vpa to an hour connecting

1063
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,599
to an access point that's not password

1064
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,180
protected and I saw it was on Mac is

1065
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,160
does window has Windows done something

1066
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,200
similar or it will just automatically

1067
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,760
reconnect to the same name without

1068
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,640
asking before when when I last did that

1069
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,260
it was like that but apparently it's

1070
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,660
changed so I'm not sure if you guys have

1071
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,700
any information about that

1072
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,140
um we have actually only tested it on

1073
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,180
Mac so I'm not really sure I would

1074
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,500
assume they would do something similar

1075
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,660
but um it depends on the operating

1076
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,820
system we're talking Windows is it a

1077
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,280
1997 windows or is it like a Windows 11

1078
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,839
you know that is updated has all the

1079
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,520
security controls so it depends on the

1080
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,079
operating system if it's been updated

1081
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,520
and if it has those security features

1082
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,280
implemented I know that Windows 11 has

1083
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,320
done a lot of work in you know their

1084
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,240
security recently so I would assume they

1085
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,640
do but we haven't tested it thank you

1086
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,540
you're welcome

1087
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,020
[Music]

1088
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,680
do I see any hands up no

1089
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,859
thank you
