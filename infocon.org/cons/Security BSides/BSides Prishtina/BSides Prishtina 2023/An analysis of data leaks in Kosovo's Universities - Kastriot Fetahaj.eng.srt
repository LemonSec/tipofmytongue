1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,100
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,280
um maybe I've seen the players when my

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,500
original speech has different name and

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,719
different topic maybe all of you but

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,940
what happened really I found a major

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,160
vulnerability in one of the fintech

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,840
companies and we report like three

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,539
months ago and after that I started my

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,400
presentation that I'm gonna present here

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,740
I meant to present it to present it here

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,680
and say we are good to go but phone

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,840
certainly on Friday I receive email and

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,660
can say we cannot show it we cannot show

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,940
it because there's gonna damage our

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,640
reputation as a company and my affect

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,780
our clients

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,200
so we decide to switch the Swizzle topic

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,059
and I hope all of you will like this

19
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,340
this one since we are in University I

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,420
have been studying in this University

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,480
too I decided to do something related to

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,120
data lease and University so I hope you

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,860
will like this

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,239
okay

25
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,219
uh just a short introduction I

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,019
understand that I am cyber student

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,119
engineer a doorman career I've been

28
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,619
working as a cyber security engineer

29
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,140
software developer and quality assurance

30
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,740
engineer uh I have been working in cyber

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,380
security industry since I was 12 so most

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,960
of the guys who are here as a presenter

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,380
or as a attendees start working cyber

34
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,060
security when they are young like sales

35
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,460
or teens so it's been like 20 years

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,880
working on it and during my uh

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,320
experience in my career have been

38
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,299
participating in a lot of competitions

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,100
and

40
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,479
here are

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,880
some of them live I won

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,520
and probably a person don't like them

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,460
because I used to beat their students

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,159
okay but we all sorted like most of you

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,380
students I'm here this is a picture of

46
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,280
me at 2011 with the process and some of

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,000
my colleagues like most of you in a

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,159
university we all start with the Russell

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,140
bearing but participate in conferences

50
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,439
this is the conference from 2011 it's a

51
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,419
Microsoft conference and after that the

52
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,280
moving career like developing and

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,860
evolving we decide

54
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,500
okay what what this uh presentation will

55
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,260
contain uh we will talk about data leaks

56
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,540
and data data Bridges we will talk the

57
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,420
tools that I've been using to make an

58
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,580
analysis about that collection about the

59
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,099
university we will talk the how I

60
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,560
managed to make samples of emails and

61
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,660
testing them we will talk about the

62
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,840
analogy reports impact of that and we

63
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,540
have some conclusion and Q a session

64
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,920
inland

65
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,239
so for for you all uh that are not very

66
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,180
familiar with data leaks data leaks is

67
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,720
uh sending or showing commercial data to

68
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,640
a third party without authorization for

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,519
example if you are a company who shared

70
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,959
data to a third party without

71
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,819
authorization or clients data without

72
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,099
our authorization this is known as a

73
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,080
data leak one of the biggest data leaks

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,660
is known or commercial analytica maybe

75
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,060
you know Trump can campaign when they

76
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,800
use the Facebook data to to make

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,260
advertisements and there are some other

78
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,300
stuff that Facebook actually have killed

79
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,239
and data breach is uh incident

80
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,580
confirming accident that a company

81
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,560
confirmed that sensitive data have been

82
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,800
leaked at our public or maybe non-public

83
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,080
but they are in Internet that people can

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
buy or find in a way someone with data

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,159
leaks during the ages or Myspace is one

86
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,340
of the first ones LinkedIn Yahoo Adobe

87
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,580
Facebook had had big data League about

88
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,560
four numbers and all stuffs in the in

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,440
the previous or so a lot a lot of big

90
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,760
companies have faced this kind of

91
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,260
Excellence

92
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,920
foreign

93
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,459
[Applause]

94
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,440
and for you folks in Universe to have

95
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,420
shown is the service that you can check

96
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,580
your email if it's leaked in a any data

97
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,799
Bridges or not and the other one is

98
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,400
combo list it's a a combo this is a

99
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,080
combination on a username of password of

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,959
many data leaks that have been data

101
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,220
regions that have been linked during the

102
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,220
years and it has like 3.8 billion

103
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,738
combination of usernames and password

104
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,019
for for analyzing the emails I've been

105
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,419
using this service to see if you emails

106
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,040
have been leaked but for analyzing

107
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,320
password patterns and other stuff I've

108
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,419
been using this combo list I will show

109
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,840
in details in the next slides

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,160
so just a deeper explanation uh how I've

111
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,860
been Pawn is a website that is uh

112
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,500
developed by Troy Hunt is a Australian

113
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,600
researcher and you know what can do what

114
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,919
you can do there you can put your email

115
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,780
and see the result if you have been

116
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,240
leading in any data Bridges and

117
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,820
currently it sounds like the 12.5

118
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,600
billion credentials on his database

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,699
for example if you put my mail you can

120
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,120
see my email have at least in a 17 data

121
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,820
breaches so most of us who have been

122
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,740
using the email for a long period of

123
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,479
time probably they may have been leaked

124
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,400
for all of us but it depends how we

125
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,580
handle that and that the uh this

126
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,500
presentation is about how we should

127
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,660
handle the leaks because sometimes you

128
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,520
cannot start Facebook from leaking your

129
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,280
data or or other big companies uh

130
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,500
uh comma combo box is like this it's a

131
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,560
huge like 100 gigabytes of combination

132
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,720
username and password and even the

133
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,759
people who made it that have made even a

134
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,699
shell script who is a lit indexed uh

135
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,180
files who can help you uh to search

136
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,039
faster so for example you just put

137
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,960
emails and uh you will see your email

138
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,380
and the password for that or in this

139
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,419
database search example for example if

140
00:05:57,419 --> 00:05:59,699
you put email here's email here's a

141
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,500
password they are just a random picture

142
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,919
not a real data that I have done during

143
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:09,780
the this uh uh analyzing so uh

144
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,560
the analyzing was about University first

145
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,479
of all I thought to do is were

146
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,520
governments but governments was very

147
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,780
sensitive uh uh institution and might

148
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,400
have problems with them so I did with

149
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,639
universities and they are the the emails

150
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,960
that I I did I did for three

151
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,060
universities a b

152
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,139
uh ubt and public university and here

153
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,479
are the the samples I managed to find

154
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,139
this kind of emails uh in the public

155
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,600
internet using a technique called email

156
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,240
harvesting so I didn't get the list of

157
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,220
emails from the universities that say

158
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,620
here's the emails you can test again and

159
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,479
provide us report but I use email

160
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,819
harvesting that is a it's a technique of

161
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,340
finding public emails using Google or

162
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,720
other uh uh search genes and you can see

163
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,520
there are some a b stuff Wireless

164
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,740
because University of pristine and ubt

165
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,560
use the same domain for uh staffs and

166
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,840
and students but they be have different

167
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,300
domains so I managed to to divide into

168
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,360
two categories of stuffs and uh and the

169
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,840
shooters so there are the steps that I

170
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,280
actually like conduct to make this

171
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
analyze uh one of them is to analyze

172
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,979
email if they are part of uh leaks and

173
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,319
have I been pawned after that check the

174
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,599
credential

175
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,479
stuff in in a combo list analyze Puzzler

176
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,259
patterns uh showing the results based on

177
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,500
that and if the result are not enough

178
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,620
for universities I contact them and say

179
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,599
if you want to see a real impact you

180
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,099
have to give me permission to show your

181
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,080
real impact and one of the universe they

182
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
actually accept this tutorial pattern

183
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,280
after that we did password spraying

184
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,539
techniques that is technical brute

185
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,699
portion all the emails and passwords and

186
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,139
after that we show the impact that you

187
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,060
will see in a upcoming slides

188
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,300
so the first concept is to grab every

189
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,720
mail and try if they mail is lit or not

190
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,419
and the response to that will show you a

191
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:16,740
result like this for example my email

192
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,500
has been lifting as 17 Bridges and here

193
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,599
are some of them but doing this manually

194
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,879
for more than 3000 ml is probably going

195
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,819
to be gonna be uh hard repeatable this

196
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,639
job and it's not fun so what what the

197
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,919
have I been Pawn provide they provide

198
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,520
the paid API so you can just write a

199
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,919
python script or anything you want and

200
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,559
you can automate it and save the result

201
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,020
in any type you want like database or

202
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,540
any filo so I did what I did I write a

203
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,760
python script try all emails the result

204
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,040
I saved in the database and after that

205
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,640
and I analyze them and this is a general

206
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,899
report from uh 2 900 emails like almost

207
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,980
49 of them has been leaked so the the

208
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,100
percentage of them is 50 50 almost 50

209
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,300
there

210
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,420
and here you can check comparison

211
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,640
between the universities can you see the

212
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,240
university a B has more than 50

213
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,140
the ubt has more than 60 percent and you

214
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,440
uh the public university had like uh 42

215
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,500
percent of leaks the column red

216
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,899
colonists image that can be leaked green

217
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,200
or not leaked so and even the staff of a

218
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,360
b like is like more than 80 percent of

219
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,839
them and I'm talking uh here we have to

220
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,940
to know I'm talking for for the emails I

221
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,160
had probably the university might have

222
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,800
like two uh 20 000 emails and maybe some

223
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,959
of them are lease or not but I have only

224
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,399
some amount of mail for analyzing

225
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,320
because I didn't get officially from the

226
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,120
from the University

227
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,660
and

228
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,800
they are the sources that you can

229
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,920
believe for example uh when analyze

230
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,320
where the sources what are the sources

231
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,540
that the data has been leaked I find out

232
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,580
that most of the universities share like

233
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,680
common sources for example one of them

234
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,160
is Nitro uh June bash they are PDF

235
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,860
readers and other stuff and we're going

236
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,640
to go is one uh one by one uh

237
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,160
most of the emails was leaked like you

238
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,000
can see here four uh 441 emails in Nitra

239
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,760
Nitro is a PDF reader that actually have

240
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,720
been breached in 2020 and they have been

241
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,600
like 77 million emails and and

242
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,760
credential leaks and one of the data

243
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,279
that had been linked there are email uh

244
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,019
names and password very important

245
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,220
passwords

246
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,420
uh

247
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,579
the second one is Doom bash that is

248
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:47,180
visual messaging services

249
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,100
similar to the first one has believed in

250
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,420
2018 and he had Elite like uh 161

251
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,880
million data

252
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,160
you can see the data here one of them is

253
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,100
a password and email address too very

254
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,440
important for our for our analyzing and

255
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,339
for our password spraying technique uh

256
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,800
similar to neutral and all application

257
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,920
is a lonely PDF that

258
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,260
because most of the students and

259
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,779
professors based on the results we can

260
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,600
see they use three PDF readers and they

261
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,040
have probably download this application

262
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,680
and this application probably has

263
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,920
required a user to download them and

264
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,260
here are the data that has been linked

265
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,339
email and passwords including two

266
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:37,980
is a kind of a more older or older

267
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,920
application is is Facebook application

268
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,320
maybe on I don't know if you're familiar

269
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,940
with a Facebook application it's

270
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,000
application based on Facebook and it was

271
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
a this kind of application that you

272
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,240
decide with with what famous person you

273
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,500
are look like or something like that

274
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,899
maybe you saw that silly old application

275
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,480
2016 and

276
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,540
there are a lot of females uh lifting

277
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,640
this application too

278
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,760
uh this is another PDL it's another

279
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,579
combo list that that include a lot of

280
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:15,360
emails and is leading in 2019 and it has

281
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,420
emails and uh and uh but no password

282
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,079
here so

283
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,279
uh what the app is another application

284
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,880
that has been literally are 72 emails

285
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,120
leaked here from all the universities uh

286
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,760
Lincoln strapper is not a data Breeze

287
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,560
but it was scrapping technique that you

288
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,800
that someone has does scrap all the

289
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,980
users and they are this amount of data

290
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,060
that can be leaked here but even this

291
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,040
league doesn't include password it's not

292
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,380
very very danger but of course there are

293
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,240
some other personal data too

294
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,139
and melway is a math oriented

295
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,060
application that probably students has

296
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,560
been using to solve the problems the

297
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,360
challenge in University and they are

298
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,560
like uh 63 events leaked in in this uh

299
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,519
platform too

300
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,060
canva is a designing tool maybe the

301
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,540
designers and Architects that use and

302
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,680
it's recently in 2019 and from our

303
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,940
samples of emails there have been 61

304
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,720
emails leaking list too and house is a

305
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,300
designing house this is more about the

306
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,839
architect things and they are 49 emails

307
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,060
leaked in this uh

308
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,820
data source uh two this okay this remote

309
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,380
is not working very well so I have to

310
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,779
click a couple of times so uh you can

311
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,600
see for a b they are top 10 sources that

312
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,660
being leaked similar to a b the ubt have

313
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,720
similar things so maybe the first or

314
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,180
second place are swapping but pretty

315
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,620
much our same same things and same for

316
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,639
uh uh a public university

317
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,579
and for the professors and staff senior

318
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,399
a b was different because uh they

319
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,680
believed in not in a this kind of

320
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,480
application than public students have

321
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,360
handled leaks so it was but was what was

322
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,279
one was this MyFitnessPal it looks like

323
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,160
some of the staffs are doing diets in a

324
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,819
b so

325
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,560
and this is the most common password

326
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,220
that I have been analyzing on that so

327
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,860
the common password probably are similar

328
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,560
to most of the common passwords that are

329
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,600
using in different categories for people

330
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,180
not the students and professors one two

331
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,700
three one two three password one to nine

332
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,220
phone number phone number I have put in

333
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,199
a brackets because different formats or

334
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,180
phone number including prefix with

335
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,760
dashes with lines with spaces uh

336
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,740
birthdays first and last name

337
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,160
combination of them like a capital first

338
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,399
name lower so this kind of and there are

339
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,699
two passwords that actually break the

340
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,639
algorithm kind of this uh list two in

341
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,199
the lab all right

342
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,940
because

343
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,800
emails that they have been leaked and

344
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,180
that probably have been leaked in many

345
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,360
stores like 100 sources and if a guy had

346
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,459
the email and all the passwords have the

347
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,040
same and have lived in the 100 sources

348
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,399
it kind of a kind of a master data

349
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,800
because if you have like 10 students

350
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,899
that have been deleting two sources and

351
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,000
have different puzzle but you have a

352
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
student that have been leaking 100

353
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,019
sources that has always a similar this

354
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,660
kind of passwords showing top 10 because

355
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,220
is one person but in in many leaks

356
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,980
and after that I decide okay this all

357
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,680
the result I will email the universities

358
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,899
the department of I.T that all the

359
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,839
university has and show the emails uh

360
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,019
show the leaks and tell them to inform

361
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,600
students and and professors to change

362
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,519
the password to see if they still have

363
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,899
this kind of creditors and all that

364
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:01,620
stuff but I I got this funny response

365
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,600
yeah thank you for reporting that but I

366
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,720
don't see impact on that okay I say do

367
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,720
you want to see impact I asked them do

368
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,579
you want to see impact and one of the

369
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,740
University a b said yes we want to see

370
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,740
impact okay what I did I did password

371
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,560
spring so I get all the emails from AV

372
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,260
and all the password from a b and did

373
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:27,420
The Brute Force like like uh all uh all

374
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,800
the password for all the emails like

375
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,600
you're shown in diagram for example the

376
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,160
password is one two three other five

377
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,320
with all the emails a next buzzword for

378
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,420
all their emails and the impact was like

379
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,540
this

380
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,240
if it doesn't look fun

381
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,620
this is

382
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,240
this is an all Impact this is a

383
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,940
professor

384
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,519
and this is a model when the professors

385
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,480
put Grace for students for exams

386
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,820
of course we report them all of them are

387
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,699
fixed and probably for now they are safe

388
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,339
but they have we have some conclusions

389
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:04,919
uh that uh we produce from from

390
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,980
researchers like 49 of emails that we

391
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,780
analyze for University have been leaked

392
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,059
at least in one source

393
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:15,240
uh universities do not do cyber security

394
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,140
trainings not only for students or or or

395
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,599
cyber security awarenesses not only for

396
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,900
students but even for our staffs because

397
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,299
uh when we reason with the email exam

398
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,640
and said okay this is saying these are

399
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,500
the leaks and you have to inform them to

400
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,080
say there is no impact only when we show

401
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,820
the impact they say oh this is a real

402
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,100
deal now we have to do something and the

403
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,799
third conclusion is that universities do

404
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,980
not do data Lake monitoring that most of

405
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,220
banks around another governments should

406
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,919
do so they don't do data leaks

407
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,380
monitoring and probably if some of the

408
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,799
credentials have been leaked in the uh

409
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,299
dark internet or public internet they

410
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,240
are not aware of that so

411
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,520
this is all if anyone have a question

412
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,600
feel free to ask

413
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,600
thank you that was great does anybody

414
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,160
has any questions yeah of course person

415
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,539
because I have to do with your

416
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,960
universities

417
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,780
thank you very much for your

418
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,820
presentation and for your talk really

419
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,679
inspiring see all this work that you

420
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,559
have done uh just I think my students

421
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,780
know you all ready because we are using

422
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,059
your let's say results from your

423
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:33,000
Bachelor thesis uh Castro did an awesome

424
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,520
work on his Bachelor thesis just

425
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,799
focusing on University of Pristina and

426
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,480
of course his Bachelor thesis is closed

427
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,880
it's not for public we have sent all the

428
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,740
recommendation that been outcome from

429
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,080
his thesis to the information center

430
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,179
Universal Pristina they have taken

431
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,919
someone accounts I think some of them

432
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,200
already patched some of them are still

433
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,440
not but they are still there uh

434
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,080
regarding the question I think you

435
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,179
concretely stopped to the impact and

436
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,919
this is important because it doesn't

437
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,539
make sense researching something without

438
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:07,500
impact uh coming back to the impact

439
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,299
you said that you done the impact only

440
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,500
for a b

441
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,000
what is the impact for other

442
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,919
universities because leaking so much

443
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,280
information and as we know many users

444
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,799
tend to have the same email address and

445
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,440
probably the same password in many sites

446
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,080
many accounts that's a huge impact can

447
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,000
you maybe share something what about

448
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,980
other institution about the impact yes

449
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,600
I know I'm aware of sharing some more

450
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,100
information not only for a viewers

451
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,100
University but for the banks do actually

452
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,280
I did this kind of analyze analytics for

453
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,720
for banks

454
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,320
two and one of my reporters report that

455
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,539
I've done like a previous year uh for

456
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,299
rafaction Bank in Kosovo and the impact

457
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,240
was this this kind of lease and that to

458
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,940
full compromising of internal internal

459
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,880
uh uh infrastructure so the impact

460
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,340
doesn't mean to be just a male of

461
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,140
students that way someone can access and

462
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,080
can see the result of him doing studies

463
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,280
but impact it can very depends on what

464
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,860
what system does the universities use

465
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,840
and other stuff but the worst thing in

466
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,860
this this thing is because most of the

467
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,600
institution nothing not only

468
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,000
universities but even governments and

469
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,840
some uh private companies do not like to

470
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,280
see and just accept that as a risk so we

471
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,220
have a kind of a very formal famous

472
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,020
school to say there are two type of

473
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,760
peoples people who have been hacked and

474
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,080
people who have been hacked that don't

475
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,720
know that they have been nice so most of

476
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,240
the time you cannot stop big companies

477
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,280
from leaking your information because

478
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,860
you you cannot do anything but what you

479
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,299
can do is Monitor them and take a take

480
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,200
action based on the potential impact can

481
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,039
can be only

482
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,400
okay let me go to spend he has another

483
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,179
question for you

484
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,020
because

485
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,900
thank you for the presentation

486
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,580
um did I understand it correctly that

487
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,820
you used passwords from breaches to to

488
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,140
do the password spring is that correct

489
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,120
well I can't hear you very well can you

490
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,179
repeat please did you use passwords from

491
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:30,179
the breaches to do password spraying yes

492
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:33,179
because we as I mentioned during

493
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,760
presentation I use the password because

494
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,280
we kind of have a deal from the one of

495
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,500
the universities do you want to see a

496
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,020
real impact can we we did the SLA well

497
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,179
done can we do it because if you use

498
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,820
password and you manage to to

499
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,260
authenticate let's say illegal activity

500
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,620
so you have to have the uh so the first

501
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,200
part of analyzing the emails and leaks

502
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,960
is aware of public data there is no harm

503
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,240
on it and you can show us a result but

504
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,700
if you use a credentices to log in on

505
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,760
them and brute force on the account this

506
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,559
activity that actually if you don't have

507
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,840
it does it doesn't if you don't have a

508
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,400
permission to do it it's a illegal

509
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,799
activity and no one should do it so

510
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,320
thank you so the actual question is

511
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,140
um how did you get those passwords I got

512
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,299
the password from the combination uh

513
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,940
combo list that I show in the first

514
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,760
presentation is like 3.8 million

515
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,220
combination of of the username and

516
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,780
password that is lit in 2021 that combo

517
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,840
I have that Converse about uh 100

518
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,260
gigabytes of them and I just for every

519
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,480
mail I search on it and grab the

520
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,100
password saving database and after that

521
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,780
I make a combination between the emails

522
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,700
and password and try and issue them a

523
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,200
support Force attack

524
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,480
so the so the passwords from the

525
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,539
breaches were I assume hashed insulted

526
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,020
no uh actually what is a combo list is

527
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,539
plant tax companies it's not hashes so

528
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,220
what people have done during the a

529
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,880
during the time they for example if they

530
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,480
have a gallon database of the uh Nitro

531
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,940
most of the passwords that are hashed

532
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,580
but they have uh tried using rainbow

533
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,280
tables to dehash them and after that

534
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,159
some organizations or companies have

535
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,280
collected uh unhashed password from this

536
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,140
database and listen listen this and make

537
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,380
a huge list it's a similar what uh rock

538
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,659
you rock you

539
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,419
um award list about cracking things but

540
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,580
this is about Campbell is that include

541
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,460
emails and passwords

542
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,380
does anybody else has any question

543
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,320
okay

544
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,799
uh I think that's just stressed out very

545
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,840
good but I won't put this very clearly

546
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,960
if you log into a system we thought you

547
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,820
don't have permission this is illegal

548
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,760
activity in Kosovo you can go to jail

549
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,140
you can go in jail yes you can go in

550
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,480
jail so be careful on this castroot is

551
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,700
one of the ethical hackers in Kosovo and

552
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,159
in any conference more than decade we

553
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,360
are raising this issue to the

554
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,640
governments and I think now by the new

555
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,580
low this you can get some uh Bounty or

556
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,620
you can get some uh let's say fee on

557
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,200
that but till now this is illegal

558
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,840
activity so if you have a user username

559
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,240
and password and you have allowance to

560
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,059
do enter it if you're doing this you're

561
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,520
doing illegal activity in Kosovo so be

562
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,220
aware of this

563
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,200
what the professor is saying uh testing

564
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,600
platforms public platforms is a illegal

565
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,880
activity by the law in Kosovo so you can

566
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,580
you are able to test only if you have

567
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,720
the SLA before starting the testing and

568
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,880
us as a cyber security committee we find

569
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,299
very difficult to find to find to make a

570
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,159
uh this kind of agreements for testing

571
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,799
especially with government but since our

572
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,780
community we have some friends and most

573
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,120
of the reports and Agreements are more

574
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,240
like a friendly agreements than like uh

575
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,880
when I reported that University I know I

576
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,159
knew the who's the head of the idea that

577
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,559
uh Public University I know who's had

578
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,960
the right thing to others University I

579
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,100
cannot do this kind of testing for uh

580
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,260
universities or organizations that you

581
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,700
have no relation with them we're

582
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,140
probably going to sue you and probably

583
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,539
gonna end up in prison so it's very

584
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,320
important to know that
