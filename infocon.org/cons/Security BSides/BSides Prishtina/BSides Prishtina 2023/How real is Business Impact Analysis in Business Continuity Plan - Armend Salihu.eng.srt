or is yours hi everyone uh so my

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,120
presentation is uh how real is this

business impact analysis which is uh

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,280
main part of business continuity plan uh

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,580
salio this is a serious

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,760
mccse and copy 35 certified also work

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,920
inside the auditor at NLB bank here

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,480
Christina

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,060
uh my presentation is different from

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,439
others since it's not technical

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,420
presentation but more physical

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,219
presentation

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,800
uh so what is business path analysis uh

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,360
business impact analysis is a process

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,300
that identifies and evaluates so the

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,399
potential part of interruption to

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,140
critical business processes and business

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,760
functions

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,800
uh what is the purpose of business

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,200
impact analysis the main purpose is so

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,239
to provide the framework for developing

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,699
a comprehensive plan for responding to

24
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,940
those uh events also uh to assess

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,160
potential impact of disruption both

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,920
internal and external past that

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,380
institution they had

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,040
many organizations today claim that they

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,500
have a comprehensive Business Park

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,299
analysis which is part of business

31
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,060
continuity plan uh as part of their

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,740
Disaster Recovery or business continuity

33
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,200
management process

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,020
color uh the question is how real is

35
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,600
this business impact analysis and this

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,659
is actually uh deliver the desired

37
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,880
outcomes uh to answer this question

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,700
usually we have to consider uh the

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,380
factors that contribute to the thickness

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,939
effectiveness of business impact

41
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,220
analysis

42
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,340
firstly business impact analysis must be

43
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,840
conducted with a clear understanding of

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,040
the organization called the critical

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,820
business function and processes uh also

46
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,000
that has to be included involves the

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,460
main stakeholders of the organization

48
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,880
like Business Leaders uh process owners

49
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,880
or Business Leaders departmentally hats

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,000
and subject matter experts have to be

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,560
included

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,598
since without this involvement business

53
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,180
impact analysis uh members critical

54
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,739
elements and leading to an effective

55
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,360
planning

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,599
secondly business impact analysis must

57
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,160
be conducted using rigorous and

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,239
well-defined methodologies uh as well as

59
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,620
well-known standards in order to be

60
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,260
comprehensive and cover all the

61
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,060
uh uh partition pattern online or

62
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,319
identified and evaluated

63
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,420
this requires a comprehensive risk

64
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,920
assessments maybe we cannot do anything

65
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,900
that causes both internal and external

66
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,480
such cyber attacks on natural disaster

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,599
as well as supply chain disruptions

68
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,239
business impact analysis must be an

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,040
ongoing process not one time process

70
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,560
it's a living document uh we have to

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,379
update on every change every process the

72
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:02,879
changes within the institution we have

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,620
to update our business impact analysis

74
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,200
uh which reflects in a business

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,599
continuing international plan uh this

76
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,680
change includes critical business

77
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,720
function processes as well as changes in

78
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,120
general external threats and risk

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,500
factors that have been identified

80
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,819
in my opinion which is based on several

81
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,640
researchers read uh business impact

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,260
analysis can be highly effective tool

83
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,760
for organization when conducted

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,700
correctly it requires significant

85
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,040
investment of time and resources and but

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,720
this must be viewed as an ongoing

87
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,180
processor rather than one-time process

88
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,580
however we have not yet to answer the

89
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,000
question of this presentation

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,680
what are the factors that we have to

91
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,659
consider uh while preparing business

92
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,420
impact analysis uh the key factors are

93
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,799
critical criticality of business

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,819
processes uh recovery time objectives

95
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,140
research requirements interdependence

96
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,940
and risk assessment communication

97
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,620
coordination as well as testing and

98
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,480
validation also there are several other

99
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,940
factors uh lateral workers than those

100
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,580
however in this presentation we will be

101
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,340
focused on recovery time objectives and

102
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,480
in a testing and validation

103
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,660
uh part of that we will mention several

104
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,279
random standards that are applied on

105
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,860
business content management as well as

106
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,139
in business impact analysis the first

107
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:30,560
one is ISO 22 301 which is uh business

108
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,360
continuity management system and covers

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,639
also business impact analysis in this

110
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,220
standard another standard is British

111
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,320
standard number

112
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,520
25 999

113
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,380
another standard is NFPA 1 600 which is

114
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,840
uh standard developed by National Fire

115
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,120
Protection Association in the United

116
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,560
States uh also Asa

117
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,280
as i s

118
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,139
uh spsc one 2009 uh standard uh

119
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,180
developed by American Society for for

120
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,600
institutional security

121
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,400
another standard which is developed by

122
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,880
the United Arab Embraces ncema uh 7000

123
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,300
also uh uh business continuity Institute

124
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,360
good practice guidelines which is a best

125
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,539
practice to be implemented during

126
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,440
preparation of business Continuum

127
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,479
management as well as business impact

128
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,539
analysis performed uh these standards

129
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:37,919
provide business with a set of

130
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,320
guidelines to help them develop uh and

131
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,940
implement the effectiveness country

132
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,639
plans ensuring that they are prepared

133
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,560
for potential disruption and able to

134
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,840
continue operations during the entire

135
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,000
research events

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,740
even though the above mentioned

137
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,080
standards are very comprehensive do they

138
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,660
address all the factors a human

139
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,780
psychological concept is not foreseen in

140
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,880
all of the standards including others

141
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
not mentioned here so we have to

142
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,900
consider this

143
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,120
related to the recovery time objectives

144
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,479
rtos will discuss two following cases

145
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,520
which were performed by a friend of mine

146
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,660
who is performing PhD in Psychology

147
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,180
especially in the I.T industry in

148
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,699
banking sector in Asia and Africa

149
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,380
he encountered several cases but we

150
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,900
mentioned two interesting cases that we

151
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,000
saw during our interview with the

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,680
process owner a case in Malaysia

153
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,360
where bank had a Cyber attack and the uh

154
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,720
of all maintenance data center went down

155
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,240
so they have had to operate from the

156
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,360
secondary data center however uh the key

157
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,560
responsible stuff for business

158
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,080
continuity management received a loan

159
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,220
call that his family was kidnapped so he

160
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,240
was unable to uh perform uh all the uh

161
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,759
understood steps to recover on time so

162
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,520
he missed the recovery time objectives

163
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,259
and the light as I remember uh three

164
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:17,220
times more than it was foreseen in the

165
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,319
internal acts related to this business

166
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,419
consuming management

167
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,880
another case that we counter during our

168
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,199
interview we had in Japan uh back in

169
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,259
Japan uh located its maintenance Data

170
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,539
Center and minus one floor honestly

171
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,819
speaking it was the worst decision to

172
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,180
put on the minus one floor uh the main

173
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,780
Data Center and uh even worse of a

174
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,720
electric supply was on the floor so they

175
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,580
had a

176
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,819
uh water flow did on pavat and a key

177
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,539
staff of it were locked inside he he

178
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:58,500
couldn't escape from that place uh even

179
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,660
though the ID guy was not part of the

180
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,520
business County management uh they were

181
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,780
unable to uh activate business continue

182
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,340
business continuity plan and Disaster

183
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,740
Recovery Center from the secondary data

184
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,460
center since they were very engaged to

185
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,520
help the IT guy to leave that space

186
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,039
related to testing a validation we'll

187
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,180
provide the case of flight uh one uh

188
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,879
1549 have you watched Sully Miracle on

189
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,740
the Hudson movie If I strongly recommend

190
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,719
to watch this movie it's based on uh the

191
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,240
U.S Airways flight uh 1549 emergency

192
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,820
landing in January 2009 by captain

193
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,660
salmonberg

194
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,300
the captain was advised to land on the

195
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,540
LaGuardia in the airport when he

196
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,820
deported or in total Borough another

197
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,880
near airport where did he land the

198
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,279
Airbus A320

199
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,120
and Hudson River

200
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,360
and why I mentioned this movie

201
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,320
which is based on the real case is that

202
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,300
after the incident of the company suit

203
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,940
their Capital that he could have safely

204
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,480
landed in both uh LaGuardia or total

205
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,300
Borough airports and they performed

206
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,940
several tests as I remember 37 testing

207
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,120
but the Capitan could have landed safely

208
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,279
in both airports however on the on the

209
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,180
last uh us for the sense of the Judgment

210
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,120
he requested to add also psychological

211
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,399
human factor on testing environment

212
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,760
after adding that uh he couldn't land in

213
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,680
total Boro nor in LaGuardia so he won

214
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,339
the case and started working

215
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:55,560
also on the same company

216
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,700
uh he was working

217
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,080
recently in my institution where I work

218
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,519
we performed uh

219
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,740
resource recovery plan and we worked

220
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,899
several days from our secondary class

221
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,240
Center uh several days uh total

222
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,279
switchover of the main data center uh

223
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,680
results were more than perfect of delay

224
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,339
was uh foreseen about four hours and the

225
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,040
of activation was in less than 10

226
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,220
minutes very perfect however we have to

227
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,440
add that we prepared two weeks earlier

228
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,480
for that and so uh if we have a case uh

229
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,680
unexpected would we be able to activate

230
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,100
I don't think so not our company that I

231
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,440
work but a majority of mid-range

232
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,200
companies would be unable to activate

233
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,060
the secondary Center on time if it's not

234
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,100
considered human uh psychological

235
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,480
concept

236
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,360
so on your conclusion uh wild business

237
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,399
impact analysis may not be a solar

238
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,120
ballot for addressing other organization

239
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,980
it can be a valuable tool for

240
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,779
identifying the relating potential parts

241
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,560
and develop an effective response Plans

242
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,360
by conducting business impact analysis

243
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,180
uh regularly enroll in stakeholders the

244
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,160
organization can increase the

245
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,040
preparedness and resilience in the face

246
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,640
of unexpected events also including

247
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,160
human psychological concept which is a

248
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,440
recommendation of my friend who is

249
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,540
performing PhD in Psychology and the

250
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,819
research will be religious soon I think

251
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,579
determining uh recovery time objectives

252
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,079
and for the test and purpose is a key

253
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,940
and increase the effectiveness of

254
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,339
business continuity management as well

255
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,019
as business impact analysis which is

256
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,420
part of the business management

257
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,340
thank you for your attention

258
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,220
[Applause]

259
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,140
Wellman thank you so much does anybody

260
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,339
have any question

261
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,640
I personally know that you made it like

262
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,360
seem quite easy but like in practice it

263
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,640
works completely different it's much

264
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,800
more like lengthy process as I've been

265
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,180
described it involves a lot of parties

266
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,220
and that process of identifying and

267
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,800
assessing and prioritizing all these

268
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,260
like potential threats among like

269
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,959
different departments it doesn't go that

270
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,720
smooth you know each department

271
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,640
think or that they have their own

272
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,920
priorities and they want to bump like

273
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,980
the priority level so in case of a

274
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,459
crisis their services or systems or

275
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,019
address first

276
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:48,240
so that's why we have Armand and other

277
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,940
people who likely can walk us through

278
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,380
and help us with those type of

279
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,519
situations

280
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,700
thanks Armin do we have any question

281
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,600
yes

282
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,560
thank you for presentation maybe you can

283
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,959
share with us if it is not confidential

284
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,560
from your bank because uh

285
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,519
data storage having second redundancy of

286
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,820
your servers Etc one side takes some

287
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,160
money cost Etc but when necessary is

288
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,160
very important how often do you make

289
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,860
secure backups and how often you make

290
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,060
Roll-Ups just to be to check that your

291
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,260
Secure Storage is are okay and intact

292
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,519
yeah uh of a backup in data center uh

293
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,480
goes on a real-time application however

294
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,880
we perform another uh backup on tips

295
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,360
which is uh daily and sent to another

296
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,220
location which is different from our

297
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,120
main Data Center

298
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,579
uh

299
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:59,220
what's the length of time that you keep

300
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,660
the the tape so now or the the I don't

301
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,399
know the last seven years the last 10

302
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,139
years what's the the time that you

303
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,880
usually keep the tips

304
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,519
as I have seen from my audits on the IT

305
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,940
department uh they had had tapes as I

306
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,139
remember from 2013. Maybe I'm Wrong I I

307
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,079
don't know exactly but uh probably I've

308
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,079
seen the latest 2013 I don't know if

309
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,200
they have earlier versions of backups

310
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,480
and another thing I I was always curious

311
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,560
how much time does retrieving data from

312
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,279
tips uh take you so let's say you had a

313
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,800
ransomware everything is wiped even the

314
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,839
backup the real-time backup you have to

315
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,440
retrieve everything from the tapes is is

316
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,380
it I don't know a lengthy process to

317
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,240
retrieve everything from the tapes or

318
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,519
does is it done you know where is yeah

319
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,240
uh since we have a lot of data a huge

320
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,060
database in our institution uh on last

321
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,600
performance of recovering from tapes

322
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,519
especially on the case simulated case

323
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,480
that uh we had on server attack it took

324
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,600
about two days to fully recover from the

325
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,000
tapes

326
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,779
thank you you're welcome

327
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,440
I guess the backup strategy it's like a

328
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,560
science on its own I know that not only

329
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,920
like backups that we do as Army knows

330
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,680
like as scheduled but we also have like

331
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,959
real-time replication then you want to

332
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,880
make sure that you have like even the

333
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,440
backup for media for example for

334
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,540
companies that uh I used to work before

335
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,079
we didn't only have like vpns we also

336
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,660
had like a fiber cable going from asq to

337
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,779
DRC and then maybe just to to add to

338
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,060
what Armand said

339
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,519
um regarding the data backup like how

340
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,620
fast usually if you want it to be

341
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,199
restored fast it takes long time to back

342
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,360
up so it's like always you're gonna

343
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,639
either make that extra mile while you're

344
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,160
backing up or if you want to do it fast

345
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,079
you're going to do the same like path

346
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,579
when you're restoring it

347
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,819
any other question

348
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,019
yes you know

349
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,459
um

350
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,620
first of all thank you very much for

351
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,480
your presentation

352
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,060
um I wanted to ask you maybe from your

353
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,860
point of experience you've been an

354
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,800
auditor and there's some correlation

355
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,820
between the recovery in time and

356
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,480
Recovery point so retail RTO and RPO RPO

357
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,920
yes

358
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,860
um on your experience up until now what

359
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,540
do you think should be let's say the

360
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,360
time difference between the two

361
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,079
or it depends on the industry

362
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,740
it's uh not written standard to to have

363
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,920
that difference but we have to to have

364
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,400
in mind that uh RPO have to be always

365
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,599
shorter than RTO so uh we have a point

366
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,179
object where we have to go and we have

367
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,000
the time how to go uh how much it takes

368
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,819
to go to that object so uh during my

369
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,059
experience I have seen uh that we had

370
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,699
cases that have they have a institution

371
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,839
planned to have rpos uh longer than rtos

372
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,200
which is contrary uh we have to have uh

373
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,660
have a or shorter rpos uh longer rtos uh

374
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,539
but it uh I don't remember if uh there

375
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,000
is a standard that defines this uh

376
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,120
difference on time between those two uh

377
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,000
objects okay thank you you're welcome

378
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,020
do we have more questions foreign

379
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,600
okay Armin thanks so much that was very

380
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,559
insightful you're welcome
