1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,520
good luck thank you thank you everyone

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,519
for being here it's great to be here I

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,380
want to thank dardan and the team for

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,080
organizing besides we now we know how

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,020
much effort is needed so well done it's

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,020
looking great so today I'm going to

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,600
speak about using common attack database

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,480
and intent clustering to protect

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
websites mobile apps and apis

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,079
okay

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,860
apparently this doesn't like me

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,960
yeah I'll just use this thank you so

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,579
first I want to give an into drug

14
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,700
introduction of who I am so

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,219
um my current job is a lead data analyst

16
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,920
at netacia a manchester-based company

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,920
where I work closely with threat

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,739
research team and data science team to

19
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,140
identify and protect protect web

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,000
services and API from the recent threat

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,119
attacks basically I'm also a co-founder

22
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,659
and organizer at besides srirana we have

23
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,060
called for papers open it's the second

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,820
edition that we are running this year if

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,979
you want you can have a look and submit

26
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,900
your talk if you are looking for any

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,600
instructions either myself or Rio we are

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,080
happy to support and give our feedback

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,880
I'm also an organizer and team at

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,759
illyrian brains so illyrian brains is a

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,479
community-based organization the focus

32
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,759
is to bring together all Albanian

33
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,860
professionals

34
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,619
worldwide do meetups webinars and have

35
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:44,880
fun together

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,460
so I'm interested in threat hunting both

37
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,920
cyber security threat analytics and

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,680
threat protections

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,420
my name is Paulina chakali you can also

40
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,460
find me in social media in LinkedIn

41
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,419
Twitter or GitHub

42
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
so sorry

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,799
[Music]

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,840
so the agenda for today will be what

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,000
automated threads are we facing today

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,879
kill chain investigation mapping mapping

47
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,220
attacks to Blade framework uh threat

48
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,800
attack sophistication level what is cut

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,800
common attack database clustering method

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,459
used to identify malicious traffic

51
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,099
analyzing bad bot behaviors and also

52
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,260
using machine learning to identify Bots

53
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,220
by passing captures

54
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,819
so first let's start with the automated

55
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,459
dress like the most recent automated

56
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,680
threads that we see in my day-to-day job

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,900
are like credential Staffing account

58
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,200
takeover fake account creation scalper

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,959
and sneaker Bots web scraping gift card

60
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,720
abuse and also there are so many others

61
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,760
automated threads that we are facing

62
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,160
nowadays that are causing like either

63
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Financial damage or reputational damage

64
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,500
to the businesses

65
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,620
so I wanted to give us an introduction

66
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,900
about blade framework so blade framework

67
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,019
is similar to maitre framework so I

68
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm pretty sure that everyone here knows

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,420
about the faces tactics and techniques

70
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,239
of the maitre framework so creative

71
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,060
knowledge base of adversary tactics and

72
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,500
techniques based on real-world

73
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,840
observations of business logic attacks

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,140
there are six phases disting stages that

75
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,940
a business logic attack May progress

76
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,700
through there are 24 tactics the

77
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,040
Strategies employed by adversaries

78
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,200
during specific phases and also 80

79
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,659
techniques the specific actions or

80
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,519
methods performed to achieve tactical

81
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,599
goals

82
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,840
and then we will explain

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,180
um and map attacks to Blade framework

84
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,099
we'll start with the credential Staffing

85
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,959
kill chain overview

86
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,540
so what is the credential Staffing bot a

87
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,700
credential Staffing bot is used to test

88
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,040
previously leaked credentials typically

89
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,319
usernames and password pairs that you

90
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,500
can either Buy in in dark web to

91
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,299
determine if they are valid on a Target

92
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,299
web service or API these spots validate

93
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,340
credentials payers against their target

94
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,579
web service or apis by automating login

95
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,279
attempts allowing adversaries to test

96
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,740
and validate credentials at Mass scales

97
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,660
so when we talk about credential

98
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,780
Staffing Bots the end points will be

99
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,020
login endpoints that adversaries

100
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,479
basically will try to attack

101
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,120
in the credential Staffing bot the blade

102
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,820
framework has like six phases the first

103
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,400
phase is resource development where

104
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,800
basically the attacker will

105
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,340
um

106
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,440
produce the tools that they need to

107
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,699
attack and then we have the

108
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,639
reconnaissance stage where basically

109
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,500
um the attacker will know what is the

110
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,780
specific Target which in this case as I

111
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,180
said before it's login endpoints and

112
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,720
then defense bypass attack execution

113
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,880
actions on the objectives and post

114
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,020
attack so we I mean this kind of attack

115
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,780
is the most seen attack recently also

116
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,940
the scalper button sneaker boss I mean

117
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,320
I'm pretty sure you might have heard

118
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,080
about the PS5 launch when we had this

119
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,720
you know crazy stuff going with the ps5s

120
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,780
but also recently in the Eurovision song

121
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,660
contests like the tickets went at around

122
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,139
one uh sorry 11 000 pounds because of

123
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,479
bots doing this you know scalping all

124
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,099
the tickets and like reselling them

125
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,960
also I wanted to give some information

126
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,300
about the fake account creation bot fake

127
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,160
account creation Bots abuse the sign up

128
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,919
process of a web service to create user

129
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,020
accounts in bulk using stolen or fake

130
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,840
identities so yeah mostly on the fake

131
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,639
account creation attacks they target

132
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,180
register endpoints these Bots automate

133
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,400
multiple sign up requests which can be

134
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,280
spread out over long periods of time of

135
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,520
using IP addresses from different

136
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,780
geolocations to hide the fact that they

137
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,419
are controlled by by one person I mean

138
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,100
the resident the attacks coming from

139
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,199
residential proxy networks might be a

140
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,500
good example of this kind of attacks

141
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,320
coming from fake account creation Bots

142
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,539
many Advanced fake account creation Bots

143
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,539
can also bypass email phone and captcha

144
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,840
verifications uh mapping to the blade

145
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,759
framework here we see five phases they

146
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,319
are pretty much the same phases so I'm

147
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,860
not going to mention the same one so I'm

148
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,780
moving to the next attack which is

149
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,960
creeper board and scalping this is the

150
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,720
same group of um no sorry this is

151
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,419
scraperbot webscaping is the use of both

152
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,759
together content of data from websites

153
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,479
they can scrape product

154
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:50,580
endpoints the prices of the products it

155
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,199
might be a competitor who is trying

156
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,840
basically to scrape all your website and

157
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,120
like to clone it and create the same

158
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,460
website on or they can play with the

159
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,259
prices like if you have if you are

160
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,120
selling the same products they can

161
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,100
manipulate the prices and make more

162
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,520
business than you again this goes over

163
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,500
six phases resource development

164
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,539
reconnaissance defense bypass attack

165
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,660
execution actions and objectives and

166
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,479
post attacks and the last one I wanted

167
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,180
to talk today is calpurn sneakerbot

168
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,819
group breaking the kill chain with blade

169
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,860
so here we have it's interesting because

170
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,020
some of the use cases that we mentioned

171
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,539
before are part of this uh attack

172
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,940
basically so the first phase of the

173
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,400
scalp robot is monitoring targeted

174
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,039
websites creating accounts and scraping

175
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,080
products so fake account creation

176
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,900
credential Staffing account takeover and

177
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,819
product scraping up are part of the

178
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,919
phase one of this attack

179
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,220
and then like if I'm an attacker I'll

180
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,020
scrape your products I'll create either

181
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,500
fake accounts or compromise like

182
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,819
existing accounts to do some product

183
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,160
scraping and then what I'll do I'll let

184
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,979
all the stuff into the basket or add to

185
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,680
cartoons where Bots hit the basket

186
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,620
massively they simulate many users and

187
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,800
we have Speedy scripted Bots from my

188
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,240
experience we have seen that these

189
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,620
attacks last for seconds or minutes in

190
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,660
web services or API so they are very

191
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,000
fast that's why they use speed descript

192
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,580
Bots and the last phase is check out

193
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,000
abuse Bots hit checkout endpoints in

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,580
this the the last phase that they do

195
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,800
credit card and gift card fraud as well

196
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,020
so the reason why they do this is

197
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,080
because they want to gain discounts

198
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,179
basically and um

199
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,219
spend less money and then they do

200
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,559
multiple purchases exceeding limits out

201
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,020
of stock and this is mostly used for

202
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,200
limited edition products like Adidas gz

203
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,740
or Nike shoes or the PS5 or any other

204
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,320
product that is limited edition

205
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,180
basically

206
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,240
so one important

207
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,660
step on analyzing automatic threads is a

208
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,899
sophistication level

209
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:08,580
there are four levels this is how I see

210
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,580
in my day-to-day job the first one is

211
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,800
the easy level where we have an attack

212
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,160
coming from high volume of requests and

213
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,860
they it's like a combination of all

214
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,140
categories like one single user one

215
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,959
single IP one single user agent one

216
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,660
single Data Center and Country so if we

217
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,459
have a high volume of requests coming

218
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,860
from this combination of these

219
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,019
categories is very easy to spot us

220
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,540
basically we can see a peak in the high

221
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,180
number of requests and like

222
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,920
mathematically we can analyze that

223
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,440
quickly I like identify that attack

224
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,959
and then the second phase is moderate

225
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,300
level high volume of requests coming

226
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,019
from multiple users and clients but we

227
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,540
have unique user agents data centers and

228
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,980
countries

229
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,080
um so in this case it's it's still

230
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,420
manageable I would say like you can

231
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,399
build a system with rules and like you

232
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,160
can still identify these taxes it's easy

233
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,140
and then we move in the more

234
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,640
sophisticated levels which is

235
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,500
sophisticated level high volume of

236
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,660
requests coming from multiple users

237
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,660
clients user agents data centers But

238
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,120
Country still in this case I would say

239
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,640
that it's manageable I mean we can

240
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,820
easily mitigate these attacks as we can

241
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,459
do geo blocking for example I mean you

242
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,220
can do in the mitigation strategy you

243
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,680
can block in a user ID IP user agent

244
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,620
data center country or ASN or

245
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,080
geographically so these are still

246
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,240
manageable and then we go in the very

247
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,120
sophisticated level of the tax uh we we

248
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,980
see high number of requests dating

249
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,040
sources we see multiple categories doing

250
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,920
this so these are mostly residential

251
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,860
proxy Network sources so what Bots do

252
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,320
they compromise residential proxy

253
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,680
networks and they behave let's say very

254
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,899
similar with a human and that's the most

255
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,420
challenging level of the attack that we

256
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,899
see and we protect web services or apis

257
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,899
I'll explain later how we do and how we

258
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,380
ensure the protection

259
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,019
so one of the stuff that we use which

260
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,880
basically mitigates in the first

261
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,980
requires and it doesn't need a big

262
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,220
science behind that is cut so cut is

263
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,360
common attack database it involves some

264
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,399
lists one of the lists that we have

265
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,380
created is called capture recommended

266
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,560
thread lists and this basically is using

267
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,200
all the experience like we serve let's

268
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,720
say a part of the traffic to capture

269
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,820
services and then we can see if

270
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,120
something is showing a human behavior or

271
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,640
about behavior and then what we do we

272
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,459
aggregate the data and we collect all

273
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,740
users that haven't been able to pass

274
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,339
captcha at 100 percent and then this is

275
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:57,839
called the capture recommended threat

276
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,300
list and it's part of the card the next

277
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,120
one is residential proxy IPS so we do

278
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,160
this geographically like we collect all

279
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,500
the residential proxy networks let's say

280
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,260
if we are in kosova we will we will

281
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,660
collect all the lists for Kosovo if we

282
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,480
do business with United Kingdom we'll

283
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,519
collect the list with United Kingdom so

284
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,980
basically we we collect geographically

285
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,380
and then we have worst offenders and

286
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,140
these are basically values or entities

287
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,260
that have been collected through a

288
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,120
system of rows like we can use a system

289
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,459
of rules let's say like okay I can build

290
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,640
the regex and I can spot like spooked

291
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,459
user agents for example or

292
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,000
um

293
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,060
or I can build another rule that can see

294
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,660
if an IP is coming through a VPN or like

295
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,120
a private service so there these are

296
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,040
like you know a system of rules that we

297
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,839
build and that we classify if something

298
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,320
is malicious or spoofed and not

299
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,200
representing uh human behavior and also

300
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,120
there are some other lists so these

301
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,760
lists are coming from the models output

302
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,880
basically so why we use cards as I said

303
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,639
before like you can mitigate in the

304
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,339
first request you need zero second of

305
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,100
preparation really like if you want

306
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,560
protection in a web service or API we

307
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
say Okay a model needs time to tune to

308
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,320
validate to do the performance measure

309
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,720
and all this so here is the list we have

310
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,060
and we can protect your website straight

311
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,200
away

312
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,380
and then uh I'll move in the

313
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,440
Plastering method which is the most

314
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,660
challenging part in the detection I

315
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,779
would say there is a lot of mathematics

316
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,240
behind the let's say machine learning

317
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,139
models that are used to identify bots so

318
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,779
first of all this is a classification

319
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,360
problem so basically we need to identify

320
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,740
if a user is a human or a bot being a

321
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,200
classification problem one of the most

322
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,600
common methods that we use is a

323
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
clustering method called dbiscan which

324
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,019
is a density based clustering method

325
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,380
there are some hyper parameters of on

326
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,959
the methods so first we do data set

327
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,779
loading aggregation we aggregate the

328
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,639
data so each row represents a

329
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,800
categorical value and has a Time series

330
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,839
array for that category

331
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,540
and then we have the filtering filter

332
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,519
out categories with a smaller

333
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,100
presentation in the data and reduce the

334
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,380
volume of data to be considered and here

335
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,139
for example when we speak about outliers

336
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,079
this method is really good because it

337
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,660
removes the outliers so they are not

338
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,360
included in the Clusters and this makes

339
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,760
it very efficient for the problem that

340
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,339
we have a noise adjustment all time

341
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,980
series container roughly roughly fixed

342
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,500
amount of noise which interferes with

343
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,839
the distance metric due to scaling so

344
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,120
for the distance metric we use we

345
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,279
usually like by default it's euclidean

346
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,600
distance but you can explore the method

347
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,220
itself

348
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,500
and the clustering algorithm is DB scan

349
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,199
a density-based clustering method

350
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,519
basically and then we move in the

351
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,100
reporting phase where where we have like

352
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,399
a list of cluster labeled and then we do

353
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,579
some uh we set some rules and then we

354
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,220
select we do a cluster selection and

355
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,199
then and then those clusters are used

356
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,420
basically as recommendations for web

357
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,000
services or apis so if you want to

358
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,480
explore with um DB scan clustering

359
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,820
method you can go in the scikit-learn

360
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,100
library and you can play around with the

361
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,079
hyper parameters you can play with the

362
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,260
Epsilon minimum sample of the data and

363
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,459
you can see what's the impact basically

364
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:49,440
so the next one as I said is cluster

365
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,000
overview so what the time series

366
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,639
clustering method will do is it will

367
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,519
identify entities that have the same

368
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,040
behaviors over time so let's say if I'm

369
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,199
a human and I want to buy I don't know a

370
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,500
dress today I'll go home dress red and

371
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,720
then check child payment and that's it

372
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,639
if you are a bot you will do a different

373
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,480
Behavior the probability of myself doing

374
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,820
the same behavior with someone else here

375
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,420
at the same time it's I'll say very

376
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,360
close to zero as it's very rare that all

377
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,980
the people do the same behavior let's

378
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,440
say within the same time period

379
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,440
um so what the method does it it

380
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,360
correlates so basically it correlates

381
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,180
together based on the traffic pattern so

382
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,760
if basically you have automated some

383
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,740
Bots either coming from residential

384
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,060
proxy networks this will be identified

385
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,759
from the behavior basically over time

386
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,220
so we have cluster labeled in this case

387
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,220
we have a lot of clusters like 26 it's a

388
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,980
lot the minus one cluster usually is

389
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,980
unclassified data so usually we're

390
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,740
expecting this to be uh entities of the

391
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,079
data that haven't been able to classify

392
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,779
or correlate together from the pattern

393
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,720
in the trend so this is interesting I

394
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,939
mean usually it's recommended not to use

395
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,619
this cluster but it's interesting

396
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,079
because sometimes you can find out that

397
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,419
there are some unique Bots within this

398
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,919
cluster and then the other clusters

399
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:21,839
so then you build like a system of rules

400
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,359
in terms of selecting clusters as it

401
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,480
might be let's say traffic coming from

402
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,400
semi-trusted data centers that you don't

403
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,620
want to block this kind of traffic as

404
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,020
it's risky it might cause false

405
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,500
positives this is a good method for uh

406
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,500
captcha as a mitigation strategies but

407
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,140
if we are in hard blocking for instance

408
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,440
for us mobile traffic it might be

409
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,660
challenging and we need to set up some

410
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,120
extra rules to make sure that this will

411
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,700
be valid

412
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,320
and then we will see

413
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,840
um analyzing behaviors so here are some

414
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
of the Clusters what is good about this

415
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,299
method is that you can run that intent

416
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,640
let's say in a user ID level but you can

417
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,460
also run that in a client level user

418
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,380
agent so basically all the categories

419
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,080
you have either in an ASL level you can

420
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,360
still run it and find like commonalities

421
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,840
through asms for instance so here in the

422
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,059
top left graph you will see the -1

423
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,400
cluster so hopefully you can see the

424
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,799
automated behavior on the blue line and

425
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,960
then the orange and red one so usually

426
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,539
this is unclassified but still it's good

427
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,840
evidence of finding out some weird

428
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,940
behavior and then you can see the other

429
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,940
clusters that you know like the values

430
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,580
correlate really good over time so let's

431
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,120
say in the top right one you will see

432
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,240
that there are how many lines like five

433
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,059
lines or more but they have all the same

434
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,720
basically Behavior over time so when the

435
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,179
traffic goes down these sources are

436
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,760
doing the same behavior over time and

437
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,900
then we have

438
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,600
um the bottom right graph this is either

439
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,480
more volumetric in terms of the unique

440
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,539
entities that are sending the attack so

441
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,980
here for instance it might be a

442
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,980
residential proxy Network attacks

443
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,120
basically

444
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,160
that is using a very distributed list of

445
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,460
users IPS they use the recent versions

446
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,299
of browsers or and also they use

447
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,700
semi-trusted data centers and this makes

448
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,039
it challenging but still we can find out

449
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,720
on the behavior like which are the

450
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,059
eyepiece or users that are doing this

451
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,500
and to recommend them straight away

452
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,780
so the last topic I wanted to talk today

453
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,140
is bypassing captchas as this is a topic

454
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,799
that it's very challenging nowadays so

455
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,140
all the companies that have bot

456
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,380
management as a strategy as a product

457
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,539
this is one of the parts that we see we

458
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,520
have a lot of discussions with customers

459
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,480
and want to find the goods basically

460
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,760
solving solution

461
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,280
so what happens so low cost human labor

462
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,559
to solve capture images they share the

463
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,799
same cookies to stay active you can pay

464
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,940
them for like very cheap maybe 0.50 to

465
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,360
solve 1000 captcha frames and then what

466
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,400
they do they keep the cookie active and

467
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,320
they can really use the cookie and do

468
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,559
the activity basically

469
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:32,520
and then we have ai chatbot GPT

470
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,380
Etc that can solve captcha with some

471
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,720
human help again but then we also have

472
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
sophisticated Bots that can bypass

473
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,340
capture by using AI to and let's say if

474
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,100
we have a captcha like yesterday when um

475
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,980
dardan was sharing the awards for the

476
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,919
raffle we saw that you know you need to

477
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,500
fill the captcha images you can build an

478
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,840
AI model that will be able to fill that

479
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,940
and bypass the captcha it's very easy

480
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,000
really what we can do is that stop

481
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,340
badbot's user from sharing cookies for

482
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,820
more than x hours like you can add the

483
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,980
rule let's say and say like okay if a

484
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,500
user is using this cookie for more than

485
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,919
12 hours 24 hours then stop it like

486
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,440
expire this cookie and they need to use

487
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,120
a new cookie and this is like a quick

488
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,860
solution it doesn't want a lot of

489
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,679
exploratory data analysis and stuff

490
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,860
uh the other feature that we investigate

491
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,440
is analyze the time that bedbot needs to

492
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,900
bypass capture and compare this to time

493
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,600
needed by humans so this is time to pass

494
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,299
captcha estimation we visualize the

495
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,400
distribution of time needed to bypass

496
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,320
captcha and then we build the captcha

497
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,720
abuse model so basically the features

498
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,580
that I mentioned before like sharing

499
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,159
cookies and also estimating the time to

500
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,159
pass captcha we are able to build like a

501
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,340
captcha abuse model so what we do is uh

502
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,880
we visualize the distribution of humans

503
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,240
and Bots bypassing captures and then we

504
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,539
can see what cluster basically so

505
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,520
usually we'll have two clusters one will

506
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,679
will represent Bots and one will

507
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,840
represent humans and then it's very easy

508
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,179
to spot with some rules which of the

509
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,000
Clusters basically it's uh automated

510
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,320
traffic and then what we do is we we

511
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,480
solve the problem with hard blocking in

512
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,159
these cases

513
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,200
I've also visualized

514
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,140
um so yeah this is bypassing capture so

515
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,419
here I've listed some captcha Farms um

516
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,340
I'm pretty sure there might be others as

517
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,860
well supported captures versions but

518
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,260
most of them basically can be

519
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,080
manipulated and like bypass

520
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,620
um the other one I wanted to share some

521
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,480
information is basically how we

522
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,580
visualize the distribution of bots

523
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,100
bypassing captchas so here are three

524
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,740
different Bots that we're bypassing uh

525
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,539
the captcha and hopefully you can see

526
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,000
how different and unique they are so

527
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,860
basically basically you can see the

528
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,380
purple line and that's a bot that is

529
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,419
more stationary and like

530
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:07,380
um they need up to maybe for 50 seconds

531
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,120
um to bypass and then we have a noise

532
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,080
here of 90 seconds so this Bots it's you

533
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,299
know manipulating us like if we say okay

534
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,400
we can't set the threshold and say like

535
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,280
okay humans need like 40 seconds and

536
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,220
Bots need like I don't know 20 seconds

537
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,400
before they used to need to take like 12

538
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,440
seconds to bypass but now it's

539
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,539
completely the opposite they are

540
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,820
behaving as humans and this makes it

541
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,740
even more challenging and then we have

542
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,440
the red bars so we can see that this bot

543
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,480
is um

544
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,140
is bypassing before 20 seconds and in a

545
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,000
much more number of requests like up to

546
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,840
300 requests and the third

547
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,419
um behavior of both I'll say is

548
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,240
bypassing in around 10 seconds

549
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,559
um sending around 67 requests so yeah as

550
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,780
I said I mean we see different behaviors

551
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,600
really and it's challenging it's a new

552
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,059
industry I'd say but it's definitely

553
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:09,360
interesting this was my talk for today

554
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,460
thank you very much I hope you enjoyed

555
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:11,830
it

556
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:18,000
[Applause]

557
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,659
I don't know why it wasn't working no

558
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:23,280
worries no worries

559
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,559
do we have any question yes we do let me

560
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,158
go out there

561
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,240
thank you very much for the presentation

562
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,580
it was great Insight regarding data

563
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,559
security my only question was uh since

564
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,740
you mentioned the AIS like Chad GPT or

565
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,640
Microsoft Sydney or Google's Bard uh can

566
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,039
we use those like do you see uh

567
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,900
companies or

568
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,140
different solutions using AI as a

569
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,820
protection measure like to counterfeit

570
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,020
these types of bots or uh engines that

571
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,419
want to pass captures or whatever

572
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,179
stuff like that like do you see uh these

573
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:06,080
AI helping us or helping companies in

574
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,700
mitigating data security and web apps

575
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,799
applications and what

576
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,659
um yeah thank you for your question I

577
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,220
mean from my experience I don't think

578
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,080
there is like um

579
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,240
like a chat GTP version or something

580
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,480
else that it's protecting from this kind

581
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,400
of friends it might be in the future who

582
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,679
knows like you know AI is evolving very

583
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,720
quickly

584
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,220
so at the end of the day we're still

585
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,900
building machine learning models to

586
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,059
protect this so if we automate it in an

587
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:35,460
AI level like child gpdl like we say

588
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,320
Okay

589
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,820
identify if this is a bottle user it

590
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,179
will be really good but until now in my

591
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,220
knowledge no

592
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,590
no worries thank you

593
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,299
[Music]

594
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:52,039
do we have any other question

595
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,360
Paulina thank you so much that was very

596
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,979
insightful thank you
