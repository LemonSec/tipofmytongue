minute as you'll notice from the main

00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:29,949
not quite sure that talks about it's a

running theme today where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm quite</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite know what to talk about so</font>

11
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,280
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently in a better I'm not</font>

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,840
doing talk about recitals instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really talking about securing mobile</font>

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,630
apps in your style environments this

18
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,910
doesn't sound<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a floaty boat and</font>

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,880
that's cool it has 13 I won't be

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so what is the problem the problem</font>

22
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,590
is one that software developers

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,809
application developers have seen a lot

24
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the years which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the they spend a</font>

25
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after building applications</font>

26
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,440
putting together than my source code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

27
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,740
then building a binary which they have

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,229
to release for their users DS the

29
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,640
problem is once you put your application

30
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,649
together and distributed it to your

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,630
users they're free to do whatever they

32
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,910
like and free to start putting in the

33
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,949
path there for you to start modifying it

34
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,509
you're distributing it and this is

35
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,580
really what we implying it out of style

36
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:59,530
in line<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean its environment that you</font>

37
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,048
can assume nothing about the only thing

38
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,760
you can release you is that someone will

39
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:09,010
probably at some point writing

40
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:11,560
maliciously analyze your application so

41
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:15,340
the solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution I propose is</font>

42
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,560
to go pardon up which identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 days</font>

43
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:22,750
left in such a way and then whole

and i work with MWR for a couple of

47
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:35,440

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully you're really thinking about</font>

53
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,770
answers to the following questions or

54
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:54,400
maybe have answers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all your questions</font>

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,609
the car stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to scribe</font>

59
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,720
so a quick overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll start off by</font>

60
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,310
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile threats the sort</font>

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,570
state of the mobile malware landscape

62
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,510
then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take an imaginary</font>

63
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:20,350
application and start my way along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

64
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,090
of attack methodology and then I'm going

65
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,460
to take the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same application we're going</font>

66
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to add some hardening measures then when</font>

67
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,060
you go through the same methodology and

68
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,910
then we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how to form an</font>

69
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:36,090
attackers perspective and yeah my

71
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,980
mobile friends and typically when

72
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,590
someone has asked what is the most of

73
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,119
all operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operating</font>

system has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the highest infection rate</font>

75
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:53,020
windows usually pops to mind however

76
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,540
there was a report in 2014 by motive

77
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,250
security of apps that most of the

78

79
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,340
host and they came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some</font>

80
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,320
interesting statistics showing actually

81

<font color="#E5E5E5">android windows the sort of head head</font>

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,030
and were actually took over from windows

84
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,890
and although there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font>

85
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,030
conscious controversy regarding these

cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> proliferate more than people might</font>

89
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:26,720
think so according to kaspersky sixty

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:30,650
percent of malware has financial

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,020
objectives and targeted malware is

92
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:36,409
pretty rare but we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

that's where i miss the fact is gonna

195

get these are the kind of attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

multiplying a client application in

our a preset this this here is a source

down you move along these steps or the

further down at a community down these

219

steps the more risk they're posing to an

they are to complete their objectives

223
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:08,769
and ultimately steal one<font color="#CCCCCC"> group's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aliza</font>

where they identify some<font color="#CCCCCC"> boy in route to</font>

campaign gets downloaded exploitable a

first two steps are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar to the</font>

235
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,569
previous steps they were all

00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:42,850
reconnaissance and weaponization against

237
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:44,738
the mobile client where instead of

238
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,499
identifying vulnerability is this time

239
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:49,149
we're now looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify where some</font>

00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:51,759
security controllers in place and

241
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,589
weaponization were then disabling a

242
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,740
security control to facilitate further

243
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:57,999
attacks against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server once you've</font>

244
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,889
gone through those first two steps

245
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:01,509
you're been free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move into a</font>

bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all the really good stuff is</font>

253
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:21,339
and as I'm sure you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the first two</font>

254
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,170
steps are exactly the same we can slow

00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:27,669
down or stop attacks in this stage we

256
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:29,439
stand to gain in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> versity steps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">who you actually and which I'm we go</font>

259
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:40,030
through mode so let's consider

260
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,560
application and interview all ends of

261
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,589
your pace and marginal application does

262
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,780
exist but it allows users to pay for

263
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,000
online purchases subscriptions transfer

264
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,990

it has two factor authentication we

267
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,720
enforce a good password policy there's

268
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,110
various custom encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of us</font>

269
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,000
so and it's obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> has as a server</font>

270
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:09,370
counterpart overall it's a pretty secure

271
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,540
application or going to do now is go

272
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,670
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> those precautions of</font>

273
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,280
optimization steps in our heads and just

274
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,719
see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I attack affairs at the bottom</font>

275
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,110
of each of these sections I've got a

276
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,600
perceived effort by an attacker this is

277
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">really just or drawing experience it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to play so we're stuck in</font>

279
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,680
reverse engineering this is where we

280
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,589
take the application binary and we try

281
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">and get it back into some form of human</font>

282
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:38,890
readable code in the case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android is</font>

283
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:41,020
written in java this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy and it</font>

284
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,030
is possible to take an application and

285
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,800
get back to somewhere near the source

286
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,560
code that was used to originally build

287
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,969
the app in something like I office is a

288
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,640
definite little harder because we will

289
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">be analyzing machine code however a lot</font>

290
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,240
of attackers are quite familiar with

291
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,560
analyzing this machine code and

292
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,059
obviously very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool for visualizing</font>

293
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,768
it and so

294
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:06,259
doesn't stop attackers from conducting

this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something a lot of factors are</font>

00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:16,519
very familiar with as I'm sure already

299
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:19,639
know so now reverse engineer the

00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,739
application maybe we have identified by

301
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,599
some security controls are in place on

to do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more bad stuff I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:34,399
to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll probably be in high</font>

307
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:35,959
privileges on the device so what we're

308
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,779
going to do as an attacker I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

309
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:41,959
take my device and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run a</font>

310
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:44,629
regrettably the exploits are usually

311
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:46,959
freely available on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet they're</font>

312
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:48,949
usually pretty easy to use point click

313
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,569
to the point where there are lots of

314
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:53,269
non-technical mobile users out there

315
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:55,939
that are using their phones it's really

316
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:58,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite simple for this reason I give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

enough of one out of five right<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

now as reef resort we're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> enroute</font>

debugging the application this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where</font>

322
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:14,149
we can sort analyze the application at

323
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:16,879
long time we can see some of the

324
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,229
sensitive routines as they run maybe

325
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,839

talking about before we can see

comparisons that happening inside the

00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:26,689

332
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:36,509
see some colors

into the sort recognization sections

we're now saw the skull would wear some

security control is in place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we want</font>

341
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,120
to start modifying applications insanely

342
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,620
so that we have application that does

343
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,649
what we wanted to do to start tacking

344
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,379
the server in order to do that we might

345
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:12,149
hook the application it says where we

346
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:15,060
alter the program flow of the

347
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:17,790

348
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:21,300
an example of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sally ssl fitting routine</font>

349
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,459
that says is this certificate legit yes

350
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,920
whoa we can now just replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with yes</font>

351
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:29,219
certificate is legit continue let's not

352
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,170
worry about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore and there are</font>

00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:42,269
involved process than debugging however

356
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:44,759
these tools are very well documented and

357
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:46,500
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> variety of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

particularly easy to do

369
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,320
in order to get it working exactly how

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,830
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get working any application</font>

some decent knowledge of operating

<font color="#E5E5E5">of three</font>

assessing the bits that we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font>

393
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:26,540
about wicked stuff is so let's consider

00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">another application this time we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

some of those hardly measures in place

that I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier we have</font>

398
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:40,040
we're going to vote for me hooked or if

00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:42,200
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make moving talent patch and also</font>

400
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,430
some sort code obfuscation as well let's

go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> reconnaissance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

402

organization just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it before and</font>

403
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:55,160
then we'll see how they compare so the

404
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,660
start of with reverse engineering we do

405
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,610
exactly what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did before we take the</font>

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time none of the function names</font>

411

mean anything the variable thing is

412
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,950
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> confusing all the program flow is</font>

413
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:18,379
heavily altered is really hard to follow

414
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,970
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means is that previously when</font>

415
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,370
it may have only taken us a couple of

416
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">hours to determine exactly where</font>

417
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,179
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

418
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,760
the application it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not take us weeks</font>

419
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,890
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even succeed at all maybe now we</font>

420
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,150
have any idea where these things are but

421
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:36,370
we really don't know how they're being

422
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:37,870
committed in any detail it's definitely

423
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">still possible to gain an understanding</font>

424
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,570
the code because obviously it functions

425
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,310
exactly the same way that it before

426
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:48,129
except now it probably takes hours with

427
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:50,320
pen and paper or working out exactly how

428
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,870
the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is has been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acquired is</font>

429
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,450
a really arduous process it sounds an

430
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,580
effort by an attacker I've given this

431
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,710
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up five the reason for that</font>

432
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,350
being usually if your face could start

433
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,390
of or heavy code obfuscation it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

434
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,889
easier to move on than it is to sit

435
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,690
there trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse engineer on</font>

436
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,240
thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of the implementation</font>

437
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:12,640
effort are introduced in every operating

438
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,740
point oh I've introduced an

439
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,050

582
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:25,810
so we're now on quadric reconnaissance

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,000
and recognization in them what is the

now free to start up sending arbitrary

<font color="#CCCCCC">why would they do that as particularly</font>

our reconnaissance and weaponization

619
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,350
steps it means that attackers can never

620
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,840
get to that position where they can say

all this application is<font color="#CCCCCC"> volatile it may</font>

626

for this reason it particularly

00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:00,520
reverse engineering or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i</font>

729
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,469
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> this or gold standard is to always</font>

730
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,690
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server require some</font>

731
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,420
server authentication or to pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

732
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:09,880
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys you'll see that you can use</font>

733
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:12,420
the information that's exporter is that

734
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,420
possible

735
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:55,320
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you certainly that's</font>

736
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,000
definitely a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea through if you're</font>

737
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,590
implementing these protections there's a

738
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,809
really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea to notify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your server</font>

739
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:03,199
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bypass</font>

740
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:08,070
this someone is<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to attack me</font>

741
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:11,010
therefore even<font color="#CCCCCC"> when be aware however in</font>

742
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,689
terms of letting them then continue with

743
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:14,730
this organ<font color="#E5E5E5"> asus they were conducting I</font>

744
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:19,080
guess it is also beneficial to just poor

745
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:20,850
execution entirely asshole extrem after

746
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,879
communicating the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be ideal</font>

747
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:27,809
approach then was there some stuff like

748
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,669
timing problems that might occur it's

749
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:31,168
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I guess it depends how much</font>

750
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:32,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'll to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know about it compared to how</font>

751
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:36,320
I would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are that they can find out</font>

752
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,320
so I'm secretly don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tonight</font>

753
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,520
yeah I mean there is obviously a small

754
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:33,550
business decision in organization

755
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,560
Saturday because by saying we can't run

756
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:39,010
devices means that they're cutting our

757
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:41,619
party Elizabeth like you say some

758
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,970
institutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> have decided that's a risk</font>

759
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:45,849
that's not worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> someone</font>

760
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:48,459
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually using it and made it a</font>

761
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:50,169
user experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> that decision is really</font>

762
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,929
just for people relative editing

763
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:57,180
applications in terms of the risk

764
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:59,380
exposed during application assessments a

765
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,690
large<font color="#CCCCCC"> percentage of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of attacks</font>

766
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we carry out are usually require me</font>

767
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:06,280
to access<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway so although maybe</font>

768
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,200
running on a rooted device doesn't

769
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,440
necessarily put your immediate risk it

770
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,879
definitely facilitates further attacks

771
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,390
that you previously may not protect

772
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:19,030
against all of these methods are sort of

773
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:21,160
a part of the defense<font color="#E5E5E5"> in depth approach</font>

774
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:24,030
it's just about reducing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk me a</font>

775
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,029
little bit harder

776
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:31,230
you mentioned often<font color="#CCCCCC"> sketch of the code</font>

777
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:33,000
to make article in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> foursome wouldn't</font>

778
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:36,060
that make a part for anyone working in

779
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,290
the program so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was have you</font>

780
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:42,180
been here it would offer skating your

781
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:44,880
application code make harder for people

782
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:48,299
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own organization to work on the</font>

783
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,720
code I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that in most cases</font>

784
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:55,290
no because you applying for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sketching to</font>

785
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:58,709
like compiled libraries<font color="#CCCCCC"> not within the</font>

786
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,029
source code prior to compiling it it has

787
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect that when you tend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

788
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:03,660
decompile<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the deep layers will then</font>

789
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,649
see it it was sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of nonsensical way</font>

790
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,649
rather than

791
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:22,650
that's a lot

792
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,410
you
