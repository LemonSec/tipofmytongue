1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:11,019
one quick announcement before we get

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,430
started liking folks from 415 so if

00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:15,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested you can sign</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up the</font>

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:21,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">reception they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a list and i'll be</font>

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:23,349
going on afterwards so next up on this

6
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:25,329
track we have that<font color="#CCCCCC"> glenn who's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

7
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:28,509
be talking about how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the by</font>

8
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:30,759
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> place and everything and how</font>

9
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:35,590
sharing knowledge convey everything

10
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:39,039
professor yes thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so welcoming</font>

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:42,340
party and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad to see there are so</font>

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,289
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in this talk yeah</font>

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">i should notice i'm in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wiki section</font>

14
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:50,289
so many experienced presenting i will do

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:55,660
my best he where i share<font color="#CCCCCC"> the knowledge</font>

16
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:59,230
and so their security bowl scraper is a

17
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,839
lost project that's being created by me

18
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:05,979
and my brother Ricardo then it couldn't

19
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:09,150
be here today with Lulu and so yeah we

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:12,610
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> this project almost a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year though</font>

21
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:16,390
because yeah we felt that we really

22
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:19,510
needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something about the whole</font>

23
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:23,470
he had missing the missing information

24
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:27,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">and not sharing and we wants to do</font>

25
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:30,280
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it i have also an agenda</font>

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:34,930
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> evernote view what you will see and</font>

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:38,020
go through so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just start why the</font>

28
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:42,400
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows framework so as i said</font>

29
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:45,640
before there was a lot of yeah missing

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,340
security as a design so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,490
developers aren't really aware of all

32
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:56,230
that possible yeah attack vectors that

33
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:58,699
are cable and an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application and well</font>

34
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:01,189
they go to development phase in

35
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,570
get a pen test and in there you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

36
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:07,579
lot of findings they met goes back again

37
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:10,910
fixing them into the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

38
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:19,280
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> curious basically then sort of a</font>

39
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:24,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">layer int 0 / 0 so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just an after</font>

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:27,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">thingy right now and well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

41
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:30,760
should be done by design correctly with

42
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:34,280
the right awareness<font color="#E5E5E5"> great certain</font>

43
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,170
functionality also what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

44
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,440
missing what we really see missing is

45
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:41,899
the defensible coding approach so every

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,390
example you will see on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet if</font>

47
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">you really look hard you can get some</font>

48
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:51,349
good examples but again the defensive

49
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:56,750
coding principle and yeah it's not in

50
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:59,030
there also the security guidance so yeah

51
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,459
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a security requirement</font>

52
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,700
inside your company but then it's yeah

53
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:07,670
basically per person on how to about how

54
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,290
they see it and how they know and you

55
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:14,089
know what type the information they have

56
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:16,819
to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct follow the correct</font>

57
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:21,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">path on how to properly create</font>

58
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:26,500
functional you want so also guidance is

59
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:28,639
sorry hungry guidance also yeah missing

60
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,239
and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I mentioned before</font>

61
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the security requirements a lot of</font>

62
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,690
developing parties don't have to

63
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,400
security requirements so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after they</font>

64
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,069
developed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,920
pressure on releasing and getting to the

66
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:45,230
next project<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah they found out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

67
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,988
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things need to be takes a lot of</font>

68
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,149
time of them are structural issues like

69
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:55,010
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull cyclic as for intelligence or</font>

70
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:57,720
properly escaping user input and yeah

71
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:03,179
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then of course</font>

72
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:05,790
Security's heart you find a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ways</font>

73
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,950
on not how to do it and even the books

74
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,959
and examples you will see to teach you

75
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">how to program will not mention anything</font>

76
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,470
about security and yeah security<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

77
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:19,108
hard we think a security information

78
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:23,220
should be available for everybody I mean

79
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:25,830
this is knowledge that that is needs to

80
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,410
be shared right i<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean you know went to</font>

81
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">the heck about the database and people</font>

82
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,750
committing suicide and about you know

83
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">the information that that got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

84
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:39,620
yeah and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to team up right we</font>

85
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:42,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to do this together and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and</font>

86
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,090
when we doing this and making our

87
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:50,070
applications defensible and yeah really

88
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:52,049
secure so that's basically why i really

89
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,680
started the whole project like all the

90
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,169
said most like a year already and now

91
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,280
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really in a mature phase rebels of</font>

92
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:04,830
all of us has adopted it and yeah

93
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,130
speaking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so the interesting</font>

94
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:12,000
thing I think is what you will get me

95
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:14,700
learn so yeah basically guy to secure

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,830
program so like I said before do

97
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:20,460
security by design and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> implement</font>

98
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:22,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">insecurity afterwards big thing is also</font>

99
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,200
the security awareness it will inform

100
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,020
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> about address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even before you write</font>

101
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,630
a single line of code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is the</font>

102
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,430
specific core functionality inside the

103
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,060
security knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> rumor that I will</font>

104
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:39,390
show you later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so yeah it will create</font>

105
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,430
awareness<font color="#E5E5E5"> one developers yeah to know</font>

106
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:45,570
what is possible when dealing with

107
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:47,520
certain functionality and of course I

108
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,680
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is also very important</font>

109
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,320
one a central place for security

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,240
reference because I also found out that

111
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,820
when I was looking for good code

112
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,270
examples or good explanation of an

113
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,360
attack or mitigation I have to pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

114
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,299
Oval<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

115
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,330
do an assessment of the code found out

116
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,460
of this bad code so it yet again the

117
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,370
looking further it was really a

118
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:17,198
time-consuming thing and the other thing

119
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:19,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">was yeah who makes this user on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

120
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,150
forum somewhere an authority that I

121
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:26,710
should believe in that he said you know

122
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:28,568
the correct thing it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

123
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,609
sores are easy to adjust its just

124
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:33,219
supporting both somewhere on the

125
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,199
internet right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that's why we also</font>

126
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:37,539
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create a central place for all</font>

127
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,419
your security reference in application

128
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:44,080
development and so yeah you don't have

129
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:45,878
to google find in here Gary's the

130
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">content you are looking for in the code</font>

131
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,620
examples everything is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

132
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:53,349
available on github so you have the

133
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is over everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

134
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:58,659
edit modify and contribute and so that's

135
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:03,008
why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really also a good</font>

136
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:08,379
thing but you also will see later on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

137
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:11,680
have two demos today so I hope they will

138
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:13,719
be awesome and yeah again I will point

139
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,449
this stuff also out with and the

140
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:19,509
software development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle of this</font>

141
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:21,729
project itself so security<font color="#CCCCCC"> multimeric</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

142
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:24,819
web application with all content code

143
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:27,159
examples threat analysis checklist for

144
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:30,580
verification all that yes but we also

145
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:33,009
used same principles we tell in the

146
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:36,008
project itself so we have fully

147
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:38,680
automated it like a DevOps way the

148
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:41,740
continuous integration to link you have

149
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:46,180
to keep the quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> and but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will go</font>

150
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:49,169
into depth at later so first I want to

151
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,819
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the stages</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of development and</font>

152
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,859
so in the security knowledge world we

153
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:55,960
have two stages of development we call

154
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,449
them the pre-development face and the

155
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,849
post development phase the free

156
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,830
development phase that is basically when

157
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:04,510
you're in the designing face so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

158
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:08,140
new project or new spray

159
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:10,420
you have you know from that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

160
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">product owner area on this on this type</font>

161
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,190
of functionality and you will define it

162
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,740
in the development phase so in here you

163
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,840
can basically select the different type

164
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,270
of functionality or functionality steps

165
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,390
you want to implement or create in the

166
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,460
new project or<font color="#CCCCCC"> sprint and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

167
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,830
monitoring work will correlate those

168
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,530
type functionality to a knowledge base

169
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,990
item and the mocospace items basically

170
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,970
saying hey this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> description of</font>

171
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,640
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> item and with the description we</font>

172
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:41,979
try to explain what the attacker can do

173
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,860
when a developer is not properly

174
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:48,190
mitigation or mitigating yeah this issue

175
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:50,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">or tech factor so this base is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a</font>

176
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,390
threat analysis system where yeah like I

177
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">said before before you even write a</font>

178
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:59,260
single line of code developer is getting

179
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,570
aware of all the attack vectors and so

180
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:05,020
it can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that into consideration and</font>

181
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:08,860
into a CR project and you know and

182
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:13,270
already take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rhythm and do it as by</font>

183
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:15,040
design and like we want to then when we

184
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,980
have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> face then we have also the</font>

185
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,890
post developer face and basically this

186
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,990
is when you already<font color="#E5E5E5"> created go to it's</font>

187
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,090
sort of a verification step the last

188
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,340
final<font color="#E5E5E5"> check before the developer hands</font>

189
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:32,440
over the code and it goes to do manual

190
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:36,060
fantastic etc and by the checklist we

191
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,470
are using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lobos eyes yes the</font>

192
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,050
disturbed occasion security verification

193
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:45,910
standard it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> project is already</font>

194
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:48,490
dating from 2011 and yes used by

195
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:53,410
military government's financial all kind

196
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:56,260
of interesting organizations and why is

197
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,969
that because it's yeah the name of

198
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">already says itself it's really odd</font>

199
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:03,810
found stuff the security controls in the

200
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:08,279
checklist are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> around 100</font>

201
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:10,260
the 70 items<font color="#CCCCCC"> on different category for</font>

202
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:14,160
the whole step of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> web application</font>

203
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:17,279
and basically they have lived different

204
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,449
levels in it that's what I want to talk

205
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:25,080
now because well you have to level one

206
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:28,050
that's easy no too hard stuff but yeah

207
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:31,440
you need starts somewhere right so the

208
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:34,229
left one is to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> f of 2 and 3</font>

209
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,529
this well this one is basically what i

210
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:40,320
always use because where i work with it

211
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:42,720
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical web applications and so</font>

212
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,540
for us the security requirement in our

213
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,240
company would be everything it would be

214
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,730
build new or improved is going to be

215
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,279
used the ash vs level 3 as a security

216
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:56,910
requirement because that's the really<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

217
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:00,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">depth yeah shield and you know that</font>

218
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:02,579
making your application defendable yeah

219
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:07,350
and also very secure as i will<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you</font>

220
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:10,410
later<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so I now talked a little bit</font>

221
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,180
about a dispute no<font color="#E5E5E5"> tremor the post and</font>

222
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:16,500
free development phase knowledgebase

223
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:19,680
items and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font>

224
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:23,010
the framework itself so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i</font>

225
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,349
want to do is show it and tell about the

226
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:29,430
functionality and afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to</font>

227
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:32,010
give you complete overview of how yeah

228
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:35,010
i'm basically using this in all side all

229
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:37,650
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies to think about my own</font>

230
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,650
company giving you no guidance in

231
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:44,160
helping the developers there is also

232
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:46,500
going to our partners and the parties to

233
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,810
spend the day<font color="#CCCCCC"> there explaining them to</font>

234
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,140
work the security mode framework and how

235
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:54,089
to apply it in their organization and

236
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,580
the security knowledge trailer is really

237
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:59,400
was really intended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be for the</font>

238
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:02,400
developer so it was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> created in the</font>

239
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:06,510
pie table floss micro back surface

240
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:09,650
script language<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that like that so</font>

241
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,150
you can run it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your local machine</font>

242
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:15,660
everything you need is on your load

243
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:18,480
she but we also improving it and making

244
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,819
it yeah like you can install this

245
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,620
surface inside your company with usual

246
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:28,590
roles management stuff like that um so I

247
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:32,040
first want to show you the demo

248
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:34,020
environment so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

249
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,689
security mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> forever as you can see it</font>

250
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:40,199
is just the gap like I said a micro web

251
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,720
surf web application and in here we can

252
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,720
manage and use the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge</font>

253
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,060
Kramer before I go into the free

254
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,970
development phase post developers face I

255
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:53,550
first want to start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the knowledge</font>

256
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">base items and the code examples because</font>

257
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:59,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge base items that's</font>

258
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:02,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">something we yeah heavy depend on and</font>

259
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,100
poor labels in the pre-development face

260
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,840
and then the post develop these days<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

261
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,510
as you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can search through</font>

262
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:14,490
the knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> base items so if you want</font>

263
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:15,930
yeah a specific type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah reference</font>

264
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,540
so you want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I upload</font>

265
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,719
injection<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah what was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it about what</font>

266
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,939
type of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to think about so</font>

267
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,070
basically what you can do is then search

268
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,990
the item in the lowest place and in here

269
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,550
what I said before is trying to explain

270
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,200
the different type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tech factor</font>

271
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">cement take a guess when you're not</font>

272
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,840
dealing with this yeah tech factor we

273
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:42,170
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something for it on the code</font>

274
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:45,360
level and in the solution we then try to

275
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:49,160
yeah like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said guide developer in the</font>

276
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:53,760
right mindset to mitigate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the defense</font>

277
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:56,550
against these type of attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so for</font>

278
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the ash vs items we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a mobile</font>

279
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,170
base article in there and also for all

280
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:03,300
the pre-development technology stack you

281
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:08,670
can choose we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> knowledge base</font>

282
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:11,160
item for it so yeah I school a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

283
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:15,660
bit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can see there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

284
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,819
of yeah items in there like I said let's

285
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,150
do to the ass<font color="#E5E5E5"> us that</font>

286
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:24,000
has 160 years of security control items

287
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:27,060
in there but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those items</font>

288
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,120
you want to apply and implement as a

289
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:34,709
design phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> application from</font>

290
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:38,160
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and to do so we have the</font>

291
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:41,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">premium post in philippines phase and</font>

292
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:45,150
also a thin what you notice i didn't

293
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,250
really describe the attack factor in the

294
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,829
knowledge base items like how an

295
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:53,790
attacker would inject this or use this

296
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:56,490
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to not do that and just to</font>

297
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:59,699
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a generic type of content and</font>

298
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:02,640
text only because like all of us has a

299
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:07,590
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> examples forget</font>

300
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,750
already on the wiki with this and for

301
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,150
the developer like just creating

302
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,700
awareness the possibility he'll be aware

303
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:18,270
like he doesn't know how to that is

304
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:21,060
documented on places know and really

305
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:24,500
reference in one framework where all the

306
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:28,680
knowledge is in that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah nowhere so</font>

307
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:31,770
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we focus on that just bring</font>

308
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,770
your awareness to the developer and give

309
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:37,890
them right mindset to mitigate the

310
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:40,710
attack vectors but like i said before

311
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:43,699
the text<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really generic I mean that's</font>

312
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:47,310
also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

313
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:50,730
paperwork it's just paperwork it's

314
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:53,250
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to use it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again they</font>

315
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:55,530
give you a sense of awareness but you

316
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:58,070
all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when it comes to</font>

317
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:01,680
implementing type of functionality or

318
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:06,150
confusion or an idea you still can have

319
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:09,599
we have big security issues in there so

320
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:13,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why we also decided to go to the</font>

321
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,900
next level in a level deeper right so

322
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,110
what we did is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we created for multiple</font>

323
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,390
code languages

324
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:23,200
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm currently busy building parking</font>

325
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:26,500
examples jim manikan<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> foam</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

326
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:29,890
are building a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java examples we now do</font>

327
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:34,810
at HP and look<font color="#CCCCCC"> net already and we will</font>

328
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:38,260
continue adding new examples because we

329
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:41,079
think yeah this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important</font>

330
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,540
this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing the developer</font>

331
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:46,479
technical level the same language he

332
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:52,029
speaks on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> properly mitigate and</font>

333
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,700
yeah how how to how to handle with it so

334
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:58,660
again if I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> take here for example</font>

335
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:02,170
then the file upload functionality so

336
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,720
any RHP function or in this case

337
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:07,659
applause where we do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file upload</font>

338
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,720
handling and don't know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

339
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,760
familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with PHP but in HP you can do</font>

340
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,860
follow the plot in three four lines of

341
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,220
code and then you can have the

342
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:23,079
functionality and they float your files

343
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:24,730
but as we all know that gives if you do

344
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">that way it gives the attacker the</font>

345
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,320
possibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> to upload his own code</font>

346
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:31,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromised all server and from there go</font>

347
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,409
into your network or whatever he wants

348
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:39,580
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then again look at this code</font>

349
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:41,679
example how we try to really try to do

350
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:46,178
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the steps and explain why we're</font>

351
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:49,450
doing type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know steps so for</font>

352
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:52,390
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we do an input validation</font>

353
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,790
and why you will see this a lot in all

354
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,460
the examples we always do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

355
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:01,629
validation and while we do that because

356
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:04,450
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to verify and also trigger and</font>

357
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:07,600
walk that in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user had an</font>

358
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:12,429
invalid following<font color="#CCCCCC"> its one-year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> medium</font>

359
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a type of tech factor so if does go</font>

360
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:17,710
wrong we were yeah you can easily seen

361
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,250
from the lot of this is interesting

362
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:24,290
critical functionality that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

363
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:27,770
again well we do gather another look

364
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:31,490
redirect and then well if those<font color="#E5E5E5"> post is</font>

365
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:33,379
we go through again we go validating

366
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,860
make sure the Long's extension is

367
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:39,500
preventing so you know the good old

368
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:42,919
double extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> trick so check register</font>

369
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,860
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> GP hey in there oh yeah this is</font>

370
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:49,760
good but yeah when you don't do it HP it

371
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:52,600
will also just go through right and so

372
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,490
again we have different type of

373
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,399
medication for this so in here you see a

374
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:00,470
piece of code that is doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis</font>

375
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,830
and checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the extension and again</font>

376
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:06,170
if it's not correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will work and</font>

377
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:10,790
also well in this case cetera and high

378
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:13,400
as a risk score and in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see also</font>

379
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,740
when this fails then we set a counter in

380
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,390
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if the counter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hits three</font>

381
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,330
the user session must be terminated

382
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">after three sessions terminations the</font>

383
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,139
account should be blocked since the high

384
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,470
threat level will need to immediate

385
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:32,900
termination so basically using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Intel</font>

386
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:35,690
and the thread so low me your mind and

387
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:39,560
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can set higher or lower</font>

388
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:41,300
counters in our in the security

389
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,060
knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kramer in this framework if</font>

390
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:48,139
you try to inject here cosine script in

391
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:51,760
SQL injection after five counters you

392
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:55,430
will kicked<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and account will the</font>

393
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,830
book of course walking out of accounts

394
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:01,040
that can be also left<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our service</font>

395
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:03,139
attack so and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose to implement</font>

396
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,530
them in this way because then it's

397
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:12,410
really visible also people<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to the</font>

398
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:14,180
heck table will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be kicked out so again</font>

399
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,880
what we really try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in the code</font>

400
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,800
examples is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> step for step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

401
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,500
through and why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing this and</font>

402
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,520
now work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

403
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,400
funny one

404
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:29,460
so if you can remember on the header if

405
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,100
you won't do this die then let me

406
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,300
mention here wrestle to HP code is still

407
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:38,760
being executed so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would friends</font>

408
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,399
under these lines power apples from

409
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,930
whatever the attacker can still see

410
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,630
because that because there is going to

411
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:48,690
die after another redirect for example

412
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:51,870
so again we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to for every step</font>

413
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:54,870
taking the developer give it the right

414
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:58,639
guidance to ya how to tackle this attack

415
00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:02,159
vector and you know the code examples

416
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,800
the idea is not to copy paste we

417
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,350
projected we injected the st. artists of

418
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,310
all correct but it's only there for

419
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:14,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">training right to get you right mindset</font>

420
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:16,800
and yeah hopefully you will then do

421
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:20,670
yourself implement and blue security as

422
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:23,610
design well we can also pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> the book</font>

423
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:27,330
net version of uploads and then here you

424
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:29,639
see how we do it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the book next</font>

425
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,760
version again the same principles before

426
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,980
you do in action you love and<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you</font>

427
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,370
love you Frankie date so here's Pierce

428
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:41,520
validating checking if it's passing or

429
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:44,879
not if not pass in your reporting and

430
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,389
looking at after that one you woke it

431
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,120
hey I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this action and</font>

432
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:55,710
after that then you do the action and it

433
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:59,370
sounds really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> God but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I see I saw a</font>

434
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:03,660
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cows and the law cooked analyzing</font>

435
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:05,909
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the thing and I saw a lot</font>

436
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,790
of times happening that they first<font color="#CCCCCC"> uni</font>

437
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,830
action and then they look hey this

438
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:14,070
action has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been done or triggered or</font>

439
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:17,779
whatever but there is already a major

440
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:20,629
flaw in it and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> when an attack</font>

441
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:22,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">has a successful attack vector and an</font>

442
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:26,228
expert that type of functionality and

443
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:29,149
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> log the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> action afterwards yeah then</font>

444
00:22:26,229 --> 00:22:31,340
there is a chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you won't see any</font>

445
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:33,199
evidence of the attack if it was

446
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,879
successful so that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

447
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,509
validate that's what you want to load

448
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:43,248
and that's why yea though mindset the

449
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:46,039
whole approach from how to do this so

450
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:48,919
you have that this basically at the

451
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:51,379
context almost in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the knowledge base the</font>

452
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:53,479
code examples are for reference to go in

453
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:55,998
there to check<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what are the steps I</font>

454
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:58,700
need to take and again the knowledge

455
00:22:55,999 --> 00:23:01,879
base items are is being used in the pre

456
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,429
and post development phase and so that

457
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:07,908
is what i want to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you now is</font>

458
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:12,200
basically so how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> i use this in in</font>

459
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:16,159
well third party Kristen other partners

460
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,759
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would use it this first we</font>

461
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,099
need to define the security requirements

462
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:24,109
because without that you know we cannot

463
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:27,189
blame the developer anything if you

464
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:30,949
don't give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them requirements yeah this</font>

465
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:33,259
makes sense right so first we need to be

466
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:38,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">concerned about what type of security</font>

467
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:42,259
requirements should we apply so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

468
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:44,809
am a<font color="#E5E5E5"> real pro active user of the ice vs</font>

469
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:47,919
the level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 because that's critical for</font>

470
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:53,960
critical applications really go in depth

471
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:56,210
and well basically you yeah you make

472
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,159
that arrangement you say okay you're

473
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:02,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use and apply the level 3 and</font>

474
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,269
when we all agreed upon that then we can

475
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:07,849
continue using the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice river</font>

476
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:11,149
and so in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to create a</font>

477
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:12,859
project and it's just

478
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:17,629
fictional projects or doesn't really

479
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:22,089
matter the name now then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can select</font>

480
00:24:17,629 --> 00:24:24,019
the project min and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said before</font>

481
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:26,389
here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the pre-development</font>

482
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:28,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">finished they add processing functions</font>

483
00:24:26,389 --> 00:24:30,439
in this policy fellow<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

484
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:33,649
already have code so first I'm going

485
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,589
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one they had free</font>

486
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:38,959
development phase so in here you can see

487
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:41,839
a different type of functions you can

488
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">use and yeah are very common in web</font>

489
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:47,359
applications that there are sort of

490
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:50,899
components technology stacks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

491
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:54,139
very yeah much used in applications and

492
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:56,089
so what you can do is you can add new

493
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:58,269
formula so you're in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> designing face</font>

494
00:24:56,089 --> 00:25:04,089
you want to create new functionality and

495
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:09,320
well so in this print we do not do any

496
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:12,469
user display just walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

497
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:16,099
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's well we use case a very</font>

498
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:19,159
common so what we now can do is add

499
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:21,950
function and the add function suppose

500
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,869
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop down menu where we can select</font>

501
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different technologies we're going</font>

502
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:29,149
to use for creating this type of

503
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:31,758
function and so because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to</font>

504
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:33,529
display users and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look in we select</font>

505
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy Mel because yeah we're going to</font>

506
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:40,009
use hot melt display the user's name in

507
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:43,488
there you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do forms and we're</font>

508
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:48,950
gonna do Bob sessions so now you can say

509
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:59,179
add values<font color="#E5E5E5"> game on both run over with me</font>

510
00:25:48,950 --> 00:26:02,059
today oh so I said about validating

511
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:04,279
right and we are very strict and

512
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:07,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">validating so I put a plus in there an</font>

513
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:10,219
application on Ohio so now it's already

514
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:12,019
flagged also the counter one up right

515
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:15,169
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> setting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

516
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:17,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">please keep you Freddy if it has a</font>

517
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:20,329
certain threshold taken action we

518
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:23,899
decided effort like I said six times the

519
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:26,809
whole application drops and is lot of

520
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:28,639
course like intense and if you have a

521
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:35,210
nuclear power plant that would be an

522
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:41,619
issue but yeah so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me redo it so</font>

523
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:46,309
adding the half moon set<font color="#E5E5E5"> forms sessions</font>

524
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:48,889
and so you get a function submarine as

525
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:51,229
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see function technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok all</font>

526
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:53,629
done this is about what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> deserve</font>

527
00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:56,389
decided on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> functionality</font>

528
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:59,359
want that and now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security framework</font>

529
00:26:56,389 --> 00:27:03,589
has correlated those type of technology

530
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:05,449
stacks yeah true<font color="#CCCCCC"> knowledge base item so</font>

531
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:07,219
it hooks them up and correlate sort of

532
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,919
the threat analysis and making the

533
00:27:07,219 --> 00:27:12,169
developer and already aware of yeah

534
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,469
holder the danger zone and that are

535
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:16,999
lurking around the corner and as you can

536
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:19,519
see for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example when you are dealing</font>

537
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:22,609
with sessions<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's not just only</font>

538
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:25,729
one thing you can do there is basically

539
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:28,999
the whole design<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern you need to</font>

540
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:32,539
implement and again if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do one</font>

541
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:35,529
the whole session management layer is

542
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:39,349
broken it can be defeated by<font color="#E5E5E5"> it by my</font>

543
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:41,869
attackers so if you forget the hot spell

544
00:27:39,349 --> 00:27:43,939
if you like or the superior flag yeah it

545
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:48,139
still is an attacker able to sniff it

546
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:50,509
still it settled himself so again it's

547
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:53,089
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case it is a pattern that is</font>

548
00:27:50,509 --> 00:27:55,339
yeah making developer aware of all the

549
00:27:53,089 --> 00:28:00,240
work and things that he needs to think

550
00:27:55,339 --> 00:28:05,159
of well again for the submitting of<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

551
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,980
it is after<font color="#CCCCCC"> all it is the best practice</font>

552
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hey the first engineers you</font>

553
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,840
have the single user input validation

554
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,600
controls and<font color="#E5E5E5"> audibles in central place</font>

555
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:18,209
then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> costs are depressed</font>

556
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,980
for three tokens that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the thing if</font>

557
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,170
you don't added in beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

558
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,200
the structural issue you take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

559
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:28,530
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement it later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also there</font>

560
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:35,400
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem that it's really easy to</font>

561
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:38,490
forget one form so again yeah it should

562
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:41,160
be part of the design right principal

563
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:44,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">this privilege and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the gas /</font>

564
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,770
post<font color="#E5E5E5"> address think about which one you</font>

565
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:48,600
will use because if you're using again

566
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:50,220
you submitting a password field or

567
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,709
whatever you are you losing all that

568
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,050
information in the browser history in a

569
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,660
defender and all the third party

570
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:00,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">application that you hook in like Google</font>

571
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">and all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript stuff they all</font>

572
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,390
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in</font>

573
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:09,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">together so even the difference between</font>

574
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:12,720
Austin get is important and again yeah

575
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:15,899
we tried really<font color="#E5E5E5"> to guide the developer</font>

576
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,590
in the right mindset to ya make the

577
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:23,010
application really defensible and again

578
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:25,470
for happy now a lot of problems can

579
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:28,440
occur with that content<font color="#E5E5E5"> spoofing image</font>

580
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:31,070
package action<font color="#E5E5E5"> base-jumping element all</font>

581
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:37,140
right hand text areas there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so many</font>

582
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:38,490
cause of an attacker can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go so like I</font>

583
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">said before this is the the</font>

584
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:43,890
pre-development face so now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

585
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,309
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> a developer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can click together</font>

586
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,900
and have already know the awareness like

587
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:51,690
hey think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this think about that</font>

588
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,670
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course if you ask yes as a</font>

589
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:57,600
security requirement you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

590
00:29:53,670 --> 00:30:00,090
good starting point<font color="#E5E5E5"> but of course like i</font>

591
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,240
said before implementing that can also

592
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:07,780
be tricky there are

593
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,990
the security controls in there so if you

594
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:13,960
would also<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on a monday morning LEM go</font>

595
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:16,809
fix those 100 consecutive hotels in your

596
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,630
application I will probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> forget like</font>

597
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:24,610
10 or 20 or maybe 30 because I proved

598
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:26,770
too too much so that's why I will also

599
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:31,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do a verification this is not</font>

600
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:33,550
enough this only awareness training the

601
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,159
idea is when you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it more often that</font>

602
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:39,370
you basically can skip the pretty little

603
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:41,230
face in all everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> policy</font>

604
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,928
development phase here the verification

605
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:48,450
step where you go through i<font color="#CCCCCC"> will show</font>

606
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:51,630
you right now so when we have this

607
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:54,929
developers have the document and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

608
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:57,160
didn't show you that with all the

609
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:59,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">information and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the correlation of the</font>

610
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,170
items can also be downloaded some dog x

611
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:04,840
document that you can send to other

612
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:08,740
colleagues or management or whatever you

613
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:13,120
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have for them here what items were</font>

614
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:15,550
applicable or not and so like I said

615
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is pre-developed finish you didn't</font>

616
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:20,500
write the line of code yet now we're in

617
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">the post defendant face you write your</font>

618
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:26,920
code it went<font color="#CCCCCC"> through your build street</font>

619
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:29,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">it passed everything so basically you're</font>

620
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,840
almost ready to deliver it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next</font>

621
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">person that you live for your project</font>

622
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,790
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> before we do you want to do a</font>

623
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:39,610
verification<font color="#E5E5E5"> a verification if we have</font>

624
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:44,770
all the security protocols in place and

625
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:47,199
we applied all the Ashley s levels as

626
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:49,809
you can see here there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> low</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of top</font>

627
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,960
10 list in here but yeah I call a

628
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:57,428
technical debt and I also want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

629
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,400
clear something almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> pooped</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> n is not a</font>

630
00:31:57,429 --> 00:32:01,340
secure

631
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:04,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people call it the security</font>

632
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:07,639
department I should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> taught and teach</font>

633
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:11,720
like no eyes yes that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font>

634
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:13,340
requirement the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 is not so I want</font>

635
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,920
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference really clear</font>

636
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,530
because I see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little in the security</font>

637
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:21,230
industry they calling this a security

638
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:23,960
standard and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that isn't the ass yes</font>

639
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:26,870
that's the security standard like I said

640
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">before we have different levels what I</font>

641
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:32,060
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses of course the level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

642
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:34,310
earphones and what we also that is

643
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:38,240
created a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian checklist and</font>

644
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:40,490
basically this is just a skeleton so

645
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,070
yeah you don't have to really dive into

646
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,600
the technical stuff of the framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

647
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:48,350
how you know the security notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cramer</font>

648
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,750
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just adding markdown files to the</font>

649
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,699
gate airport yeah in the right folder it

650
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,680
will automatically populate this and

651
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:58,130
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can point this one to knowledge</font>

652
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:00,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">base items but also i will show you that</font>

653
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,830
later in the software development life

654
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:06,140
cycle of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security logs framework and</font>

655
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:09,040
so we're now in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the gap the</font>

656
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:13,760
policy development so i created the code

657
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:16,190
and now I can start this section so what

658
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,290
you will see is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

659
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,660
categories well this one it starts with

660
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:23,360
authentication verification requirement

661
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:27,380
where we have different security

662
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:30,770
controls to mitigate well issues and the

663
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:34,160
tech factors on this topic also you can

664
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:37,400
see the report that depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on which</font>

665
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,950
level this item is coming from and the

666
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:43,640
lowest bass vs sort of good one this is

667
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:47,210
really the level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 die hard stuff for ya</font>

668
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:49,550
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important applications and again</font>

669
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:55,420
when we found out and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a really</font>

670
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:59,240
helpful list but yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> even had issues</font>

671
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:01,190
decrypting it like what what doing me

672
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,940
more what what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to achieve</font>

673
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:06,320
with this item and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we all</font>

674
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,050
correlated

675
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">have those items to a knowledge base we</font>

676
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:14,179
can also fetch the description of the

677
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,069
item and show you when you hover over it

678
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:18,168
so you get a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more context</font>

679
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:20,540
about the checklist item that you need

680
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:25,848
to verify that you have implemented it

681
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:30,109
so how I normally or how i am using this

682
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:34,210
is basically together<font color="#E5E5E5"> set with developer</font>

683
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:37,848
i am using my security mindset paranoid

684
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:40,250
human taint analysis right go sit next

685
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:42,319
to him and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm asking the best game a</font>

00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,810
fair fight outpatient resource econ

687
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:47,779
authentication now and he will show me

688
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:50,659
in the code because he has<font color="#CCCCCC"> nicole TS</font>

689
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:53,750
context-aware idealism house food and he

690
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:56,359
will show me how he implemented it then

691
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,609
i will challenge him saying hey you

692
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:02,720
thought about this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see this was</font>

693
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:05,869
about that challenging if it's a good

694
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,169
you no answer good technical answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

695
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:13,550
all good and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we can just say yes</font>

696
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:17,480
this one we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did next one and we go</font>

697
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:19,940
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole list I can already</font>

698
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,280
hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys think like yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's a</font>

699
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:25,130
lot I don't want to go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> section</font>

700
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,800
management edge control malicious input

keep them around reloading data

702
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,780
protection communication and the best

security delicious and business<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

704
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,940
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can blow some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these poor</font>

705
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:40,880
resources I can tell you it takes me

706
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:45,109
together like extreme programming in

707
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,910
good old days it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me like a day</font>

708
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:50,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do this together with the developer</font>

709
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:52,430
and assess and check all the

710
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,619
implementations they did and then I'm

711
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:58,220
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about big web application</font>

712
00:35:54,619 --> 00:36:01,819
project where months of work has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

713
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:04,399
put into so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really by using each other</font>

714
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:06,500
and like like i said i'm using my

715
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,269
colleague developer because he has

716
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,789
cooled<font color="#E5E5E5"> act</font>

717
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:12,038
system how it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been created and I</font>

718
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:14,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenged</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him by using this checklist</font>

719
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:18,429
and looking with him and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

720
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:22,239
challenging so when you submit it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

721
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:24,669
whole list you can again save it the

722
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:27,969
checklist and it will now correlate all

723
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:32,219
those checklist items like a 74 to

724
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:35,589
knowledge base item that is applicable

725
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:39,130
yeah for this one we selected no no no

726
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:41,439
no so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really big big list but</font>

727
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,739
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the output that the</font>

728
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:46,839
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> will give to the developer</font>

729
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:49,119
so first we're all at the 80s will<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill</font>

730
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:51,640
securely and to ensure a text kind of

731
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,829
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all intent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> occasion controls</font>

732
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,558
must<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel securely so this is a</font>

733
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:58,749
knowledge-based item that that's yeah

734
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:03,579
being correlated now to that checklist

735
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:09,999
item well like I said this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a really</font>

736
00:37:03,579 --> 00:37:15,779
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you all so</font>

737
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:15,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can see it's working</font>

738
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:40,650
so I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Safari year when you</font>

739
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,800
download and locate it puts food hakim

740
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:52,110
el at the end of it I don't know why

741
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:59,250
this it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ever and all trace of</font>

742
00:37:52,110 --> 00:38:05,690
course she will trigger too much like i

743
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:05,690
said before then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine no weapons</font>

744
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:24,580
yeah this one does work Safari is not

745
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:38,410
so yeah like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said it will generate the</font>

746
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:41,920
topics and they can send around with

747
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:44,200
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day and get all the table</font>

748
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,730
contents of all the items that has been

749
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:54,730
correlated yeah to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

750
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:58,450
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> item so basically this is like I</font>

751
00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:00,580
said the lowest project yeah the first

752
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:04,319
step in your software development

753
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:07,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifecycle I mean this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like training</font>

754
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting the information to the developer</font>

755
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:19,510
and making them aware of all the attack

756
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:21,759
vectors now I want to go and tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

757
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:25,300
little bit about software development

758
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:29,050
lifecycle yeah we use in the security no

759
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:30,990
tremor the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> log framework uses a</font>

760
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:36,780
couple of continuous integration

761
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:40,089
services for example Travis so yeah

762
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:42,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">jacobs travels basically all sent and</font>

763
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:45,040
well it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> test in the toilet</font>

764
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:47,050
confidence easily seen Gator projects it

765
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,599
has a hoop so if you change something on

766
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:52,450
get there it will notice pulling the new

767
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,730
source and start building your project I

768
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:57,580
use cover models for displaying my unit

769
00:39:54,730 --> 00:40:00,940
testing information in grass and metrics

770
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:03,520
very useful and I use fertilizer for a

771
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:07,060
good quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> check so it will check for</font>

772
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:11,109
duplication called that code that encode

773
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:12,640
of all that stuff because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

774
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:15,970
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all continuous</font>

775
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,490
integration so if the user would modify

776
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:21,310
something on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Gator and the whole</font>

777
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:24,580
chain will be activated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll go</font>

778
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:28,500
through the whole process and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

779
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:33,529
there's also yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> some manual work right</font>

780
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:35,330
and basically yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> to code review so</font>

781
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:37,880
all the code will be read through the

782
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:41,840
first later on you will only pick on the

783
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:44,060
specific hiring is things like you want

784
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,550
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add new type of small functionality</font>

785
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">to locate base your positive forget or</font>

786
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:51,640
change something there I mean user

787
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:54,590
management those are really critical

788
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,810
yeah points<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your application and you</font>

789
00:40:54,590 --> 00:41:00,380
definitely want to code review that and

790
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:02,990
have the 4i principle of course you have

791
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:05,810
further before the sauce so the static

792
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:08,509
application security testing it analyzed

793
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:12,410
it from the inside out and the dust the

794
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:18,230
dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> application well from running</font>

795
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:20,870
point of view<font color="#CCCCCC"> little test yeah and this</font>

796
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:23,090
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I want to do now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is yeah show</font>

797
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:27,830
the demo of the spiritual knowledge

798
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:34,400
framework contains integration so what

799
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:39,259
what will happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so let's see um</font>

800
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:42,560
first I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you the trophies</font>

801
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:45,260
the code quality and applause so in here

802
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,240
we have the Travis CI and that is hook

803
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:50,720
together so they can now make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

804
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,430
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get traction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this pull a new</font>

805
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,180
source on github and start building

806
00:41:52,430 --> 00:42:00,109
project with new changes in here we can

807
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:03,020
have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> album and so as</font>

808
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:05,750
you can see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed my get a project</font>

809
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:10,070
that installs dependencies it installs

810
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus it installs coverage it runs the</font>

811
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:17,390
setter and tested and that went<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh kehri</font>

812
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:20,120
then we use the fire test module and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

813
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:22,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">gather and generate the metrics of the</font>

814
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">human testing and when the unit testing</font>

815
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:28,910
has been false then we called the

816
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:34,140
corporal's and dip take the metrics two

817
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:38,129
corporals and corporals is also surface

818
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:42,029
and will display your metrics very nice

819
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:44,450
way also what I really like is yeah the

820
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:48,569
corporate shell when somebody is

821
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:51,210
creating or destroying your

822
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:53,339
functionality and then working and the

823
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:55,380
coverage will drop because one unit

824
00:42:53,339 --> 00:43:02,788
<font color="#CCCCCC">tests no school will fail so you have</font>

825
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">instant feedback that I may move so very</font>

826
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:11,579
nice yeah indicator of<font color="#E5E5E5"> something is not</font>

827
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:14,220
good right and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the controls has</font>

828
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:17,309
successfully been run then we have two

829
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:19,230
lost contains integration service and

830
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:21,420
that's the scrutinize er I what

831
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:24,450
scrutinize you will do it will see what

832
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:26,880
type of new<font color="#E5E5E5"> functionality is added and</font>

833
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:30,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">low in this case it will also tell you</font>

834
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:34,140
when it got worse so duplication code

835
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:37,890
there ain't a lot like a 74 again and

836
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:41,460
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> every commit to to get that project</font>

837
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:43,740
you can immediately see if the greatest

838
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:47,640
dropping and somebody's messing up

839
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:49,950
somebody is slacking right they don't do

840
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:56,420
proper job otherwise the code would

841
00:43:49,950 --> 00:44:00,960
improve or be stable right and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I</font>

842
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:04,529
would do a demo about yeah just showing

843
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:08,190
you the whole chain and yeah how to be

844
00:44:04,529 --> 00:44:13,769
run so first I'm going to do a normal

845
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:16,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">one it we just taking it built it</font>

846
00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:18,720
everything go okay because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just added</font>

847
00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:24,230
the space to read me so that can go

848
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:28,640
wrong you think so if you now go back

849
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,640
then we can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the Travis</font>

850
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:37,740
and practice normally it will pick it up

851
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:44,730
and we'll pull in the source and start

852
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:48,629
building that's also nice to mention

853
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:52,289
Travis is fully free to use if you have

854
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:54,690
an open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> project by the way older</font>

855
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:56,880
than the continuous integration the

856
00:44:54,690 --> 00:45:00,960
speedy louis from everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> i talked</font>

857
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,420
about today is a resource<font color="#CCCCCC"> move is usable</font>

858
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,099
by up source projects so if you want to

859
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in your company like traveling</font>

860
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:09,930
here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you have your own</font>

861
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:12,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">office work or you can get it for free</font>

862
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:16,828
set it up and yeah and all the benefits

863
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:19,829
of it as you can see here Travis noticed

864
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:22,260
the change from github started a new

865
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:24,150
build job as you can see here it's

866
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,940
already running for 40 seconds and

867
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:29,039
basically it's yeah now installing the

868
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,970
whole security military work installing

869
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:38,069
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> appendices all the modules as needed</font>

870
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:40,078
capital elec xml well it takes around 20

871
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:42,058
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> two minutes and then the whole</font>

872
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,819

flow as you can see when it's finished

876
00:45:53,730 --> 00:46:01,099

877
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:01,099
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

878
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:29,250
48 so this will let the<font color="#CCCCCC"> build fill</font>

879
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:34,440
because we now have a sim pox error and

880
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:43,259
this one is almost gone and you can also

881
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:47,279
download follow the walk and yeah all

882
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:49,349
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> gas you see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's normal manual work</font>

883
00:46:47,279 --> 00:46:51,599
right you have to oh I made new release

884

886
00:46:54,299 --> 00:46:59,970
yeah but I already installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the module</font>

887
00:46:56,609 --> 00:47:02,098
and modify something and with a new

888
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:05,189
fresh install I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to mod you</font>

889
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:07,920
and it build the bills bills things like

890
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:12,059
that right and now you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> automate it</font>

891
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:14,910
all the way you know let continues

892
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:23,789
integrate in your build cycle and we

893
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:28,980
also modify the other one so I hope see

894
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:31,470
the change we made a few seconds ago and

895
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:36,000
as you will notice it will then say our

896
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:39,470
bill failing and also on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our the github</font>

897
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,380
project page it will display it like

898
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:45,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah built field red immediately you can</font>

899
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,910
see there's something wrong at the same

900
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:54,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing for coverage in the same thing for</font>

901
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:54,230
the scrutinize<font color="#CCCCCC"> ur home traveling</font>

902
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change that's good</font>

903
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,080
ah here it is it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

904
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:40,200
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see here the unit testing</font>

905
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,800
is now failing cannot run the unit test

906
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:49,819
me anymore error here if now we go back

907
00:48:43,800 --> 00:49:01,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the normal project you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

908
00:48:49,820 --> 00:49:03,540
pressure it's right over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well</font>

909
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:07,020
the image is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit slow but</font>

910
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:11,579
normally it will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> read filled and you</font>

911
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:14,579
know immediately that's wrong also a

912
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:18,000
good thing is when you make a fork of

913
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:21,630
this project<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you develop in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

914
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,540
home and get up account the framework it

915
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:27,770
will also still trigger all the traffic

916
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:31,190
is the scrutinize ER and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporate</font>

917
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:33,900
so even if you forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

918
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:36,000
contributors the other developers or

919
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,060
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same contagious integrations</font>

920
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:43,079
or even though it's not you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

921
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:45,779
get a project it will all see it it will

922
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:48,119
take it with it and also when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

923
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:50,369
make modifications you see in your own

924
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:53,220
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your own branch in your own</font>

925
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:55,920
gather the bills paying the bill passing

926
00:49:53,220 --> 00:50:03,089
and you know all the metrics of that

927
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:06,359
code yeah and then Wow an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of how</font>

928
00:50:03,089 --> 00:50:08,040
you would define a Travis hall and

929
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:11,240
basically this is to set up the

930
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:14,779
instructions on how to track

931
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:17,089
image and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they did that you can run</font>

932
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:19,250
a test<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> project known as you can see</font>

933
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:22,360
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also try and do multiple</font>

934
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:26,830
heightened versions to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

935
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:32,840
conference were all the persian new ones

936
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:38,540
and I was hoping now this is now yep

937
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:50,380
bill paid and so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> scratch now back</font>

938
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:53,090
to the yeah so to summarize first yeah

939
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:55,280
choose a nice vs level as a security

940
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:57,350
environment and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> note like ash vs</font>

941
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,590
you can also<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick another one there's no</font>

942
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:02,600
problem well apply the acute most

943
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:05,450
favorite in the pre-development page for

944
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:08,600
awareness why where possible the

945
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:11,210
continuous integration tool you don't

946
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:13,640
forget the plug about the manual<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdl say</font>

947
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:18,200
work because there's always known you

948
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:21,920
were the only tool in our helpful and

949
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:25,160
you know it's good stuff with ya still

950
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:29,780
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to manual interpreted and check</font>

951
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:35,480
it verify it Thea and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do code reviewing</font>

952
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:37,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">Met bullpen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> testing of course yeah apply</font>

953
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,230
the security mulch framework

954
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:43,609
post-development so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

955
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:45,920
before I self verification yeah and then

956
00:51:43,609 --> 00:51:49,279
you just created the part of the web

957
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,980
securely indirectly and like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

958
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:54,619
before all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> surfaces</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used to mention</font>

959
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:56,990
this talk can be used at you have no

960
00:51:54,619 --> 00:52:00,680
source project so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i encourage everybody</font>

00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:01,680
to use them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know how</font>

962
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to implement</font>

963
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,200
tutorials<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pages and of course you can</font>

964
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:17,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a look at the security no Trevor</font>

965
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:21,598
how we set it up so yeah again yeah

966
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:23,579
getting involved we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to share</font>

967
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,640
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> village make it even better as</font>

968
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:30,599
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we also you know hooking into</font>

969
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:33,629
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vs team to add fill in there and</font>

yeah I know that you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are mobile you</font>

971
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:37,589
know I experienced people with also

972
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:42,480
knowledge and yeah we should share this

973
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:45,450
information because yeah I cannot bear

974
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,750
to see them<font color="#CCCCCC"> more all those weekly</font>

975
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">insecure applications it's also my day</font>

976
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:57,660
that is in there not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yours I see it</font>

977

is a win-win for everybody yeah so

978
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:03,828
questions was a lot of information so i

979
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:16,910
imagine cup of chocolate whoever and

980
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:16,910
particular satellite

981
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:30,100
so yeah they basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we first in like</font>

982
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:35,220
a year ago before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we really had to</font>

983
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:39,330
framework me we use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dutch checklist</font>

984
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:42,640
it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that expensive ask me as well</font>

985
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:45,700
no there was again an open source type

986
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">of organization that also want to add</font>

987
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:51,189
transparency and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to ya</font>

988
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:57,160
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> checklist from how to properly do</font>

989
00:53:51,190 --> 00:54:01,840
it but yeah it is a mixture of a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

990
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:05,220
experience like I said I<font color="#CCCCCC"> started out</font>

991
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:08,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is a web application developer and</font>

992
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:11,799
yeah again I saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of security</font>

993
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">issues and was really intrigued by it</font>

994
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:18,280
and picking that up I was hacking since

995
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:20,800
I was 13 at the no tumor and modifying

996
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:24,210
the engine building aimbots stuff like

997
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:28,859
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I picked that interest up again</font>

998
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:32,680
and then I moved after four years to

999
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:35,740

1000
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:38,560
tester close over to there for 14 years

1001
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:43,060
and yeah now i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> working at Sugar</font>

1002
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:46,779
Phyllis a security engineer yeah so like

1003
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:49,420
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the ass he has to check</font>

1004
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:51,850
this itself that's of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course all work of</font>

1005
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:54,010
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and all the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1006
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:57,210
contributed and with all the knowledge

1007
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:59,380
base items all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code examples</font>

1008
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:01,420
about the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the three federal</font>

1009
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:05,560
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Feldman that is something we</font>

1010
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:08,050
created so yeah and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes a</font>

1011
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:11,890
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said more complex and</font>

1012
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:13,990
even we had issues like that so for

1013
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:16,810
developer it should really<font color="#E5E5E5"> blown his</font>

1014
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:20,649
mind like<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you wanted to use with ya</font>

1015
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:24,630
couldn't they were still yeah but still

1016
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,630
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> reach right to our so</font>

1017
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:50,060
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's true so we also have a very</font>

1018
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:52,700
extensive read me a scare also like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1019
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:54,940
mentioned before all services we use our

1020
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:58,390
free if you have an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source project</font>

1021
00:55:54,940 --> 00:56:00,650
we really needed I oh I really love this

1022
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:04,879
disservice because it gives you the

1023
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:07,099
opportunity to style yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a little</font>

1024
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit better I also a support function</font>

1025
00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:12,319
where you can chat and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have discussions</font>

1026
00:56:08,359 --> 00:56:15,589
with people so and to answer your

1027
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:17,630
question when we go to the installation

1028
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:20,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see for every well basically every</font>

1029
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:25,400
platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> you boon to Mac Windows how to</font>

1030
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:28,220
set it up I also get an A an Apache very

1031
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:31,450
set up so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also fit into real web</font>

1032
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:35,209
server and well do proper telus

1033
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:39,399
hardening and because i<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out flaws</font>

1034
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:43,510
I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so if I spin the</font>

1035
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:46,310
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> Loki I only get like a</font>

1036
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:49,329
philosophy I estrellas palliative and

1037
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:54,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">built the real perfect forward secrecy</font>

1038
00:56:49,329 --> 00:56:57,650
ciphers and the real good stop right so

1039
00:56:54,890 --> 00:57:01,609
yeah so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we decided also to be</font>

1040
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:04,720
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> creator how to for this and for later</font>

1041
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:08,540
vision where we also want to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1042
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:12,950
big enterprise environments where they

1043
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:16,490
want users and others and separation of

1044
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:17,629
documents and projects yeah where it is

1045
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:21,680
also will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1046
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:23,809
useful also building and working on the

1047
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,910
docker installation so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a</font>

1048
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:30,259
blogger you can just type<font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer</font>

1049
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:32,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">after running but yeah we move focus now</font>

1050
00:57:30,259 --> 00:57:34,460
bore as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> service because a lot of</font>

1051
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:37,460
companies with him<font color="#E5E5E5"> only implement this</font>

1052
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:40,220
and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said before when we created</font>

1053
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:44,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">this project the initial phase it was</font>

1054
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:48,740
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> finished it was for developers to</font>

1055
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:53,240
help you guide you and yeah we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1056
00:57:48,740 --> 00:58:00,609
again we see the need so yeah we also

1057
00:57:53,240 --> 00:58:04,490
going to make a search out of it so yeah

1058
00:58:00,609 --> 00:58:09,609
the little tab which is my understanding

1059
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:12,339
is the longest that process if there any

1060
00:58:09,609 --> 00:58:15,950
possibility that that could be

1061
00:58:12,339 --> 00:58:19,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">semi-automated so you got the code that</font>

1062
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:22,359
is not included in your CI then you both

1063
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:26,930
tonight I didn't be experimenting on it

1064
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:29,180
could you know do the static code

1065
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:32,868
analysis and about that exactly bring

1066
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in yahoo report but yeah why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font>

1067
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:39,140
manual because the output those tooling

1068
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:44,319
boss sauce will generate will need

1069
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:50,480
manual<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to validate and verify and</font>

1070
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:52,160
like you solve the great sauce to live

1071
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,369
as shown in the year for one of the

1072
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:58,848
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> other speakers it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to</font>

1073
00:58:55,369 --> 00:59:01,609
cover everything with it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say</font>

1074
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:04,190
to everybody use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you know if it's</font>

1075
00:59:01,609 --> 00:59:07,240
possible and it doesn't generate a lot

1076
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:10,190
of manual work do it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would prefer</font>

1077
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:12,220
doing security by design and<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

1078
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:15,660
knowledge yourself and from there

1079
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:19,470
choosing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right path</font>

1080
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:22,140
that's so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> also why we created</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1081
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:25,078
whole security<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lola chamber we could</font>

1082
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:28,680
have created another tool that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast</font>

1083
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:32,150
a knack for you but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developer</font>

1084
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:36,299
isn't being ditched so he will make

1085
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:40,530
pretty easy again the next time you

1086
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:42,150
increase the similar type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of law and</font>

1087
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:45,859
yeah what we're really trying to do here

1088
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:50,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">is well giving you a fishing rod and</font>

1089
00:59:45,859 --> 00:59:53,119
telling you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you can fish and and so</font>

1090
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:56,730
you can provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> for yourself instead of</font>

1091
00:59:53,119 --> 01:00:01,500
buying your fish and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> X 2 days it's</font>

1092
00:59:56,730 --> 01:00:05,940
stinky you know the story this is you

1093
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:08,579
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same vision and</font>

1094
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:11,609
story the the aviation have right they

1095
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:15,380
are sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> information and why is that</font>

1096
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:19,470
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah our lives depends on it if</font>

1097
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:22,230
no one customer agency has the same type

1098
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:24,390
of airplane ya wanna go to detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1099
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:28,619
other one like I do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can crash down</font>

1100
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:31,500
and you know you see in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that field this</font>

1101
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:34,829
is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> common already and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

1102
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:37,230
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go into a plane safely you know</font>

1103
01:00:34,829 --> 01:00:41,039
fly and land because they are working

1104
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:44,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">together so I think with this project we</font>

1105
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:44,569
should go and have the same

1106
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:53,339
mindset right Sharon it's all over<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

1107
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:55,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're like I said before it's also the</font>

1108
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:59,550
intent to codex home it's all in

1109
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:02,399
markdown<font color="#CCCCCC"> form up so even if you don't</font>

1110
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:04,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">have really technical skills about</font>

1111
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:08,310
fighting over effort or still can add

1112
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:11,840
code examples of knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> base</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> items or</font>

1113
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:11,840
extend the checklist

1114
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,310
you
