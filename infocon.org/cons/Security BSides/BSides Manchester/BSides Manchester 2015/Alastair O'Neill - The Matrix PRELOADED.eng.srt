even though they change the option they

debugging message and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know private super leaf no one has them</font>

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,889
and some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them are just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like really</font>

149
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:15,919
really egotistical like this which

150
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:17,750
includes a weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bible quote because</font>

151
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,590
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> more dramatic than the</font>

152
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,590
Bible to make your

153
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,230
but they're actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> all kind of</font>

154
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">terrible and there's varying levels of</font>

155
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,300
terrible but they are all terrible

156
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:36,310
because the only privilege<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gene pool</font>

157
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,380
is quite small they're all based on only

158
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,000
a handful of different like rootkits

159
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,850
basically and only a<font color="#CCCCCC"> small amount of</font>

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,760
research it means that any problems in

161
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,500
implementation or any strange design

162
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,039
choices tend to propagate because wicked

163
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,510
writers are lazy it turns out they<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

164
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,430
to copy each other's code they liked it

165
00:07:52,510 --> 00:08:01,300
not bother looking at so the good<font color="#E5E5E5"> news</font>

166
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that is that it makes it easier</font>

167
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,740
for us to the techno to remove them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

168
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,450
the bad news<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also makes it</font>

169
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,670
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> for someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who is a lot scarier</font>

170
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:13,060
to come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and use them to elevate</font>

171
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,350
privileges or so on and I mean even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

172
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,790
you catch the initial privilege

173
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,590
escalation so we used to install<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

174
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:25,870
these were kids they essentially hand

175
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:28,289
out room like a hawk<font color="#E5E5E5"> exes worrying so</font>

176
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,250
we've talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they are so</font>

177
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,320
we're going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flaws in</font>

178
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,380
hell they're designed we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

179
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,260
talk about how their design leads you to

180
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,990
be able to remove them or to and use

181
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,980
them for privilege escalation and one

182
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,810
thing that I'm not going to be

183
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:48,150
discussing<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a bad</font>

184
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:51,750
idea is the idea of compromising lovely

185
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be bad</font>

186
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:58,630
so I've written some code which least a

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,850
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months ago and one is a very very</font>

188
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:06,310
small winery it's 109 bytes or so I

189
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,110
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe hundred ninety and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just as</font>

190
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the leads etc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lb got sort of preload</font>

191
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:15,670
it's written in assembly and it's very

192
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:17,650
small and then i<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote a perl script</font>

193
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,689
that detects one of the rootkit skull

194
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:22,840
design so it had dates over sixes and

195
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,870
variables and it detects that are on

196
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:30,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">sores and so my github is I'm said march</font>

197
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:33,700
market if you can find all out there so

198
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:38,290
the family tree of using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android kids is</font>

199
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,550
kind of fairly basic so in 2009 it's the

200
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,089
earliest sample of any root collective

201
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,790
funny is one called LD minutes Venus oh

202
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:49,210
and there's only one<font color="#CCCCCC"> reference to it</font>

203
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:51,280
it's some guys from 2000 i talked about

204
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,980
how he got compromised by this painting

205
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:58,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">lost remove and no one else apparently</font>

206
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">has ever been infected by it so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

207
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,680
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how widespread it was if anyone has</font>

208
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,110
ever actually seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or heard about it</font>

209
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,500
please tell me and and then it was

210
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,810
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> quiet from that up until 2011</font>

211
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,110
when a rootkit called jinx released by a

212
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:17,589
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> called black hat and Academy and</font>

213
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:19,240
there's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> back at library and it was</font>

214
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,850
an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source i'll be pretty large it</font>

215
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,650
was fairly simple and it hit some files

216
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:27,520
it had a reverse shell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cold</font>

217
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:30,420
and in 2012 they released an updated

218
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,760
version called Jing speak to which is

219
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,150
sort of the de facto father of most of

220
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other bridges</font>

221
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:42,520
2011 a private room kit was released and

222
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:45,910
privately to like blackademy people and

223
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> friends called gallon it's very</font>

224
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,689
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to jinx</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few differences</font>

225
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,060
which will cover later but it'sit's

226
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,730
ultimately quite similar and 2011 that

227
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,599
was also live underscore underscore MDMA

228
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,220
which is being actively developed and

229
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,080
latest Iowa South 2013 I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for any news but i'm sure the probably</font>

231
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,370
are some from last year so that's out

232
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:11,440
there in the world I've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> catalyzed</font>

238
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,000
pretty good<font color="#CCCCCC"> I only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got the 2015 version</font>

239
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">this weekend so unfortunately it's not</font>

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,930
much in it but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't actually get</font>

241
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:36,220
it to work without segfault on my VM

constant so<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the pinch of salt and</font>

243
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:42,550
in 2014 the Bible quote one Azazel and

244
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,529
it's troy from Jenks it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight up</font>

245
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,930
copy of jenks essentially but it's been

246
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:49,600
totally rewritten and functional should

247
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:53,650
have changed it has some extra

248
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,390
functionality and that is what inspired

249
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,699
this talk because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember talk about</font>

250
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,560
how great was and how would you know

251
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,029
avoided all these forensics but no one

252
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,589
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it ever and</font>

253
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:04,589
apparently because

254
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:12,149
so there's some common functionality

255
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,009
across from kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font>

256
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,240
there's a back door you want access to

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,540
or small I like like however it works

266
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,229
hide network connections and the way

other ways of doing that from using

<font color="#E5E5E5">if it's a back door so you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surf</font>

284
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,920
you're actively factoring existing

285
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:30,149
connections so things like Isis HD and

286
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,469
so on and generally you occasionally see

287
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:33,360
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hatchet password to the back door</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">takes that one not always but sometimes</font>

289
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,459
and another piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of functionality</font>

290
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:44,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing these are Pam hooks which I'll</font>

291
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:47,518
talk about here we are and so Pam is

292
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:51,029
plural authentication and modules in

293
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,040
minutes basically it's a set of

294
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:55,290
authentication functions and tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

295
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,250
allow you to authenticate things like a

296
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:02,849
cessation so on and a bunch of user and

297
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:05,630
rootkits and use these functions to give

298
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:08,400
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

299
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,260
the reason they do this is because you

300
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">only need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hook about three or four</font>

301
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,830
pound<font color="#CCCCCC"> functions something there's like</font>

303
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,930
others but it's very very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

304
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of code and you can</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">bite or ssh without Dorian you doing and</font>

306
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,670
but it's it's horrible the one the one

307
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,709
thing that's bad about them getting this

308
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,020
though is they usually need to because

309
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,670
Pam does encompass like every linux

310
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,410
distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the box if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

311
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,939
suddenly find you've got Pam all over

312
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,620
your box then it's probably even

313
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">backdoor my son guy is trying to like</font>

314
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:44,190
install it to gain access to insulation

315
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,240
so we should talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more</font>

316
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:51,630
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> route gets so they'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave let</font>

317
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,460
me feed us so and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said it's only</font>

318
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,030
really mentioned in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> blog I only have</font>

319
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:59,640
one sample and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't give me a</font>

320
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:01,800
whole lot to talk about and that's the

321
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,500
first is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the first killer can find</font>

322
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,630
and again it doesn't it's got a lot of

323
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,110
functionality and for something that was

324
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,790
made you know and six years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago it's got</font>

325
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,800
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool stuff cuz it discovered</font>

326
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,599
later independently so it's got Pam

327
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,660
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it does it in a</font>

328
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,570
different manner and but it's got it not

329
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,100
quite cool and it had all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the passwords</font>

330
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,660
and ever hashed which you don't see

331
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:31,170
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 2012 and its really really</font>

332
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,510
early so I played<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the idea that it</font>

333
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,329
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be related to jinx somehow or</font>

334
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,790
maybe the offer and went on later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font>

335
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:41,220
rotates and but in the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> i discarded</font>

336
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:44,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I did because it's just got so much</font>

337
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:50,640
functionality and and jinx really

338
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:52,770
doesn't so<font color="#CCCCCC"> sticky things so I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

339
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is the grandfather rfl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we minutes</font>

340
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,250
grandfather this is sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the father</font>

341
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:59,010
this is like the main ancestor of

342
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,900
everything so there's two versions

343
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:06,120
they've both been publicly released

344
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:08,939
their code is on github and under the

345
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,040
user choke point I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and so</font>

346
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,470
the way they differ is back door

347
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">mechanisms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jynx version one used a</font>

348
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:21,630
reverse shell triggered by 49<font color="#E5E5E5"> genes</font>

349
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:24,750
version 2 uses an exception which uses

350
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:27,060
existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> listing services and they took</font>

351
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,800
a relatively small engine function it's

352
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,660
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> me absolutely very minimal to give</font>

353
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">my phones from lincoln LS and so on and</font>

354
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:38,490
the way it allows the malware right or

355
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,160
malware user to interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

356
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,080
operating system itself when you want to

357
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,079
see files are they are is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has its own</font>

358
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:50,370
second and library called<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not so</font>

359
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:54,330
which essentially them uses the original

360
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:56,070
see calls and it's kind of a messy way

361
00:16:54,330 --> 00:17:04,740
because it made early because itself

362
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:09,570
well we've got gallon as well so Galan

363
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:12,839
is a private ryan to jinx it has an

364
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:15,419
accepted fact on and but the extent back

365
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,800
door is crazy it has its own clients

366
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,540
that you need to generate a conflict

367
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:24,119
file for with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python script</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and</font>

368
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:28,590
it's overkill it uses like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm some</font>

369
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:32,040
crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> AES and two fish crypto to like</font>

371
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:38,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">doors hatched and obviously</font>

372
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:42,149
and but the one thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong with the</font>

373
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:44,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">effort that is to like make this crazy</font>

374
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:46,620
back door it's still like really really

375
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:52,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">big in fairly potent options it's fairly</font>

376
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:54,299
simple and you'll see how about it is so

377
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:58,168
we've got label underscore underscore n

378
00:17:54,299 --> 00:18:00,870
da da so which is obviously legitimate

379
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:02,850
by coming anytime you see live MDMA on

380
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:06,779
your box you think break cool just

381
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,908

383
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:14,369
that so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think or at least it seems to</font>

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:16,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">have independently discovered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font>

the same things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my LD monthly</font>

dancer and it's being actively developed

387
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,249
and it's out there in the wild again the

388
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,629

396
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:49,080
it's pretty good umbreon version tube is

397
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:51,360
a real pain to remove and<font color="#CCCCCC"> my brown</font>

398

which was released this year and check

401
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:58,590
out this weekend i haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

402
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,029
managed to get to work it without

psychotic everything see and it's on

404
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:07,289
sale and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few sort of underground forms</font>

405
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,059
you know there's the occasional kayak

00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:14,249
for them sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> truck one hundred</font>

407
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:15,480
dollars a pop and so yeah it is being

408
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:18,269
actively developed there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,830
versions version one isn't being

410
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:22,409
actively developed version 2 is the

411
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">primary you getting fixes and those two</font>

412
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:25,960
differ by their back doors is like James

413
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:28,090
one is

414
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,559
and then there's a third<font color="#E5E5E5"> version which</font>

415
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:35,049
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being actively build and that differs</font>

416
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:37,690
what if it doesn't work blue passwords

417
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:39,970
on inter hatched and and it cooks an

418
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,980
awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> functions and it's much</font>

419
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,770
better hiding something making sub

420
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,919
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remove and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a real</font>

421
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:51,480
pain unless you know and unless you're

422
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,480
lucky it's quite difficult removing fine

423
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:59,408
and another publicly released and work

424
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,289
it source it's on choke point again

425
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:04,360
because it's the same guys and there's a

426
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:06,129
private<font color="#CCCCCC"> version apparently allegedly you</font>

427
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,620
haven't seen it but you never know and

428
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,809
it's designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be reversible resistant</font>

429
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">to to forensics so all the hooks have</font>

430
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:15,490
been rewritten and it uses so we're

431
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,940
gonna skate all the strings in the body

432
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:21,730
so the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line resets of</font>

433
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,370
England so on and so forth and it has

434
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:26,409
content acacia numbers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in its in</font>

435
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:32,340
its<font color="#E5E5E5"> defense it tries to be stealthy it</font>

436
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:35,679
doesn't like it there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dries so</font>

437
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,480
mostly top will avoid discussing

438
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,880
statically compiled tools because anyone

439
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,340
can compile<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit hard and remove it I</font>

440
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,230
mean I wrote a tiny thing to do it

441
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself it's it's an assembly was fun</font>

442
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:49,899
but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> simply to do that so it's more</font>

443
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:55,990
interesting to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the false mail</font>

444
00:20:49,899 --> 00:21:00,360
these things so obviously the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first file</font>

445
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:03,909
is that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> message that buys em</font>

446
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,908
so ldd is a little utility that prints

447
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:10,929
and a list of like loaded libraries and

448
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:12,940
by dividing and and that led itself is a

449
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:15,890
bash script the restaurant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

450
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:18,400
does so which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our program</font>

451
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,990
we shared library 310 peoples on earth

452
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">LD that so is actually statically</font>

453
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,820
compiled so admittedly I am kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

454
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,710
talking about avoiding studying while

455
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,510
tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> or hoop but this one is pretty</font>

456
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">good for detecting and it's easy for any</font>

457
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:36,290
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's a standard</font>

458
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:38,780
clinics and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the output</font>

459
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:40,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">of LED min ago she look like you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

460
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:44,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> escape that silly now let's see you</font>

461
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:48,460
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> lb minutes this is what it looks</font>

462
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:53,480
like after jinx has been installed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> M</font>

463
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:56,720
echo now needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> lit k5 crypto the best</font>

464
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,780
cell and it also needs that mysteriously

465
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:03,140
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> xxxx against jinx tuna so I wonder</font>

466
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,430
what that would be um so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

467
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,260
this is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the easiest way to</font>

468
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:09,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">decorate because you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never really</font>

469
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:11,150
miss that if everything is now using

470
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:15,470
like live ssl looks to something right

471
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:19,700
now so yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

472
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:21,680
fatal forms of these or hundreds there's

473
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,660
no real way to get around it except for

474
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,490
doing something really really disgusting

475
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,100
not to engage that create function which

476
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:33,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">is how programs are sort of like</font>

477
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:35,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">launching eyes and and killing it and</font>

478
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,340
this thing will always tell you where

479
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,900
they look it is so once you know where

480
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,870
it lives you you're on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to</font>

481
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,570
getting rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and solar route it's</font>

482
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:48,169
too bright LED umbreon those to an exact

483
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,879
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and and you get a desire but if</font>

484
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:53,470
you get start getting bizarre<font color="#E5E5E5"> errors on</font>

485
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:56,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">led you know something's up and and</font>

486
00:22:53,470 --> 00:23:01,190
since there's also live LD minutes and

487
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:03,080
that's a tattoo and LG 2.18 that so or

488
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever you call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can also</font>

489
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,879
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

490
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,669
break those or evening it's like copy

491
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,740
them into a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> angle and there's</font>

492
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:15,940
not really any way<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can stop that</font>

493
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:19,990
easily but even though you know where it

494
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:22,660
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't necessarily do it so here</font>

495
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have drinks and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LED</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we try and</font>

496
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">remove it without Ram I can't remove it</font>

497
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,899
although we do get told it's a rib right

498
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,790
protected regular file so know it exists

499
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:38,710
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen up such file or directory</font>

500
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:41,168
air so it hides itself in XX drinks by

501
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:46,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">cooking things like open talking things</font>

502
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:50,230
like what still on their mobile and so

503
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:53,200
on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> forth so what options do we have</font>

504
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:57,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">if we can't go into XX jinx we could try</font>

505
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,650
CD so yeah jinx doesn't even look<font color="#E5E5E5"> CH</font>

506
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">there so you can always change directory</font>

507
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:05,500
into the working drink and you still

508
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,820
can't open it with file or whatever but

509
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,470
you at least know you're in the

510
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:15,040
directory you least know it exists so CD

511
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:19,390
works file and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> using open done so</font>

512
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:22,120
we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the rootkit exists know</font>

513
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:24,100
where it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we know that it</font>

514
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,610
stinks because it says cheeks too so we

515
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,409
can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> really that's so so we can</font>

516
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:32,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually prove a reality that cell and</font>

517
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,960
like see the operating system as it is

518
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:38,020
and there's no authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

519
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,610
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you know it</font>

520
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:44,820
it'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a cooler things don't</font>

521
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,820
again so

522
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:52,259
so oh yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> James kept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open as well</font>

523
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:55,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">right but now that's gonna be important</font>

524
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:57,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bit and once you're in the directory</font>

525
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:59,039
and if what you're calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't use</font>

526
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,049
the absolute path to the directory and

527
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:05,399
the XX chinks won't be included in the

528
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:07,320
function<font color="#E5E5E5"> call so don't need to work so</font>

529
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:10,070
certain programs won't ever be rotated

530
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,450
or affected by the jinx functionals and

531
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,399
as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> that once we have really done</font>

532
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,750
so we are immune to all the week we see

533
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:19,860
the operating system as it is so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

534
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:23,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">just remove it but that's boring so</font>

535
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's do the bonus round so if you</font>

536
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:28,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">stream this jinx to you look for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X X</font>

537
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">Games</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the way Jenks does privilege</font>

538
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:33,330
escalation is it checks for environment

539
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:36,480
variable before and a soy de binary

540
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:38,850
being watched so you can just strings

541
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,519
the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab the environment variable</font>

542
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:44,340
and then your route you prickly just

543
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">like really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easily there's no and alpha</font>

544
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">skates you again there's nothing hiding</font>

545
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,500
this it's just lying there any strings

546
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:53,330
on the library without eating

547
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:56,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">pre-loading is really well designed and</font>

548
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:59,149
so it's not obligated it's not in its

549
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,379
always in the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> location jinx and</font>

550
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:03,570
then you always<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to straight</font>

551
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:06,719
man so you always find it you'll always

552
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:08,700
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply elevated privileges and</font>

553

escape the function<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's when you do</font>

that's Oprah got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it too so if the guy</font>

change the name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the J's library</font>

itself to be

565
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:43,668
well because we talk quickly about open

566
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,309
but not on 64 minutes you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

567
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:48,530
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can sue the route you know it's</font>

568
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:53,030
there you can go into etc LD<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort</font>

569
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:56,260
of preload and it's gone because um yeah

570
00:26:53,030 --> 00:27:00,410
it uses only 64 instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> wellman so</font>

571
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:08,090
that's pretty but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just overwrite</font>

572
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:09,770
the file that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's nice so yeah</font>

00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:12,049

based on Jesus except from fails at home

575
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:17,620
hooking up 64 I don't know why they just

576
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:20,030
copy the same code for everything and

577
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,159
having probably changing I mean let's

578
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:25,360
take care right they must be spent days

579
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,130
on this crazy interconnector at least

580
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:32,719
maybe even months of work and you can

581
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:34,429
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> do like that go let's go and so</font>

582
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,870
yeah they're all follow these users<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:38,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ricky's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are based on jinx that's why you</font>

584
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:42,620
have that it means the removing is

585
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,970
tribute all the time it's not as fun as

586
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,330
privileged escalating but it's effective

587
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:50,030
it's easy to do and it strikes me is

588
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:54,470
where that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have the I 686 original</font>

591
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:08,600
by doing it just removed 170 characters

592
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:11,330
done and so other rootkits so again

<font color="#E5E5E5">think of how they broke up the top of my</font>

doesn't have that an environment

619
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:29,678
variable for privilege escalation so you

don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that option sadly and</font>

are roof and your group ID and this is

00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,520
1337 for example you'll be able to see

the others

635
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:14,600
if not evil and so it's a good idea in

636
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,940
practice the boys reality that so which

object<font color="#E5E5E5"> dump the library there is like</font>

642
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,990
because it talks about 100 something

643
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,149
functions you have like 100 different

644
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:37,220
compared instructions that are all

645
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,110
checking for this one giv so you can

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,970
simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull it out change your key ID to</font>

647
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,290
it there you go there's also an

648
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:48,110
environment variable which you can use

649
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:52,420
to privilege escalation and here is an

650
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:58,669
example of the compare so 84 compares

651
00:30:52,420 --> 00:31:02,210
like you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss that and that</font>

652
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:05,570
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> Umbreon does hook up in 64 it makes</font>

653
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:07,550
it really annoying to remove and it

654
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,010
doesn't install itself to a folder and

655
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:12,560
protect that like jinx and protects

656
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:15,650
itself and added the folder it usually

657
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:17,899
shares the name because 100m it also

658
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,940
uses chatter which you aren't familiar

659
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,320
with there is extended<font color="#E5E5E5"> filesystem</font>

660
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,680
attributes and Linux which allow you to

<font color="#E5E5E5">set and sort of permissions on a file at</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">being like you can't normally delete it</font>

666
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,560
remove and which is fine when they're

667
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,360
not cooking functions and trying to like

668
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:45,500
rip you probably but when they are then

669
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,270
that's real pain and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Umbreon is kind of</font>

670
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,860
flawed and sometimes there's like

671
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:52,970
there's a race condition in the install

672
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:57,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">strip so sometimes it doesn't it writes</font>

673
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:59,900
the location to etc LD that soda preload

674
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:02,210
first but only includes file and not the

675
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">library so you're just end up getting</font>

676
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:06,119
loads and loads of an LD preload<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aires</font>

677
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:10,739
on

678
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:12,658
and there's a room duh pin tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> for and</font>

679
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:14,309
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me when it's messed up and that</font>

680
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:16,379
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty well but yeah I mean it's</font>

681
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:19,019
kind of weird of the install script has

682
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:29,129
a race condition right you can it can

683
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:31,289
break it as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> so M zazzle has a number</font>

684
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:34,228
of kind of cool features so the first

685
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:37,559
feature that it has which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting</font>

686
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:39,479
is that when it instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking ldd</font>

687
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:41,969
when your room you try to weld ed things

688
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:43,919
as as will move itself before you do

689
00:32:41,969 --> 00:32:46,919
that so it looks exactly it's easier and

690
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">LBP and it actually copies itself to a</font>

691
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,789
different directory and then

692
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:54,509
itself backgrounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so that's really</font>

693
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:56,969
quite cool and but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

694
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:58,559
is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not room it actually</font>

695
00:32:56,969 --> 00:33:01,079
doesn't have the permissions to move

696
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,979
itself so you can just like the annoying

697
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:10,319
user and you'll see an LED and again as

698
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:12,209
I as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stella to before because it</font>

699
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:16,319
doesn't attempt to hide itself you can

700
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:19,229
always see in the like if you LS and LSD

701
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:22,079
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and its default name when</font>

702
00:33:19,229 --> 00:33:25,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">you install it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> n later selinux some</font>

703
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:30,149
of it lives inside of the little bolder

704
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:31,529
so it's it's not that suspicious but if

705
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:32,938
you're using DVD something that doesn't

706

708
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:40,559
doesn't hatch the password for like the

except back door or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

710
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,949
and it does zuhr its variables to avoid

711
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,629
you singing strings but you can write a

712

30 line pro script or blacks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python</font>

713
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:55,540

717
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,850

00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:11,290
glowing reviews on these hacking forms

719
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:13,149
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i look at this right now and it</font>

00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,879
the sword variables for all the strings

721
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:17,609

that works is the sshd and that only

00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:24,970
works sometimes and other times it's

747
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:31,140

people been writing battle droid 3 years

00:35:53,390 --> 00:36:01,589
ridiculous so I've repeated the same

00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:05,100
slide quite a bit I've covered go

758

through the same stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> em usual in roof</font>

because as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current changes and</font>

764
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,200
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to write something that lives</font>

765
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:25,500
in diesel and breaks the entire userland

766

that it is to have 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> million if that's</font>

767
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:31,880
in your current route just in case you

768
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:34,560
install current location and they are

769
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,890
pretty powerful you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do some really</font>

770
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,500
really interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> things with them you</font>

771
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:42,150
can break exactly for example I've

772
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,700
written a proof of concept one with

773
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:46,710
myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is interesting in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> loads</font>

774
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,779
itself into memory before every program

775
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:53,040
runs and then if it finds its gone and

776
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:55,620
recreate itself and so in terms of

777
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,110
forensics you can essentially really

778
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:59,549
cetera lbs on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that trailer up and hard</font>

779
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:03,900
disk offline in there you have you found

780
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:07,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's that again nothing's or</font>

781
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,040
there's no obfuscation

782
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:19,070
in terms of life forensics when you're

783
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:24,110
actually on the box and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

784
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:27,710
do Led you can do crop maps and so every

785
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:31,100
program gone in minutes as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mask and</font>

786
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:32,630
this is what led reads bomb and the

787
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:37,430
colonel essentially is crazy violent

788
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:39,500
lists all of the other libraries and you

789
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:42,890
can obviously you can use LED but just

790
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:45,380
in case is broken you can also check the

791
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:46,460
memory rest of the functions because if

792
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,440
they're not in the place they're

793
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:52,040
supposed to be then someone's obviously

794
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:59,590
messing around your functions and which

795
00:37:52,040 --> 00:38:01,700
is sort of and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone has any samples</font>

796
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:04,940
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me on Twitter will</font>

797
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:08,149
underscore ta 0 please feed me loads and

798
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:11,150
loads of samples and I really enjoy

799
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:13,310
these I was exceedingly exceedingly

800
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,830
happy to get up around this weekend I'm

the slides I thought I'd have a really

803
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:21,770
cool discussion about the first person

804
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:25,550
to talk about but<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing works yeah</font>

805
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:28,220
freaking like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was reading someone so</font>

806
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:31,520
my tools and let it talk about earlier

807
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:34,100
there's no get up get up calm / said

808

816
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:04,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">obvious it has and</font>

817
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:05,870
and other useful tools you might want to

keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> around if you're thinking plenty of</font>

00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,810
drinks really that's so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll then break</font>

821
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,890
every other<font color="#E5E5E5"> rootkit so you can just have</font>

all those lying around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll be</font>

these it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> copy on</font>

825
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:23,029
like a USB just in case and there's also

826
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:24,530
the sash shell and it's a small study be

827
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:27,020
compiled shell it's usually used for

828
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:28,250
like recovering from a horrible

829
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,620
operating system crash because

830
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,420
everything built in it but all rights

831
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:34,250
alternatively sometimes you'll find its

00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:39,170
got all these built-in utils it's really

834
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,980
good and<font color="#CCCCCC"> umbreon v3 actually attempted</font>

835
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,940
to break some are breaking executing<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

836
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:49,820
since it doesn't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can t worry</font>

837
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:52,340
about that so questions anyone happy but

838
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:56,090
she's one of you who says I'm in rather

the panna cotta yet one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you slackers</font>

840
00:39:56,090 --> 00:40:02,510
like not paying attention Johnson as the

841
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,780
LD critical so everybody you friendly

842
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:08,030
vigilant yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what why is it still</font>

843
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,890
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> like yeah I have no idea that</font>

844
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">again this property comes back to some</font>

845
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:15,650
like mailing this conversation in the

let's include this this seems like a

848
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:22,790
good idea and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've never removed</font>

849
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:25,760
it but and I mean in all honesty if you

850
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:27,980
resist me you could pretty much just

851
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,410
create the file itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> shattered so no</font>

one gave a right to it and then go<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,370
use this I've never once seen a

855
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,370
legitimate use of
