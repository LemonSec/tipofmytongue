00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:15,039
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get going on the final</font>

2
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:16,970
final talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> here on the roof rack</font>

3
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,680
they're also talked about doing

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,150
lightning talks afters and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,220
sure whether I signed up for them

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:26,330
there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tops been listed but</font>

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:29,180
we're not quite sure the series hang

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:32,000
around think so Mikey doesn't to say

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:35,899
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the floor is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open after his talk so</font>

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,850
and this is a final repeat of today it's

11
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:41,960
not what pins from him to do our way too

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:43,760
much well<font color="#CCCCCC"> startle you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah kind of</font>

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:49,339
apologizing for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fan base I've got</font>

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:53,209
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> back apologist so here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no I know</font>

15
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:55,670
I'm kind of these days and who might and

16
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,800
so I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> back month ago workin for</font>

17
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,100
EM you are my new managed services

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,870
called concept don't look there and I'm

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,930
a graduate of stash you need I did a

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,789
degree in cosmetics and security as part

21
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,950
of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dissertation fun of your</font>

22
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,649
project I mean put it on the evolution

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,259
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dozen tanks which is kind of where</font>

24
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:16,310
this talks kind of stand from I also did

25
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:18,799
an industrial placement of

<font color="#CCCCCC">glaxosmithkline firewall engineered is</font>

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,990
complete as a bit there so I've kind of

28
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:27,860
got a little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea an industry</font>

29
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:29,810
perspective so another little plug cyber

30
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,909
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who hasn't heard of</font>

31
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,590
and fantastic opportunity for<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

32
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:36,560
looking to get into the industry and

33
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,210
there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind of drive for</font>

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,670
getting people involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a challenge</font>

35
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:44,750
so do check it out and send me the white

36
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:47,509
rattus which is the CSC and a random and

37
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,359
so quick agenda<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the last different</font>

38
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:54,799
tax motives and then prevention

39
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:57,619
education and finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> soaring so what is</font>

40
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,479
a beam<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack and typically people have</font>

41
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:01,609
this kind of misconception that people

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,640
may be done what they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> its scoop</font>

43
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:06,020
kitties and kind of performing some kind

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,348
of

45
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,420
cyber attack and quite often the case

46
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:14,569
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite often that is the case</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll similarly kind of upset person</font>

that's trying to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone or just</font>

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,900
any of those other Scottish<font color="#CCCCCC"> throw in as</font>

many<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I can and and typically that was</font>

51
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,060
all results in this car

52
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,530
here's a little bit disappointed that

53
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,779
their favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> website is gunned down</font>

54
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,850
that sound we can't on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mikado pieces</font>

55
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:45,740
that are quite following on for

<font color="#E5E5E5">Manchester so essentially d does is</font>

57
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,710
attack of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vale ability and so if we look</font>

58
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,940
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cihr mob is attacking</font>

59
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,190
availability it's one of the best and

60
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,340
potentially only in the text you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

61
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:01,520
on availability so how well we'll get to

62
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,530
that but why well<font color="#CCCCCC"> D does this massive</font>

63
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,840
loads of hopefully most of you have

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,390
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the dustiness attack so I'll</font>

65
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,050
growing and if we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this map it</font>

66
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,970
kind of shows us that over time the size

67
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:17,090
of Jesus attacks are massively growing

68
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,190
if we step back<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years these are tax</font>

69
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,959
inside terms of size wouldn't nothing

70
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,340
because it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> been really over the</font>

71
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,450
past two or three years that they've

massively catalyzed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bro but people</font>

73
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:31,160
always kind of think of Jesus tax in

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,400
terms of size and that's not always the

75
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,829
case so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the media you've</font>

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,700

except it's always kind of concentrated

and substantial<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICMP deed us on through</font>

87
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:13,209
no idea why someone's attacking through

88
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:16,099
I didn't go into and investigate it

89

similarly is a must lead us<font color="#CCCCCC"> there on the</font>

something else so historically bandwidth

106

was limited and they might been hard to

107
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,690
the tap because obviously getting the

108
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,310
bandage was harder and also defending

109
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,350
it's harder to get the bandwidth and

110
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,020
stove actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> mitigating was much</font>

111
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,000
harder but they were also attacks on

115
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,690
lack of dedicated service providers and

116
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:24,170
a lack of dedicated and eNOS mitigations

117
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,880
hardware and it wasn't really until 2006

118
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,410
that is outlawed so there was a number

<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cases before where people who were</font>

out at the back of them and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three that I chose follow the</font>

research that I did for my money in

project so starting off at the top

134
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,870
you've got a volumetric attacks these

135
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,700
are the bandwidth bastes attacks this in

which everyone and mostly is loaded<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

200

can do a reflection<font color="#E5E5E5"> or we can turn up</font>

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,880
one step further and add application

209
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:17,920
lookups and so you can send the DNS

210
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:20,020
request to the dns server and ask for

211

everything it potentially has about<font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

and hosts now sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> out from that is</font>

213
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:26,260
quite a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> request but quite commonly</font>

214
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,890
you'll get quite a big request back and

215
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:33,510
so the request and be a much smaller

216
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:37,000
than doing the respective response

similarly with<font color="#CCCCCC"> AGP there is the modest</font>

220
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,410
and i have not found any documentation

221
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,570
as to why don't you p support from on

222
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,819
this command if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> has no ideas let</font>

223
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:54,850
me know and but essentially it allows

224
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,770
you to send in really small request an

225
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,160
interview server and get a huge response

226
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,870
and return so that's a little table that

227
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,870
shows you the potential application

228

factors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dean xfinity TV and fell in</font>

common and charging less<font color="#CCCCCC"> DP or no</font>

230
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:19,340
increasing in size interviews so what's

231
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,680
the idea what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> volumetric attacks well</font>

232
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,290
primarily its bandwidth saturation we

233
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,660
can flip the<font color="#CCCCCC"> targets so that and no</font>

234
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,280
legitimate traffic will get through with

235
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,550
what this is most commonly what we're

236
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:35,480
trying to do but also a going conflict

237
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:37,069
on its edge and a bit of crafting we can

238
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,890
work it so that we can result in

239
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,870
resource<font color="#CCCCCC"> dilation and that's so that's</font>

240
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">where by we we target the targets</font>

241
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:48,140
infrastructure such that the target is

242
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:50,329
south and can't deal with legitimate

243
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,400
traffic so for example if we cleverly

244
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,130
crap requests we can result in hundreds

245
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,699
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU time their utilization at which</font>

246
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:03,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">point no requests are gonna be accepted</font>

247
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:05,480
so those that have to kind of scenarios

248
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,780
that we can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> push for more</font>

249
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,270
attacking so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> really simple</font>

250
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,069
if we can generate more traffic than the

251
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,530
fact that take then it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in</font>

252
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,570
denial of service and that's typically

253
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:20,420
what people use an overrun can get

254
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:26,900
enough with online dog then you can take

255
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:29,209
my service there's also a commonly

256
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,030
increase in tactical smokescreen attack

257
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:35,510
and that's where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the volumetric</font>

258
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,970
attack as part of a much larger side of

259
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:40,460
attack so the volumetric attack actually

260
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,020
kinda<font color="#E5E5E5"> max is a smokescreen and so while</font>

261
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,270
the sock is literally running around

262
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,689
panicking that all services are offline

263
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:49,490
and nothing's working and in through the

264
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,410
back doors actual cyber attackers can

265
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,920
get straight in and no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> even realizes</font>

266
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,930
that attacked taking place and and so

267
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,099
there's been quite a few instances in

268
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the news where this has actually</font>

275
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,550
it doesn't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> really much to identify</font>

276
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:24,440
shoot gulps of traffic potentially if

277
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,729
they're spread out and then it might be

278
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,399
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more difficult to these</font>

279
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:31,190
texts and but with the correct

280
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,860
mitigation it can easily be detected and

281
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,240
the traffic can be redirected<font color="#E5E5E5"> as planned</font>

kind of varies between the bounds of

it's a shame really because it's quite

326
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,810
useful attack and so it's kind of a

collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different attacks the</font>

00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,030
there's different kind of scenarios the

knapper and and essentially all you'll

333
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,790
do is you'll send and share amounts of

334
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,460
traffic you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not keeping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> track of the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">tcp connection state and so again it</font>

336
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,530
kind of and they're pushing the boundary

337
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">between volumetric and and protocol</font>

338

it in memory and you've progressed again

so the memory used to us up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and</font>

up and up and eventually very exhausting

354
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,220
alternatively you've got your

355
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,469
application tax so these actually attack

356
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,270
the application protocols themselves

into the request services<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

drop the volume at increasing

<font color="#E5E5E5">before kind of doing any research for my</font>

sure exactly what I deal with it but I

well there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go so quick summary not</font>

all these attacks to say understand the

552
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:42,600
and commonly you might get an extortion

perform that<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead us is probably fairly</font>

557
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,409
is that just

558
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:58,649
so never<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay and give in to those</font>

559
00:24:54,410 --> 00:25:00,510
professors so this was kind of the

had some clever and technique not really

593
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,439
that would likely be the reason

00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:53,850
potentially I just wasn't sure if maybe

595
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,580
there was some clever way that they were

617
00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:00,330
always-on solutions so that if you do

<font color="#CCCCCC">MCD doesn't act on it you can then push</font>

the redirect traffic off to a classical

621
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,690
becomes at home in the house making you

644
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:31,600
information about it top and there's

645
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,670
kind of different infographics that kind

646
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,770
of show roughly what they're doing but

647
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:37,660
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very unclear kind of how about how</font>

648
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,120
they're going about doing it and that

649
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,460
might be a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> target to kind of</font>

650
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,760
explore down to and work out what it is

651
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,890
exactly doing mr. and one of the things

652
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I've seen working posting could</font>

make

00:30:19,120 --> 00:31:00,379
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's cheating yeah yeah you just</font>

655
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,780
looking snitch leave that single point

656
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:05,450
failure doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many kind of</font>

00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,580
active standby routes or switches and

658
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,900
all games that you pay for there's

659
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">always going to be one single point of</font>

660
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,440
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's that maxed out</font>

661
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,020
doesn't matter if it's the target all

662
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,680
target and everyone else and I've dude

663
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:21,950
us it's going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> place drop tank</font>

665
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,460
yeah

666
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:43,640
yeah so AWS have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool ways</font>

667
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:45,229
and how they can rearrange traffic and

668
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,690
also how they move about servers as well

669
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,700
so they have instances that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> koto</font>

670
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:52,159
Kate<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the servers so that if they</font>

671
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,529
do see attacks i think really take this

672
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,350
instance put over here so that it's only

673
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the target is getting attacked and</font>

674
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:05,389
that's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways that they</font>

675
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:07,399
mitigate it if ass given that you've got

00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:09,168
mitigation companies you know Sandra

00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:14,899
levels figurations varies how do you

679
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,510

00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:19,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is there is a big note that you know</font>

681
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:22,820
is a stand with the people working<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

682
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,320
all so it's over<font color="#CCCCCC"> standards no and that</font>

683
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:28,549
always kind of printed the passion<font color="#CCCCCC"> Heidi</font>

685
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:32,899
attached as such you can always build it

686
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:36,049
in a test that environment and see if it

687
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:37,879
holds out and but otherwise you know no

688
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:40,039
company in their right mind is gonna

689
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,470
quite happily go along but it's not a

are they indicate some potential attack

00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:42,090
and off the top of their heads in two

709
