00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:23,870
just about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the taxable</font>

151
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:28,490
some sort of attachment always a

152
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:31,350
microsoft office excel spreadsheet

153
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:34,089
so easily

154
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:36,810
some office key techniques that other

155
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:36,810
other games

156
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:47,660
it's I have to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's reasonably</font>

157
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:49,400
simple and it's effective

158
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,550
despite the fact that it's been going on

159
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,060
since the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dawn of the Internet email it</font>

160
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,060
still works

161
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:12,830
so speaking of a great edge beyond the

162
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:12,830
concept at its<font color="#E5E5E5"> center point beautiful</font>

163
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:22,540
once that package is installed on to a

164
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,540
user system that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> semaine becomes</font>

168
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:43,089
instance to one of their affiliates

169
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,469
fairly sophisticated

170
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:58,670
set the

171
00:11:53,180 --> 00:12:02,270
so they essentially run like any other

172
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:05,870
software services organization they log

173
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,990
bugs they fix folks attract users of

174
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,990
there

175
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:23,920
so once<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens and someone was</font>

176
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:29,230
unlucky enough to be a victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> dried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font>

177
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:32,128
installer they have a system of what

178
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:35,819
they call web injects that will then

179
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:42,200
either metal or man in the browser

180
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:45,130
victim so once this happens

181
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,130
the series

182
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,130

186
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:08,420
URLs then bot knows to intercept all to

187
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:11,089
the browser redirect it to the site of

193
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:32,570
the user is usually then just punted or

194
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:37,240
shunted thinking of credentials and

195

ever so in doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they've created a</font>

00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,839
system where the person on the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

226
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:33,700
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one instance so the top layer</font>

227
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:37,020
infrastructure so again the person that

228
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:40,770
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to sit at a box at a terminal</font>

229
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,770
they're going to be behind

230
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:53,970
you in full crew<font color="#E5E5E5"> poster so if somebody</font>

231
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:57,119
like your<font color="#CCCCCC"> robe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eh just</font>

232
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,569
nearly impossible to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> at and then</font>

233
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,569
later right

234
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:05,978
so the secret structure is set up a

235
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:08,219
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit like this you have your</font>

237
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,519
sufficiently now they unfortunately

238
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:15,059
clicked on the attachment that run the

239
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,059
attachment

240
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:24,109
so the attachment will call out and they

241
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:26,570
will download the Driving's executable

242
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,580
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that download site also</font>

243
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:35,600
then becomes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of command</font>

244
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:40,540
control which will then VPN connection

245
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,850
to the next layer so that's one more

246
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,219
the attacker

247
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:50,050
makes extremely difficult even<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

248
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:52,529
stage to then start identifying where

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,529
the command

250
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,030
may be compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> host just randomly</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">at this point</font>

253
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,730
oh sure sitting between that

254
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:23,030
now

255
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:23,030
this is one model in some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

256
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:30,000
more complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> and difficult to start</font>

257
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,000
tracking that

258
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:36,850
so

259
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,850
after all that long preamble

260
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:53,690
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internodes every day every day using</font>

262
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,830
suppose

263
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,830
yes

264
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:07,380
he's really particularly sophisticated

265
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:09,539
in terms of fishing so any one of you it

266
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,770
holds the social engineering tool kit

267
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:18,590
far better examples

268
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:20,780
these are all perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> in jail so this is</font>

269
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:28,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">a common one you've received some sort</font>

of an order details you customize Oh

271
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:35,080
every day people would go I am an

272
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,080
ordered a talking

273
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:52,010
and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take anything to because</font>

274
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,010
humans are naturally curious and

275
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,540
obviously something because it

276
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,428
you

277
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,429
even simpler

278
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:10,610
this one is showing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's well I</font>

279
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,760
guess the newest builder notes 40 grand

280
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:16,459
that's what large so whoever got this is

281
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,440
obviously going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

again

286
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,450
so the next physical 1 i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

in that they use live links than actual

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,510
redirect to the real Amazon site so if

you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at this even if you're</font>

makes it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more believable still</font>

297
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,549
there's the attachment and it's an

impressive-looking attachment

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:42,410

323

they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the commentary sure</font>

this

what you will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's for defender</font>

347
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:17,419
and exercise in frustration what they

348
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:22,980
have done is named every very variable

349
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:26,110
and every function using<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes when</font>

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,120
I want to know what I you peeled open

353
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,420
order to find out with you guys I need

354
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,409
to know that Lionel's a function and

355
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,410
returns values best upon

356
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:56,090
it's just it's insanely frustrating so

357
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:06,740
if you have time then decrease the show

358
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:06,740
and relative the butter or you can lose

359
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:15,259
here

360
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:23,270
despite the fact that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

so I sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> short-circuiting the logic</font>

366
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:53,179
even narrow down what it is the prompt

00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:57,610
you do they even if you're lazy

368
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:57,610
sometimes think i am is just right<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

369

and what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> end up getting</font>

370
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:15,139
so cool when an executable call

they also do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that a lot</font>

and so on the flip side of this just

391

gives you something to look for in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

395
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:44,780
if you know what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for a</font>

that I didn't talk was that I work in a
