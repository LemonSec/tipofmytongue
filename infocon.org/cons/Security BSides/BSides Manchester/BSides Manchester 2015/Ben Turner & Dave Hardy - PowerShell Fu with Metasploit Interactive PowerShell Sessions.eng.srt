41
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,988
of the beauties of PowerShell is this an

42
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,790
object-oriented language so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

43
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,580
basically incorporate incorporate any

44
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:57,600
the.net objects and use it basically as

45
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:00,269
you will on man line uses parameters

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,799
that saw a variable base so everything

47
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,660
is kept within memory so if you write

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,180
which are variable i gets reuse you can

49
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,530
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in code and you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> background</font>

starting with white server 2012

56
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,330
introduced what was called a car

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,530
installation where there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no GUI and</font>

58
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,330
pretty much the only way to interact

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the operating system apart from the</font>

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,959
remote access tools like outside

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:42,670
whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was PowerShell so they</font>

put started to pull their eggs in one

63
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:49,500
basket way back in 2012 07 2012 but now

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,910
we would serve at 2016 coming along

65
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,890
basically the default build the server

66
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,420
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be no good there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

67
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,029
be only PowerShell well there is the

68
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:02,290
option to add it back in what girls use

69
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">gooeys anyway so and then the windows</font>

70
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,549
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft are already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got banging on</font>

71
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,739
about this new thing called nano server

72
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:15,489
which is like it's just enough operating

73
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:18,760
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup or I think they're mainly</font>

74
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:20,918
pitching it over web but also in the

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,419
data center in the cloud and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

76
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,120
only managed at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment with</font>

77
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:27,609
powershell and the DSC which is there

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,389
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull picked up chef type</font>

79
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,669
implementation

80
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:34,900
which allows configuration from a

81
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:37,270
low-flying sauce and their pumpkin so

82
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,770
much into these new operating systems of

83
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,120
the way they're actually managed they've

84
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,698
brought a new level of partial a partial

85
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,020
five they've been books played around

86
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:48,879
with the new power shell fire with

87
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:53,099
windows 10 a lot of functionality in

88
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,099
Windows 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also based on powershell</font>

89
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:59,349
so come shelves now like Microsoft's

90
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:01,870
like bash almost the Linux it's the core

91
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:05,378
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating system previously like</font>

92
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Windows was a GUI with some tools in the</font>

93
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:10,419
background now its power shell with some

94
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,490
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> api's and everything else through</font>

95
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:14,258
powershell so they kind of put all their

96
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:21,009
eggs in one basket and moving towards

97
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:23,800
wipe our shells involved so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

98
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:25,569
we invested use<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell so alone</font>

99
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,939
taking over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a quick summary of</font>

100
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,589
a few tools that pretty much awesome to

101
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:31,539
use in Paris after they invoke

102
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:34,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">commandment basically you can download</font>

103
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:36,789
honest man and supply get to be

104
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">passwords</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and mini cat the want to</font>

105
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:40,479
highlight involves<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk</font>

106
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,279
about how every crumb but basically the

107
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,318
whole framework of tools just out there

108
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:49,689
brilliant powerful scripture import to a

109
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:52,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Harrison them probably could handle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

110
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:57,039
their company<font color="#CCCCCC"> Empire vine and I will</font>

111
00:05:52,750 --> 00:06:02,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">shell guys across tools guys really</font>

112
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:05,169
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably no longer than a year so</font>

113
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:07,149
what we have before a mess for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so</font>

114
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:10,719
when you get session<font color="#CCCCCC"> on mass boy how</font>

115
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:12,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">could you use PowerShell nor my host so</font>

116
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:14,110
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you couldn't really</font>

117
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:16,120
there was a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scripts in there</font>

118
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,080
that allowing for X cute one-liners or

119
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,900
one script and

120
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,270
see the output slowly wasn't quite

121
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,159
intuitive and nothing was preserved

122
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,258
within<font color="#CCCCCC"> script so if you want to import</font>

123
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:28,639
module and running multiple functions

124
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:30,650
within that module you just couldn't do

125
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,039
it yea after in one module at a time do

126
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,750
we want it so this is so people bit of a

127
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,460
background so everything we've done with

128
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,169
tests on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk scenario so it's</font>

129
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,729
quite a quality environment everything's

130
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,650
gone through fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> order that's got a B</font>

131
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:45,409
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it everything goes through a proxy</font>

132
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,419
with the user based authentication so it

133
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:49,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">really simulate a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real-world attack so</font>

134
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:53,539
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show me that give you a bit</font>

135
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:55,009
of a concept so the old way so this is

136
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,620
the way you said currently have to run

137
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,690
if you want to run basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell</font>

138
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyhow so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm assuming you all know</font>

139
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,050
how to get a powerful interpreter

140
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,508
sessions so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to basically go</font>

141
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,330
from there on so as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

142
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,639
to interpret sessions some of you a

143
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,758
consummate our these are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

144
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,949
behind of the name this is me running a

145
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,659
single script on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host you can have</font>

146
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,930
to append each strip the function<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

147
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:23,029
you want to call and then it goes and it

148
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,310
uploads it by<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kbytes cuz there's a</font>

149
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:26,750
limit on the command prompt and then it

150
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,610
comes back and it comes it all into a

151
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,710
script and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have one sorry</font>

152
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,090
Geppetto fire starting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> second and</font>

153
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,039
then you can output it so that's just an

154
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:37,219
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> k used to be able to run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

155
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,990
its<font color="#CCCCCC"> origins look that easy try that hard</font>

156
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:41,479
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a great truth and that's not</font>

157
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,039
really how power our shows view for

158
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,310
retaining scripts<font color="#E5E5E5"> your claims that</font>

159
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,330
between

160
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:52,230
function yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to say</font>

161
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this retaining variables inside of</font>

162
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,410
the powershell for Disease one of the

163
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,900
big things that you probably don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

164
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,030
about is when you type how shall the exe

165
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,409
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you run some stuff and in plex of</font>

166
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,659
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and create some variables</font>

167
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,170
and then close that and then reopen it

168
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,100
again those daily existence they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone</font>

169
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,070
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've been saying about</font>

170
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,810
the fact that you need to preserve as a

171
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,760
pen tester we probably want to preserve

172
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,460
variables or preserve arounds or what

173
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">over text files or whatever that were</font>

174
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,710
generated inside the session and now

175
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,900
yeah so so you've gone there well this

176
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,150
video runs this is power view which is a

177
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,880
bit of a larger script initially ran get

178
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,890
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a fairly small screen as you</font>

179
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,559
can see it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a shitload longer</font>

180
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,449
basically and there's a lot more scripts

181
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,429
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> planets that you want to use a power</font>

182
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,290
youth function brother<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

183
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:42,150
just getting the users user counselor

184
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:44,189
domain but you might now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in another</font>

185
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,840
function so it just doesn't work how do

186
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,110
you want to be able to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you want</font>

187
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just run all the functions all in one</font>

188
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,310
again you know I work for you all this

189
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:56,280
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is another one power up but</font>

190
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,140
again more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> some guys you want very</font>

191
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,910
poor check yet their pen game overall

192
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,949
checks function to the script and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

193
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,740
run it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you can see it takes ages</font>

194
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,060
this is like a really big script<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

195
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,130
just wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of show you'll give</font>

196
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:13,529
you concept of what it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> before going</font>

197
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:15,779
with what we came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with still going</font>

198
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:17,579
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> this over the incident I just</font>

199
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:38,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to represent vulnerable services</font>

200
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:40,819
I'll go to bed so a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> back background</font>

201
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:42,749
yeah this is what this was born<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

202
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:44,550
letting should be up these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things called</font>

203
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,980
clinic days were some of us society

204
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,378
presentable smaller versions of what

205
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,670
we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and we have one</font>

206
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:55,199
powershell and I was sliding apparently

207
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,910
and we had some issues that to say the

208
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,410
least I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledged</font>

209
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,649
or like if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what it was like</font>

210
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,999
hopefully think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's quite work and we</font>

211
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:05,279
haven't up need for getting these

212
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:07,319
thinnies strips<font color="#CCCCCC"> powers white and power</font>

213
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,420
all the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the power tools and</font>

214
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:11,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">this kind of thing on to the victim box</font>

215
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,920
and I kind of went away and i thought

216
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:15,660
i'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> achieve this like scripted</font>

217
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,729
basic website<font color="#E5E5E5"> repeated all that it</font>

218
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,160
happens every time the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've always</font>

219
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,889
got this tool set where we white and we

220
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,569
know how to work so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came up with some</font>

221
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:29,430
house shell scripts again that used a

222
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:31,319
tool that was probably release what

223
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,109
about a year ago at Derek on faulty

224
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:37,229
nothing but Powell cap which is neck

225
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen in PowerShell antelope and I can</font>

226
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,750
it rare these scripts up to use the

227
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:45,870
power cat session and embodied scripts

228
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,670
from the actual get home sites of pals

229
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,269
fighting these these are the guys and

230
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:52,740
then actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull them into memory</font>

231
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:54,689
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> make things a whole lot simpler</font>

232
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,699
and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier for us as pen testers</font>

233
00:10:54,689 --> 00:11:00,089
to be a rather largest room dear strips

234
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:01,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">boomin all the tools are there which is</font>

235
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:04,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">fantastic because we never had</font>

236
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,800
for but then blends it well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

237
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,920
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> room that's why and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's where</font>

238
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:15,560
our real so trials and tribulations

239
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:19,729
start with this old thing this is what's

240
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,739
new so yeah basically interactive

241
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,200
powershell sessions in mass<font color="#E5E5E5"> going so</font>

242
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just a payload it's naturally a</font>

243
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,610
help you session type so you have to

244
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,589
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole command prompt session</font>

245
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,380
type to pay and you perish our session

246
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,180
so that you have to run now great post

247
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,460
module to go with it not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just any of the</font>

248
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,370
any liquor existing programs will<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

249
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">with it and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same session type and</font>

250
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,750
this is the kind of quick demo what it

251
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,480
gives you basically it's like an older

252
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,570
box experiences i call it so when you

253
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,550
pop the<font color="#E5E5E5"> powershell shall that's like it</font>

254
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,350
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> our shell apart from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its not</font>

255
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,089
blue and white is black and<font color="#CCCCCC"> white well</font>

256
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,730
can we play like we change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the covering</font>

257
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:01,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">interview bus oh you that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like what</font>

258
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,840
have you running it so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see there</font>

259
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,420
what comes up on the screen is what you

260
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,940
get when you a pawn shop<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

261
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,329
essentially what you'll can either show

262
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,520
you a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than I just want to add</font>

263
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:16,400
that this isn't a trivial task I don't

264
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:20,329
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone driving in temescal is an</font>

265
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:23,930
absolute bitch the coding that you have

266
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:26,000
follow at all processes and everything

267
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,530
it just takes forever<font color="#E5E5E5"> we managed to get</font>

268
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,930
six<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oppresses actually fully</font>

269
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,819
approve if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up I think one of</font>

270
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,459
the guys who's helped massively me cause

271
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:38,240
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> their and a few other guys I'm sure</font>

272
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,830
on here hoping 78 comments one of the

273
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,780
payload went through just to get proof

274
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,720
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see the kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or later when</font>

275
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:47,089
producer just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get this infamous point</font>

276
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,870
the only do it in like six weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it</font>

277
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:54,650
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad time and when I HD r you</font>

278
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:57,500
talk to him for helping a lot as well so

279
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,630
yeah so how's would put sir that's for

280
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,000
nickels

281
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:05,730
access granted so we shouldn't

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,510
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> in memory there's no</font>

283
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,810
description whatsoever so it's

284
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:15,160
completely offset state so unless you

285
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:16,599
decide to save the file to disk the rest

286
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,790
of it is completely invisible to

287
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,410
antivirus anything to do in there is

288
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:25,270
completely safe to be true the flight

289
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">info many cats directly onto a host of</font>

290
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:30,579
the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll just in mcafee less</font>

291
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,890
than well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go out notes get a little</font>

292
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,050
bit anything that were you<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

293
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,340
defender and that will touch this all

294
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:42,579
there is a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop Windows Defender</font>

295
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:44,380
detective this so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new way so</font>

296
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,510
again we'll start on the same process

297
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:52,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">will have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public sessions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raining pretty</font>

298
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:54,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">firewall retaining the session just well</font>

299
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,840
this is really there are multiple ways

300
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:59,500
to deploy these payloads to stay out

301
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,360
palos so it's not an exploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do it a</font>

302
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,920
different way<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ben does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> appear psexec</font>

303
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I do it with maybe like a web</font>

304
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,229
browser and get the Victorian that way

305
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:11,110
up there's multiple ways to get the

306
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:13,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">cheapy so we've the phone is flying</font>

307
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,890
basically through a firewall we can't

308
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,439
get to indirectly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to now to</font>

309
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">come interpret session we upgrade that</font>

310
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,190
session to a parish<font color="#E5E5E5"> shelter we can do</font>

311
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,630
all that fun stuff so one way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

312
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,060
the payload inject option so that

313
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:28,330
basically injects<font color="#E5E5E5"> why the pale if you</font>

314
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:30,040
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into memory directly and that's</font>

315
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,990
to perform with doing and so I'm running

316
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">a buying shell now against the host</font>

317
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,560
using port forwarding with the mats

318
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,069
Lloyd they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> alike on ack suppose</font>

319
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,810
you added a<font color="#CCCCCC"> root and this is the load</font>

320
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,360
module function so the load module bit

321
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,520
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this goes and grabs loaded two</font>

322
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,050
scripts off the internet

323
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> commandments that you want to run</font>

324
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,069
and it goes and directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> into memory</font>

325
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,020
using the system net that web client

326
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a parish out so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of how</font>

327
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,579
you weaponize the shell you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

328
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,170
get normal powershell session<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

329
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,600
interactive that's the first really cool

330
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,729
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay secondly is that it goes and</font>

331
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,930
downloads all these basic your anything

332
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,640
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> over to your blazing great</font>

start racking off your<font color="#CCCCCC"> power you command</font>

336

337
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:16,530
great stuff that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use you can</font>

344
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,000
there we go we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> an interactive</font>

345
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,470
parish or setting like command prompt

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's purely PowerShell everything's</font>

347
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,160
retain all the session variables

348
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,960
everything is purely in there and all

349
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,790
the functions that we've loaded well now

350
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can just run straight off the bat so</font>

353
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,000
that we were loaded to get you could be

354

password so<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally just running it</font>

355
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,900
knows about the wall you can run it like

that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> command line get back instantly</font>

357
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,220
there's no waiting around there's no

waiting on for hours see how quickly

<font color="#CCCCCC">PowerShell scripts that are out there</font>

373

are loads of cool ones and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

374
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:41,129
showing you how you can use them easily

375
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:42,989
biomass procession some of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

376
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:44,879
been quite interesting with quality

377
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:46,229
initiatives more about how i can run

378
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,970
stuff in the background so when you get

379
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:49,199
one session if you've run something on

380
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,479
the command line while you do normally

381
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,118
it sort of users of that session and a

382
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:56,579
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this stuff like in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your bed so I</font>

383
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:58,589
don't about responder basically it's a

384
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:01,199
netbios spoofing the tool that allows

385
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:03,899
you to gather the hashes off a network

386
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,279
and when you're often again through a

387
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,349
firewall you know on the home if you

388
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,819
want to run stuff like that but also you

389
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:10,559
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run it the background if you</font>

390
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,209
don't want to see everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> as comes</font>

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,309
back you<font color="#E5E5E5"> re printer two hours come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

392
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,100
and get hashes also you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be wanted</font>

393
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:20,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run under command so as this place to</font>

394
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:22,529
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> jobs is PS job in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell it's a</font>

395
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,209
great look function basically just runs

396
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:25,980
like screen on linux so you can just

397
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,350
basically start a new session give it

398
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,649
glamour and it'll just run to sit there

399
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:32,699
pudding<font color="#E5E5E5"> go get the output periodically</font>

400
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:36,689
so that we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works really well</font>

401
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,460
so example if you're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> invade very</font>

402
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,519
similar to responder<font color="#E5E5E5"> just leave it</font>

403
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:44,129
running so when they're just mention

404
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,240
about stark<font color="#CCCCCC"> jobs is mentioned something</font>

405
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:48,678
else

406
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,210
start jobs actually starts a new power

407
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,730
shell process so if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> in touch</font>

408
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">mode</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you like to partial VX</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seizure of</font>

409
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:58,190
multiples<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you start with in too</font>

410
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,309
many jobs the victim box might get a bit

411
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,809
stressed or a bit slow or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

412
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:04,970
what all of the scripts might take all

413
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:07,070
the results is on might go loop in a

414
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,649
loop and basically breaker box so you

415
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,389
need to be careful how many do what just

416
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:13,248
beware and turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> up selfie you wanna be</font>

417
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:15,320
a father loves you if someone is quite

418
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:18,919
savvy<font color="#E5E5E5"> checks the process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in 10s</font>

419
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">come to me in look a bit dodgy other</font>

420
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:23,629
words get around that so again so this

421
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">is me is going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got</font>

422
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:26,269
loads of demos so I just thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

423
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:28,909
print screen so again you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

424
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:30,470
session and basically i uploaded in bay

425
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:33,259
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not doing any memory</font>

426
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:35,360
following so you're gloating day to the

427
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:37,249
house star<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript locked and then</font>

428
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,629
give it a ps1 file and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically just</font>

429
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:43,759
sits there running as you can see we are

430
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:45,559
glad we have modified in vain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run as</font>

431
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,669
a function so you can actually import it

432
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:51,529
into it into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> powershell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will shell</font>

433
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit shell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've developed it does</font>

434
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:55,159
work that way also yes some people write

435
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:58,490
scripts that as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you load them at</font>

436
00:18:55,159 --> 00:19:00,110
runs where that isn't how you want it if

437
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this because obviously if you're</font>

438
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,219
important

439
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,840
that's going to scream shell so you want

440
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,150
it the way they writing functions like

441
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,260
most of them in powerschool so like in

442
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,730
between recaps you loaded into memory

443
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,890
and when you want to run it you run the

444
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,860
function invoke invoke all checks or

445
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,510
mini capsule or whatever so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in very</font>

446
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,969
wouldn't mean quite like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave</font>

447
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:22,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">just change it and basically works like</font>

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,210
limitations of the faculty switch sides

452

of the session<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got a copy paste</font>

458
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:05,730
don't like pipeline but you can I stuff

459
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:07,530
out to another place one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I</font>

460
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,750
like to do to get past antivirus when I

00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,330
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually drop stuff on a box i'll</font>

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,920
get it to it is used<font color="#E5E5E5"> new PS drive which</font>

463
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,830
is like nothing to drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> you through</font>

you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> an answer by student see inside</font>

471
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,430
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can basically get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorted evil</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah sorry go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the get job so</font>

475
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,610
again I'll just run<font color="#E5E5E5"> that job to get a</font>

476
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,740

477
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:54,590
it'll all be listed there to receive the

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,750
output<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that job and just type sort</font>

479

of cheap dominantly and the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

480
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:01,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">job so again so that's me running advice</font>

481
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,810
proofing on on the network it's going

back saying advice witness<font color="#CCCCCC"> disabled</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever for their houses but you look</font>

484
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:10,190
really long enough and you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

485
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,330
half so again I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not here to talk about</font>

486
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,680
what the strip does that the

487
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,110
functionality you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it within</font>

488
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,060
hours you can bring it as a job

489
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">separately they're running wake the</font>

490
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,690
vehicle<font color="#CCCCCC"> ashes take it back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

491
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:25,850
doesn't interact it doesn't mess up your

492
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:29,900
session essentially a little bit about

493
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:31,429
the code so it seems like it's a lot for

494
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,350
actually because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> oil powder</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

495
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:35,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">is really not kidding you know you can</font>

496
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:38,409
use all the dotnet objects to create or

497
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">teach of defiance and ssl streams and</font>

498
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:42,640
basically there's two pages<font color="#E5E5E5"> of code here</font>

499
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would work for you and go for it all</font>

500
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,210
essentially the topic and if you're in a

501
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,280
proxy away environment when you go to

502
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,450
download the modules you want to make

503
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,580
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the credentials of</font>

504
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,140
that login user and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

505
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,560
supply them because if you want to know

506
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,470
that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's basically the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

507
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:03,440
function of the top powerful I'm pretty

508
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,180
 with names and<font color="#E5E5E5"> demo why I or the</font>

509
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,740
pattern but it's kind of stopped now

510
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:13,750
it's so obvious thing about

511
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:18,180
you see great over very imaginative at

512
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,180
one of the hell would survive the power

513
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:25,060
so when we first create this it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

514
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,060
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well they didn't have binding</font>

515
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:30,370
our reverse Robin ssl aware but when we

516
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,740
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into mastoid HC way I was really</font>

517
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:35,320
good but it's all in clear text HTTP

518
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lorana okay all in venice's have my</font>

519
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">pendulum and your own internet as a vine</font>

520
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:42,250
that one traversed<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we'll go and</font>

521
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,290
find that and so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of how to</font>

522
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:49,480
spawn into this so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basis you can</font>

523
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a buying shelter or this one</font>

524
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,070
thing we want to do in the future is a

525
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:56,260
risk HTTP which again I'll come<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to in</font>

526
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,960
a bit but that's the first bit of 7 line

527
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,460
of code as you can see it's not very

528
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,640
very clever grip if it's clever

529
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:05,740
godlessness its roots<font color="#CCCCCC"> profit or loss but</font>

530
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going I'm going enough we must</font>

531
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:11,110
up together and I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the download</font>

532
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,660
that's down the cradle survey stakes

533
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:16,389
proxy potential<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes down as module that</font>

541
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,959
as you can see quite at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top twenty</font>

542
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:38,139
thousand k bikes now and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started like</font>

543
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,610
tonight 255 and we found loads of<font color="#E5E5E5"> errors</font>

544
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:43,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">just because when we try to upload a</font>

545
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,179
module which again will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to an</font>

546
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,179

00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:50,130
bites at a time and I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> took absolute</font>

age and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet dying what so Elliot</font>

549
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,470
increase well I ball round when I

550
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:59,190
started trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop a script sons</font>

551
00:23:54,470 --> 00:24:00,720
was great so we were that you are well

552
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:02,190
it won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a workout I would been</font>

553
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,650
struggling with this and he looked out

554
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:07,650
for like three minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago fits this you</font>

00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:13,590
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Deaf it's this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then he</font>

556
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:15,240
worked but essentially everything you

557
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,970
type in is plating it to invoke

558
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,860
expression in PowerShell and his wife is

559
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">out shrink to get the response back in</font>

560
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:26,129
most aspects so I suppose there are some

561
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:29,040
limitations about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much light in one</font>

562
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,780
line like that so that when we found

563
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,210
many invitations at all with it and if

564
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:36,649
you do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just upload the whole script</font>

565
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,650
as a function and do

566
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:48,030
so we've done some extra stuff as well

567
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,799
this top line 64-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> powershell sessions</font>

568
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:53,480
that was another one of these why the

569
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,530
hell<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this thing they'll work several</font>

570
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">well I used to be able to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

571
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,370
every time and he had loads of trouble

572
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I'm like what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and then we</font>

573
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:04,290
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked out what it was because</font>

574
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,510
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way mascot actually deployed it's</font>

575
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:09,149
a payload at the end of the day the way

576
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:11,429
it works is it uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> the command function</font>

577
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:14,040
and it actually deploys it using a

578
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:16,500
bloody to pick 32-bit piece of code so

579
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,928
it was deploying our 64-bit powershell

580
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,240
session into a 32-bit process<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

581
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:23,040
didn't work so once we works on that

582
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:27,480
another liable moment we decided to

583
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,950
develop specific session which gave us

584
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,049
completely focused on one thing are they

585
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,820
is normally ordinary that wouldn't

586
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:34,860
matter however when you want to get

587
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,960
password out of lsat which is really the

588
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,760
64-bit process you kind of screwed if

589
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,500
you're only 32 the Christmas just<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

590
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,929
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so that would boil everything</font>

591
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,780
else works except when you want to get

592
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:47,669
into a 64-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> process when he was</font>

running a 32-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows machine you but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are great to meet growing up because</font>

595
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,929
every time yes you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that work work</font>

596
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,870
work so this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quite a</font>

597
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:59,280
bit chosen is kind of happened HT was

598
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:01,049
out again with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it when we try to get</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mask boy but all it doesn't look</font>

600

<font color="#CCCCCC">like it's a big thing it just took a</font>

601
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,620
little while to get it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wall</font>

00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">you stare up for hours and hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

603
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,320
just don't see anything plastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> swallow</font>

604
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">those moments</font>

605
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">but like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier when I codes</font>

606
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:18,360
when you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> made this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen because we</font>

607
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:20,309
need to determine I Benjamin should

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:27,080
we've done an ssl spot so it's

<font color="#CCCCCC">that's good and still is it so the</font>

611
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,320
moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you so if you initially employ</font>

612
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,840
this without using<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interpretive</font>

613
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,720
session and you do reverse due to pain

614
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,918
that's not proxy aware so it won't want

615

to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your shell if you're in a proxy</font>

out without going through Fox are you

619
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,389
happy but if not you can't at the moment

620
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:55,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we're working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that I can get it</font>

621
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:57,750
working just fine that's what the load

622
00:26:55,409 --> 00:27:00,419
script is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that caused me</font>

623
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:03,600
other's hair and be greater that's more

624

<font color="#E5E5E5">of a so you're in you've got a section</font>

625
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,570
you've got a script that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

626
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:13,049
load locally so maybe the hopes doesn't

627
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,908
have any ports open useful so you can

628
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:17,460
use a local web server there's no

629
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:19,440
internet access the load script is like

630
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:23,039
hopes module almost in a way that you

631
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">can use the strip to load your power</font>

637
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:42,340
like some reasons a long time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

638
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,429
really know why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess last weekend CT</font>

639
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,860
eight years work night but I think that

640
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:50,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's their that sort of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">big power function LTR allows you to do</font>

642
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,030
a lot more in a library locks down

643
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:57,580
environment yeah lets you load it from

644
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,320
either file on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> host or give it an</font>

older so do you fight I have a pen<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

646
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">folded back no matter that day we want</font>

647
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,689
powershell scripts in once you got

648
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:06,370
session this<font color="#E5E5E5"> power show you can say</font>

649
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,790
right hello doll that script in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

650
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:11,320
folder then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll just clearly i'll just</font>

651
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,850
got a massive weaponized session so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

652
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,649
doesn't go off to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> get up and get the</font>

653
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:18,280
get an obsession<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way did</font>

654
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:20,500
this is 280 renovating so ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font>

655
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,260
to me but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just that just stops</font>

656
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,610
every issue like<font color="#E5E5E5"> regress</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

657
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,290
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because you actually been able</font>

658
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:30,040
to connect through prevents quite

659
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,928
channels or<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual session and</font>

660
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,510
we've got a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple post modules book</font>

661
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:35,919
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some bloody really any men to a</font>

662
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:39,730
talk about how simple it is to our

663
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,890
personal you realistically it's when you

664
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,750
eat<font color="#E5E5E5"> post on your phone I guess we didn't</font>

665
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:45,040
really know how much would wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

666
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this so we didn't know whether they</font>

667
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,379
wanted us to provide although at first

668
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,370
one who's already<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

669
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,530
messing with

670
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:56,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">a listing all the services</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and service</font>

00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">by agreed on a house in Windows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

672
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,379
difficult because you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to SC</font>

673
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,850
to get a name and then you go look in

674
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,650
the registry to get the actual image

675
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,840
path when you're doing basic preventive

676
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:06,460
checks and things like that whereas in

677
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,870
power shots which you like one line of

678
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">code</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it brings you all that data</font>

679
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,770
back so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well actually yeah we</font>

680
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:13,389
could do with it run even post modules

681
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,430
that already<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist but for the</font>

00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">PowerShell session so just again that's</font>

683
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,980
like an interview process because none

684
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:20,410
of them have their own support

685
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">PowerShell go through in anyone's that</font>

686
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,640
we think we can migrate over we can just

687
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:28,240
go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do that or anyone not just</font>

688
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:31,630
listed and finally those that the

<font color="#E5E5E5">rewriting of mixing modules HD said to</font>

690
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:36,400
me one day basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm every object</font>

691
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:39,070
oriented I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go top down with my</font>

692
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:43,120
coding so everyone you're like creating

693
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:45,760
sorry every pelota created 6432 like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

696
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically just object-oriented other</font>

697
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,160
places at once<font color="#CCCCCC"> superclass and you call</font>

698
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:01,690
it from that rather than writing code

699
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:03,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten times make sense if you're good so</font>

700
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to demo the 64-bit</font>

701

basically with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mini cats that the</font>

702
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:08,440
loads of laundry so y'all know how this

703
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">differs well i'll talk about it we have</font>

704
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,520
to write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit pretty simple again this</font>

705
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,889
way yeah so i'm doing different way this

706
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,090
time so i'm using this exact so when

707
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,610
this is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait you during all</font>

708
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,709
internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> pat tests you've got add me</font>

709
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,270
crazy surround and you basically want to

710
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,070
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful session instead of a richer</font>

711
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:29,940
procession you can go straight here then

712
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:36,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">go right on a powershell and find tcp</font>

713
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:41,610
64-bit straight out the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

715
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,310
Oh

716
00:30:50,169 --> 00:31:03,830
my secure passwords

717
00:30:53,059 --> 00:31:08,178
but absolutely I'm worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

718
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:09,860
working but I know video rather we had

719
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:11,419
such a discussion no we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font>

720
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,428
live than the believers much like the

721
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:15,289
other war when it goes wrong but

722
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:17,299
actually bingo wrong with it so you can

723
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:19,129
see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just opens up pretty quick to it</font>

724
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:21,679
we haven't loaded any it's not wet<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">marriage to purely powershell the u.s.</font>

726
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,320

727
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:29,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">subtle services system the cool thing is</font>

728
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,918
now so we're going to weaponize it with

729
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:33,700
the other way this is a post module

730
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:36,559
again it isn't in that's wait a moment

731
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,600
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our version of math squad</font>

732
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:43,399

733
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:46,070
there but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm subject to change it</font>

734
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:48,168
and yes is not approved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a pigeon</font>

735
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,639
racing so you can give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a folder you</font>

736
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:51,379
give it script and then you give it a

737
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:54,408
matter spoke such depth sorry para short

738
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:56,059
session to the Indian family we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

739
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:59,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how quick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mrs. as opposed to</font>

740
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:01,730
the very hostile way instagram so

741
00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:03,710
basically it chokes it we have to write

742
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:05,419
stadium because of what was said before

743
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:09,889
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bite size limit was to fight</font>

744
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:11,600
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> we thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2005 now and now</font>

745
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:13,149
you can stage in two thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> bite jobs</font>

746
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,230
so you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> rip away the code</font>

747
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:17,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically it converge the script to the</font>

748
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:19,100
basis of forward splits into troops if

749
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,809
you set this to the bonus<font color="#E5E5E5"> which I didn't</font>

750
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,689
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video it's showing your loading</font>

751
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:25,519
each chunk and that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sent one</font>

752
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,529
yeah it's a learning 45<font color="#CCCCCC"> gemstone songs</font>

753
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,799
that's quite a big one that's probably

754
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,210
in what movie

755
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it's still fairly quick doing what</font>

756
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:36,279
what size of scripture alone so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

757
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:40,679
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> that learning in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 scripts 11 or</font>

758
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:40,679
the password stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> full power</font>

759
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,600
so you can see it up to basically it

760
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:56,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">pucks in two variables you see that out</font>

761
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but they're all in there</font>

762
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,710
now so you just call them as the

763
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">function in the module then maybe half</font>

764
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,520
the size exported machine you're in your

765
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,740
system you can outtalk else asked and

766
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get the clear text passwords out</font>

767
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,760
memory which is happy day so anyone

768
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's wild on the box you just get the</font>

769
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:20,629
password Elsa<font color="#E5E5E5"> again no such as this so</font>

770
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,610
this point amy has<font color="#E5E5E5"> got no chance at all</font>

771
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:27,720
and even a forensic investigation pretty

772
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:30,810
tough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information is</font>

773
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,070
power you<font color="#CCCCCC"> step again I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

774
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,570
show you all of them but just show you a

775
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,830
few of the more thing just to prove that

776
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:41,070
it does whatever we're not just talking

777
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:43,790
 now if you take a little while was

778
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:45,840
a wicked talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk I just probably good</font>

779
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:47,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">there we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to big domain you</font>

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what's out there from</font>

cream cheese

783
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:59,480
this is quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big deal isn't it a lot</font>

784
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:01,620
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about trusts and</font>

785
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,070
actually what you can do if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

786
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:07,110
access information on interests and also

787
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:09,779
now many cats<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bali believe it can</font>

actually use<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust abuse those</font>

million cats has not once

794
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:31,949
just to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you there so what you might</font>

795
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,289
not realize is when you're running like

796
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:36,239
power do it gets an object back so like

797
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:37,679
a pipe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> threw for each basically I</font>

798
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:42,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the same account name</font>

799
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,549
basic term yes they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would just be aware</font>

800
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:46,379
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you rid of these tools some of</font>

801
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,728
the powers it brings back an object so

802
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:49,949
you might have to then<font color="#CCCCCC"> pipe the object</font>

803
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:52,228
to find out what fear the object that

804
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:53,459
you want so if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not working it might</font>

805
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:55,379
be worth giving my knees give me back

806
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:58,198
blows day so this just aware that when

807
00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:00,598
you win stuff in parish on it's been

808
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:05,819
really good essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating mapping</font>

809
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:08,069
object yes last one is basically the

810
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:10,288
HTTP proxy so like I was saying before

811
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:15,479
you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> do to reverse tcp for the</font>

812
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:17,849
Crocs you<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware a situation yes when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

813
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:20,189
a proxy where situation and you want to

814
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:23,880
settle in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pouch or payload by some</font>

815
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:26,849
document via forever and and you want to

816
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,249
use the proxy that's built in I've

817
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:30,509
really enjoyed all that so it does the

818
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:33,390
backhand side of it but it's not

819
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:34,529
integrated into masc yet so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

820
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,359
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've set up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a ruby Haitian to</font>

821
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:38,999
feature the<font color="#CCCCCC"> handles to repress this side</font>

822
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:40,170
and I've set up a load in and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

823
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:42,779
powerful session and that's all

824
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:44,880
basically over HTTP so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

825
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:47,339
teacher's be stream it's all by a teensy

826
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,019
or proxy logs anything but this isn't

827
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:51,089
quite integrate information it's just as

828
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:53,519
good of a shell and we're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

829
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:56,190
essentials that with it it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

830
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,649
quite and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you go into</font>

831
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,020
medicine

832
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:03,270
we are coated in needs to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

833
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,270
that fruit and wait until the house

834
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:14,170
documentation ism follow but we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

835
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:17,230
that simple functional and that's pretty

836
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:19,030
much it as you see that most of its

837
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:21,520
matters quite stop it but again energies

838
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:25,060
telling you booth red white girls while

839
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:29,590
all of our and in a simplest way it's

840
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:32,830
using the three lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to</font>

841
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:37,630
print and whatever just rips it and you

842
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:40,000
use in the session shelter them and the

843
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:43,410
contents of the PS command variable to

844
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,510
really the first module of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our session</font>

845
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,890
yeah first it's in its simplest form if

846
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,690
you want to go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there by tomorrow or</font>

847
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">put it in your data set or folder and</font>

848
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:53,560
use it against our powershell sessions

849
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:56,470
and that's what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do coffee</font>

850
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,610
place that you can write<font color="#E5E5E5"> like load if</font>

851
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:00,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't need you but you can my</font>

852
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:01,810
PowerShell command sorry strict but if

853
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,080
you want to prop it in max Boyce you can

854
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:07,000
go you poster with a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of session run</font>

855
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,500
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do it it's all that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bring</font>

856
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">the back is all the services obviously</font>

857
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,540
anything you can write in power shopping

858
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,130
for my Indian so it's just quite a cool

859
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,740
way to 30<font color="#CCCCCC"> inch credit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's a bit more</font>

860
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:19,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Empire so vampires who uses the</font>

861
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:23,430
modules and doesn't like doin anything

862
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly that's how you can do that</font>

863
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:34,359
motorists bog standard medical stuff so

864
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:38,770
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

865
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:43,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">on recently as we said earlier that the</font>

866
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:43,859
powerful of ps1 it's a powershell<font color="#E5E5E5"> script</font>

867
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:53,440
and lattice<font color="#E5E5E5"> weighting system deploys</font>

868
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:58,060
park on his payload and that's where the

869
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:00,540
powerful at ps1 script lives<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you take</font>

870
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:04,869
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> coat and modify very slightly</font>

871
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:06,790
you'll see it's a function you can

872
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:09,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually incorporate our function into a</font>

873
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:11,590
script and then the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this to you</font>

874
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:17,560
really it's just what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to do</font>

875
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:20,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it so we talked about our compact</font>

876
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,700
is well that's how compact it is when

877
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,660
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it in a powershell</font>

878
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:27,368
scripts 46 lines of code and in this one

879
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,589
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to see at the top</font>

880
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:32,859
there you're not going to see where it

881
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:34,450
says change this at the top so that's

882
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:37,029
Anunnaki address where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want the</font>

883
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:40,810
connections come back to buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> into and</font>

884
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:42,130
then the part and that will when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you run</font>

885
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,450
that and you've got a listener there

886
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:46,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come back and give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font>

887
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:52,540
PowerShell session it's as simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

888
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:54,430
that so how can we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it well an</font>

889
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,050
efficient attack for instance so we all

whatever way you decided to make this

896

thing so it calls in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a bit more clever and a bit more evil as</font>

906
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:41,000
it says that we're going to use

<font color="#E5E5E5">PowerShell in its proper way that</font>

908
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,960
powershell can work so we're going to

909
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:46,880
write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a script and use functionality</font>

you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> get done at the bottom I'm</font>

915
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:59,810
assuming that so we're going to use

916
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">PowerShell to get lots of information</font>

box to email it back to me and then

922
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,359
we're going to drop a shell in a new

process using powerful all done

924

ethically like says<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're all done</font>

925
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:24,470
with powershell so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take one exam</font>

926
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:26,060
one part of that we've got let's get

927
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:31,310
some information from the network so

928

938
00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:01,070
let's look at active directory this is

<font color="#E5E5E5">just an example this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of the fact</font>

way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't used it here is I created</font>

985
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:53,729
a script block<font color="#CCCCCC"> or it's actually not</font>

986
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:56,069
separate fun like Ben's was dropped on

987
00:42:53,729 --> 00:42:57,868
the box mine's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> Park the scripts</font>

988
00:42:56,069 --> 00:43:01,079
you create what's called houses with one

00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:03,390
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the job is running from the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">function and blood of our like through</font>

991
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,749
there I've been too technical other then

992
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:09,690
there's the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> method which is what</font>

993
00:43:06,749 --> 00:43:13,319
probably more work today stroll run

994
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:15,660
spaces which are a lot more control<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

995
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:18,599
can buy what color throttles and supply

996
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,578
that stopped the actual process is

997
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:23,219
running away with themselves and you can

998
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:25,619
remorseful to leave an unnatural memory

999
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:27,690
and the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> service campaign you can</font>

1000
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:30,809
you don't impact on the box whatsoever

1001
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:32,989
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> using either of these methods</font>

1002
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:35,579
whichever way you choose we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can drop</font>

1003
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:38,549
powerful into a completely separate

1004
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:41,249
process and connect back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our command</font>

1005
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:44,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">of control and just sit there up early</font>

1006
00:43:41,249 --> 00:43:47,368
even after the main scripts did you

1007
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:50,969
don't so like I said you asked for the

1008
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:53,190
kress that's what the user sees on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1009
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:55,289
screen like I've bled about my domain

1010
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:58,619
out that's my pacifier username there

1011
00:43:55,289 --> 00:44:00,479
any type of us went into the box one

1012
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:02,609
lovely thing about power shadows and<font color="#E5E5E5"> max</font>

1013
00:44:00,479 --> 00:44:04,948
off if they thought the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> cube for so</font>

1014
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:08,430
you know you type that in but it's

1015
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:11,640
encrypted well technically not it is

1016
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:13,830
encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> well there's a prophecy of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1017
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,120
get up get so good

1018
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:19,660
actually allows you to extract in clear

1019
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:22,990
text only if you do it well<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1020
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:24,879
powershell sessions actually active if

1021
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,379
you close<font color="#CCCCCC"> that partial session the key</font>

1022
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,200
is gone completely on everything fruit

1023
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,300
so if you actually take that property

1024
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:36,700
and stick I in your email you get there

1025
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:38,740
clear text grunts and that's just the

1026
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,020
that's just doing that are so listen to

1027
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:43,660
do with net cap or end caps or even

1028
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:46,930
wanna come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> enma obviously i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1029
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">saved accessor sale you get back it's up</font>

1030
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:51,009
to the same thing despite winning the

1031
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,780
powerful scripts so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just how you</font>

1032
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,640
can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside an asteroid it's not</font>

1033
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:56,830
just in that's what you wanted to go in

1034
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,410
the mess with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can face it a day</font>

1035
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:01,090
just taking it mess with in usually

1036
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:04,390
completely standalone it if you want to

1037
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:06,910
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way anymore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's next look</font>

1038
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:09,819
again that's just the email that my

1039
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:12,549
email account set back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me with its</font>

1040
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:16,510
insulation and that's basically how you

1041
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:18,160
well you just get whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you decide to</font>

1042
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:20,740
collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get the whole thing to</font>

1043
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,399
send email<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and that's all in basic</font>

1044
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:23,399
functionality

1045
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:34,299
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lattice point is</font>

1046
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:38,500
actually a usual thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had to be</font>

1047
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:43,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsible hackers i guess if we must</font>

1048
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:46,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so is it possible to stop this yeah</font>

1049
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:50,609
so you can do close monitor them as well

1050
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:52,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can blacklist stroke wireless</font>

1051
00:45:50,609 --> 00:45:55,569
applications in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guarantee good</font>

1052
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,330
policy you can change firewall rules to

1053
00:45:55,570 --> 00:46:01,150
stop accessed by it whatever challenge

1054
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:02,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">we decide to stop those are the 18 for</font>

1055
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">for free direct and that kind of thing</font>

1056
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,759
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got systems like bit now</font>

1057
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,770
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> calibike after Steve clearly that</font>

1058
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,060
one on the end of this week yes they

1059
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,940
were like we've written a blog post

1060
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:14,980
about stopping this new empire tool

1061
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:19,240
that's been released that be sighs over

1062
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:21,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last week though so if you see that</font>

1063
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:26,200
that's the event blog so i guess like

1064
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:29,890
same systems would see in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the event log</font>

1065
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:32,230
that power shoulder EFC was wrong but

1066
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:33,790
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all they see they don't see</font>

1067
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:35,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's actually being right inside the</font>

1068
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">powershell sessions yes they would you</font>

1069
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,250
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in very proud of these</font>

1070
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:41,859
apparently they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seem purely</font>

1071
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:43,420
pouch are being run with their encoded

1072
00:46:41,859 --> 00:46:45,190
script locked and how do you reverse

1073
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,700
everything else has done and no that'll

1074
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:47,700
be log here

1075
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:55,078
so it's fairly simplistic and actually

1076
00:46:51,749 --> 00:46:57,598
that needs individual boxes to be

1077
00:46:55,079 --> 00:47:01,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">modified registry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hacks to allow to</font>

1078
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,779
happen to see the bottom you can

1079
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:06,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually see for us this command line</font>

1080
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:08,339
powershell like I was in calculus exam

1081
00:47:06,209 --> 00:47:09,959
what he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but to make that</font>

1082
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:12,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen you need to have your very own</font>

1083
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:16,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">which box to do it and then we've got</font>

1084
00:47:12,989 --> 00:47:18,180
group policies I said blacklist a

1085
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:20,009
bloodless obviously out the best way to

1086
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:22,680
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this white listing is probably the</font>

1087
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:24,209
best option that's one way to stop it

1088
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,729
running and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't stop the attack</font>

1089
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:29,519
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can stop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell a THC running</font>

1090
00:47:26,729 --> 00:47:31,618
in our context that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the game over is</font>

1091
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:35,669
no there's no there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> ifs books wise</font>

1092
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:39,809
main reasons the end of the game but

1093
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:42,630
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways around huh and then we've</font>

1094
00:47:39,809 --> 00:47:45,049
obviously got seven firewall to stop any

1095
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,049
uterus

1096
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:53,490
bit9 carbon black<font color="#CCCCCC"> retinol they can do</font>

1097
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:57,299
this kind of thing as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well but they only</font>

1098
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:59,819
detects Kyle shoulder AFC being<font color="#E5E5E5"> run they</font>

1099
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:03,290
again have got no defense against walls

1100
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:06,300
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Li injection reflexive lowly</font>

1101
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:10,890
which another way if anybody's seen or

1102
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:13,410
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> use em pilot which was released by</font>

1103

harm join in six Stewart<font color="#E5E5E5"> besides</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lb</font>

1105
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:21,710
they've got what's called reflexive do

1106
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,380
unloading for an agent or<font color="#CCCCCC"> session</font>

1107
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:26,910
there's no defense against our present

1108
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:28,710
so you don't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pouch other action</font>

1109
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:30,480
box you block it front row center

<font color="#CCCCCC">thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> witness the allow</font>

1111
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,840
somehow probably many people don't

1112
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:40,170
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pouch ella eh c</font>

1113
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:42,540
program is just a wrapper for<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor and</font>

1114
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:44,400
all the api's behind that windows is

1115
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:47,070
essentially an<font color="#CCCCCC"> API based operating</font>

1116
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,440
system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the powershell the exe just</font>

1117
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:52,380
provides a<font color="#E5E5E5"> front-end that allows to</font>

1118
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:56,700
access all that behind it so you can

1119
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:59,460
actually even gotten that classy cell so

1120
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,899
we can interact directly with it and

1121
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:05,150
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deal an injection part</font>

1122
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,150
works with the back

1123
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:12,650
so essentially you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use PowerShell</font>

00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:15,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sure if you have get using it and</font>

1125
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:17,809
pretty cool for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a job where people</font>

1126
00:49:15,729 --> 00:49:22,549
stealthy and not just get on with it

1127
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:25,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">brickma how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great a blog about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it at</font>

1128
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:26,989
using it your choice so if you anything

1129
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,699
pick a side homie available<font color="#CCCCCC"> at well</font>

1130
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:38,539
later so from a go for anything but<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet</font>

1131
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:42,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suitable buffer and hope you have</font>

1132
00:49:38,539 --> 00:49:44,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">a look at any random slate after this is</font>

1133
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:46,459
being run to look for things like the

1134
00:49:44,269 --> 00:49:48,169
email address that nods might be set

1135
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:50,448
being sent away to or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

1136
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:54,459
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an exchange that would</font>

1137
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:56,689
that be because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I step for a box women</font>

1138
00:49:54,459 --> 00:50:00,348
so you're effectively you've the send

1139
00:49:56,689 --> 00:50:02,058
email messages effectively using like

1140
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:04,719
the exchange server to send the email

1141
00:50:02,059 --> 00:50:07,640
other users connected to or i will first

1142
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">record of the commands would be left</font>

1143
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,609
behind from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> publisher clean though</font>

1144
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:13,099
if you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like volatility</font>

1145
00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:14,569
over a standard window random you can

1146
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:17,630
pull out a list of the recently run

1147
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:20,079
commands from command i see so would

1148
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:22,969
that be similar to powershell because

1149
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,979
the scripts are being run that it will

1150
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:26,769
essentially be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like typing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

1151
00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:29,118
commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm presuming into ram</font>

1152
00:50:26,769 --> 00:50:30,589
parachute while the if the house of them

1153
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,890
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> boonton it's in</font>

1154
00:50:30,589 --> 00:50:35,569
the same fashion again<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to shoot</font>

1155
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:37,578
myself before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you exactly like I've</font>

1156
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:39,999
grown is more digital forensics so if

1157
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:42,619
this was to be entirely<font color="#CCCCCC"> stealthy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1158
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:45,348
useful for it to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back through memory</font>

1159
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:47,900
and perhaps or scrub things like that

1160
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:48,799
out there because responder<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're sort</font>

1161
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,109
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that people are going to be</font>

1162
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:54,019
looking for you should download quickly

1163
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:59,710
yeah what you can should publish don't

1164
00:50:54,019 --> 00:51:02,029
be so sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way stopping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we thank you</font>

1165
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:03,529
so now it is a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good point i have</font>

1166
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:05,930
a look that's like that at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1167
00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:07,160
that's not really my<font color="#CCCCCC"> side it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

1168
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,109
worth looking at because as you said

1169
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,538
with the vostro you would get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the output</font>

1170
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:13,519
etc around all of those commands being

1171
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:16,579
run there you see anything text goes to

1172
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:18,379
the time so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though as a from a</font>

1173
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:20,749
remote attackers point of view you're

1174
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,460
not going to see the descript being put

1175
00:51:20,749 --> 00:51:23,868
together and the little<font color="#E5E5E5"> line of command</font>

1176
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,470
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> email it back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself you're</font>

1177
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:27,320
just going to be

1178
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:28,819
see email this to me essentially or

1179
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,010
whatever I find you might be running I

1180
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:33,260
do be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to see how much</font>

1181
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:39,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual script gets left behind in</font>

1182
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:57,050
our job for you right make sure you

1183
00:51:39,800 --> 00:52:01,490
mention anybody else I guess some some

1184
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:03,710
might pick up maybe like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a PDF in or</font>

1185
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:06,560
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's got our references I</font>

1186
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:09,020
think it's over time will actually stop

1187
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:14,690
it and be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taxi memory once you on the</font>

1188
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:16,700
box yes I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> really cuts can</font>

1189
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:18,740
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> detective but only is it's dropped on</font>

1190
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,569
the boss<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they detect the actual</font>

1191
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,759
name of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file and some of the others</font>

1192
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:24,050
inside politics so if you change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1193
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:28,340
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the file and you take the head</font>

1194
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:32,270
is aways and then like I said if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1195
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:34,430
open the PowerShell command and then map

00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:35,780
the drive with new PS drives your share

1197
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the other end that's what should all</font>

1198
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,800
your evil tools in it you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">anything so you can win them happy as</font>

1200
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,390

1205
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,550
overhead on looking a memory and a

1206
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:58,000
powerful session on that solution was

1207
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:58,000
canceled
