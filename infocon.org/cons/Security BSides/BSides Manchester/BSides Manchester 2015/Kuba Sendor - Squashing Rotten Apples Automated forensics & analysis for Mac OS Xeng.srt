support / 29 locals and that's true what

72
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,370
how accurate is this like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

73
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,050
launching also in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your countries over</font>

74
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,510
this year we introduced like yelling

75
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,780
between your countries and then us up to

76
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:57,630
around 33 million of the mobile users

77
00:03:51,780 --> 00:04:00,810
and also around 139 million visitors on

78
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,810
our website and what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means is that</font>

79
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,950
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong 3,000 employees right now</font>

problem is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like fishing</font>

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:18,810
or some other sources of malware viruses

87
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,770
you were thinking that<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe like in the</font>

88
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,000
max they're quite secure that was like

89
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:40,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">previously with there were moments like</font>

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,860
better than windows machine species it's

91
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,840
no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case there are sort of</font>

92
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,150
like victims of their own popularity so

93
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,750
because right now more and more people

94
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:53,080
are using macbooks it's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

95
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,940
attackers people create more work to

96
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,669
create all this fishing campaign there

97
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,860
also are getting more and more mac users

98
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:03,490
and especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance if you go to</font>

99
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,470
else it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like cnet CC netcom they're</font>

100
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,790
actually full of malware like most of

101
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,150
the applications they're a family with

102
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:14,830
malware if you're running any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

103
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:16,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">like corporate firewall for blocking</font>

104
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,609
websites falling block<font color="#E5E5E5"> Donald come</font>

105
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,190
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's coming always package</font>

106
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,470
malware so any kind of applications like

107
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,690
advertising themselves free media player

108
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,580
free media converter for mac book it's

109
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,530
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much most advanced model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

110
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:35,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">mahler so we see that more and more</font>

111
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:36,429
nowadays and for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past most we didn't</font>

112
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,130
have really proper response for that

113
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,520
like whenever there was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> employee from</font>

114
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:46,150
their hot desk with very fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like</font>

115
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,370
the most of the reasons was looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

116
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,289
animation so we just like okay yeah

117
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,330
sorry for that we was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to whack</font>

118
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,830
your machine to you a new one in your

119
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,580
system because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was only so much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

120
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:01,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do we were looking this certified for</font>

121
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,690
investigative power to few hours was

122
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:08,450
going wrong with the mall we came from

123
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:11,210
and so my manager Ivan he said no the

124
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:14,570
weekend and created this solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> POSIX</font>

125
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,900
collector which is really cool for

126
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,700
forensics of disconnection and natural

127
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,310
so we have examined all these components

128
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that so this project is open source</font>

129
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:30,110
it's a little their own via hub you can

130
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:32,060
just go to get out it's very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

131
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,180
it's just like 15<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 5 so whenever we</font>

132
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:39,350
have some infected machine or how this

133
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:42,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">person will just go to the person just</font>

134
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:46,640
run this like to do first of all is like

135
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:49,159
we won't prevent any further progress on

136
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the power so you really thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

137
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,160
person will directly disconnect the

138
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,840
machine from the network so the pro like

139
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,530
you were running any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> principle was</font>

140
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,479
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey how do we actually get there so</font>

141
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:06,109
maybe not very secure manner we usually

142
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,030
head over this file<font color="#E5E5E5"> one USB</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> steak</font>

143
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,900
temperatures making a very secure

144
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:14,119
practice so thank you ms such simple who

145
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,359
can we just shipped as apology on the

146
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,719
verizon

147
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,539
might book so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't have any other</font>

148
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:24,389
dependencies and that so usually could

149
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:26,250
just run very easily and what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it</font>

150
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:32,400
collect all this all these different

151
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:36,150
forensics from the machine what it

152
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,030
produces eventually a JSON output it's

153
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:42,508
very nice additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> days beautiful so</font>

154
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:44,609
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very human</font>

155
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:48,930
readable a relation rippable in the

156
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:54,840
sense that it's very process so each

157
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:57,029
sort of a forensic source produces one

158
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:02,789
just now to climb that we can later on

159
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:05,550
analyze what's also both to about OS<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

160
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:08,279
is that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> caused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of this data in</font>

161
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular format so it was very</font>

162
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,289
important for us to collect as much as

163
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,050
possible admission was already giving to

164
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:21,960
us and part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

165
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:24,650
macbook stays in a sicko I databases so

166
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:29,698
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy in Python to actually</font>

167
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:34,319
just drop the content of the of the

168
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:40,500
SQLite database so<font color="#E5E5E5"> injustice few</font>

169
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:43,210
 code we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow some</font>

170
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,850
pieces of forensic information from the

171
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:49,240
machine what's not unless too late

172
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:53,050
databases they're very particular format

173
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,200
similar to windows registry in Michael

174
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,479
Westen gold the list prepared lists its

175
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,840
symptoms in the binary format sometimes

176
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,870
it is just a plain text PDF a folded

177
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:14,020
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XML that you see here</font>

178
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:16,570
on right inside for and yeah there is

179
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,850
there's like multiple other of different

180
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,890
for instance information stored in

181
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,840
different parts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of the system</font>

182
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:26,560
that classics collector easily

183
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:29,610
collection including one very uniform

184
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,609
art form

185
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,989
so do with this illest we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

186
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,260
using foundation library from business

187
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,450
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> burro program all objective-c</font>

188
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:44,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">actions so they are very that mean their</font>

189
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,100
names so that's maybe something going

190
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:49,370
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from all the spice and conventions</font>

191
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:54,350
this is more sort of like this objective

192
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:59,330
c walker that made it<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

193
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:04,730
use therapies go to for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ruthie</font>

194
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:07,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">Phyllis in your sis collector code so</font>

195
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,560
what kind of information is<font color="#E5E5E5"> X collector</font>

196
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,650
is covering from the operating system

197
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,989
from Marco ass apart from like some

198
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">general system information like you</font>

199
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:21,190
student version which accounts are

200
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:24,320
running on the system it also collects

201
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:27,470
kernel extensions like this downloads of

202
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,170
vacations also so the web browser

203
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:34,339
information so browser history multi

204
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:39,260
very important in the forensic analysis

205
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:41,570
so we see user's activity in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Indy</font>

206
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,780
browser we see which password download

207
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:47,720
that we are also able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab some human</font>

208
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:51,880
formation so was like ow attachments

209
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:55,130
from the system application and all

210
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,060
different solid items that also must

211
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,060
ocean

212
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:11,750
so as mentioned before this is sorting

213
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:15,500
long uniform Jason sort of globe which

214
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,960
contains<font color="#CCCCCC"> or unified field for us so for</font>

215
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,400
instance wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever there is</font>

216
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:29,090
involved in download browser download

217
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:33,410
restore md5 checksum for the first time

218
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:36,290
stamps also for instance signature chain

219
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:39,910
and some the list employed what was the

220
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,980
actual source of this information so

221
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:46,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">passe exploiter does pretty neat job of</font>

222
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:49,070
unifying all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stem so I've shown</font>

223
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:51,830
British like they all different sources

224
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,170
of foreign<font color="#E5E5E5"> state information and this is</font>

225
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,910
very cumbersome when you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

226
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,880
gather them manually for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

227
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:01,040
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> sources because a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> version of</font>

228
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the old different web browser</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place or</font>

229
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,599
time some information and all their

230
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:10,930
respective format so you can send us a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font>

231
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:14,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">milliseconds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fill 9070 or seconds from</font>

232
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:18,849
91 or like different browsers look like

233
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:20,450
different particular but they considered

234
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:26,200
your orgasm

235
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:26,200
sorry book so actually one of my first

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,960
just to figure out what is using which

237
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:42,470
former to store the information through

238
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:44,450
so like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bangkok approach to store one</font>

239
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,090
single from other types of information

240
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:50,870
because this is very much important when

241
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:56,000
you do for instance on Liz's show some

242
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:58,490
examples later on I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,590
hashes so while you may hear different

244
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,550
stories about houses nowadays something

245
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:07,400
that's free like yeah the virus is

246
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:10,339
welding you can do really just stupid

247
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,860
past operation<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not with article</font>

248
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:15,130
we should be a gravel is this the sort

249
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">of stuff because you can obfuscate that</font>

250
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,250
well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only been</font>

251
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one principles</font>

252
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,920
so stool hashes are very important in

253
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,950
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> music service like I result this is</font>

254
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,849
something that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really at least</font>

255
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:33,350
the first item to try together

256
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:37,319
so they're pretty useful or not that

257
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,699
also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corner piece so whatever you</font>

258
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:43,439
download something on the interview is

259
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:46,500
using up is this block of this window

260
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,420
inflammation displaying I hey I'm sure

261
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,579
you within this application I mean yeah

262
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,410
the old idiot from into and that so I'm

263
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,810
free to have to endure what's really

264
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,459
cool about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heart from the big open</font>

265
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:59,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that this information actually stays</font>

266
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:01,888
forever on your disk in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Phyllis so</font>

267
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,500
once you're running the forensics

268
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:06,480
collection on the impact system will

269
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,069
actually see all different point teams

270
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,319
that were displayed for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a user we can</font>

271
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:15,199
already grasped information about life

272
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:18,149
what's the source of the infection a

273
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:22,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">certain items is another thing that I</font>

274
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:24,600
was expeditor collective on our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Center</font>

275
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,819
like around seven different places where

276
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,579
they started items in pop<font color="#E5E5E5"> up like you're</font>

277
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:35,069
on directory the main republication

278
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:38,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">start directory things like that so</font>

279
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:38,479
those covers all the difference

280
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:48,829
Papa stomach by the way and so yeah

281
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:51,949
fertilize it pretty important because

282
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:55,839
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> somewhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not like it's like</font>

283
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:58,300
came over so yeah pretty much for us

284
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">information like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at least for this</font>

285
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:04,459
machine what we'll do is probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

286
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:09,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">this certified</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the machine to swipe</font>

287
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:09,189
at night don't try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

288
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,229
so think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature change like</font>

289
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:21,279
Alex doesn't really care so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

290
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:23,470
the weather the batteries are signed on

291
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,709
that but for you it<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

292
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:35,350
important information at us to your

293
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:40,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">processivity of small-time finery this</font>

294
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:47,139
might be also<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful for your forensic</font>

295
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:49,329
analysis so yeah this few slides were

296
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:52,000
showing more informational like all

297
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:54,660
different things that I was expelled

298
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,100
there is a book<font color="#E5E5E5"> we collect but actually</font>

299
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,769
yeah the collection is sort of like this

300
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,779
hard carbon a certain way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want</font>

301
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:03,990
to do manually because my stuff what's

302
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:08,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool and finds is sort of like</font>

303
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:12,630
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> art and science is the project</font>

304
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,630
let's say more interesting

305
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:24,110
so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are selling reduces so as</font>

306
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,760
many previously time stops are very

307
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful when it comes to figuring out</font>

308
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:32,960
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the machine so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

309
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:34,969
have your infection alert for instance

310
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,880
you have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> information from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> virus</font>

311
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,470
like oh yeah this<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine doesn't like</font>

312
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this this time you could already</font>

313
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:46,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">stopped by the way with very simple</font>

314
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:49,180
grabber on the time stamp like few

315
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:51,830
seconds open back will already give you

316
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:57,079
sort of like first and it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

317
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:59,860
this came from if you change with tools

318
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:04,730
like GQ which is really cool way of

319
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:08,569
making Jason even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more readable and for</font>

320
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:14,089
instance shooting something like SQL SQL

321
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:16,490
queries or Jason content and very few

322
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:20,300
steps at least you all URLs<font color="#E5E5E5"> or visit</font>

323
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:24,050
time it can show you the activities from

324
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:26,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">a set user of the machine also for us</font>

325
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,750
some indication was like whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

326
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of accounts</font>

327
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,550
same machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> where machines were used</font>

328
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,680
among different employees some of the

329
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,120
malware who is already there before we

330
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,900
started like doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this transient</font>

331
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,550
analysis was staying there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and easy for</font>

332
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,860
us to figure out like a yeah this is

333
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:45,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming from from the other user that's</font>

334
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,399
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only more on this machine so yeah</font>

335
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:50,660
that's wipe it right away there is no

336
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,290
way we should continue using summation

337
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,290
really working the system

338
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:02,830
fresh installation role in the other

339
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:05,530
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really neat</font>

340
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:08,110
but when it comes to like doing it every

341
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,910
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> rev real life you have it might be a</font>

342
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,379
bit cumbersome so why don't we actually

343
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:15,970
automate that and this is what we

344
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:19,390
started doing so all this sort of manual

345
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:22,780
steps that we noticed that we're doing

346
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:24,490
continuously of every incident we

347
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,410
started like looking at is like yeah

348
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,030
there are some small fingering every

349
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,929
time like sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example from grab</font>

350
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:36,850
around the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sample T of the</font>

351
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:40,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">infection contacting some credible</font>

352
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:42,459
sources like<font color="#CCCCCC"> virustotal or opendns with</font>

353
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,800
the hashes or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the domain user visit than</font>

354
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:47,020
see what's wrong with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so we just</font>

355
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,379
select<font color="#E5E5E5"> the islets let's little to my</font>

356
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:54,370
death and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> created sort of channel</font>

357
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:56,410
filters that we can pass this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

358
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:59,428
wire second<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mexico how Isis collector</font>

359
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:02,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">through will enrich all this information</font>

360
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:05,380
one by<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so they're very simple and</font>

361
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,879
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way they work like is each filter</font>

362
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,400
sort of like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more</font>

363
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,130
information into this out generated from

364
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">us X collector and the very end will of</font>

365
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:18,360
stuff is sort of like recommendation and

366
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,360
things that

367
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,040
office filters can suggest you blocking

368
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:29,240
certain domain or<font color="#CCCCCC"> other certain files st</font>

369
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,060
or internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> blacklist so for instance by</font>

370
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:37,010
Thome at find<font color="#CCCCCC"> online</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still there we'll</font>

371
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:39,500
just try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have fun URL for instance</font>

372
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,870
some dough has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sub domain and try to</font>

373
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:45,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">dissect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it into list of possible domains</font>

374
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:48,620
that could be this could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be related to</font>

375
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,500
so give me a subdomain<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll just so</font>

376
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:54,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">resolver like the root domain you have</font>

377
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,600
some URL<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try to get all different</font>

378
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,000
domains that are appearing in this URL

379
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:03,169
so for instance if some of them domains

380
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:10,910
are in troopers parameters you also try

381
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:13,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to identify them take them out put them</font>

382
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:17,510
in this separate them why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

383
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:20,300
useful is the later on we can directly

384
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:24,100
check this against some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our internal</font>

385
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:26,750
blackness so throughout this continues

386
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:30,230
always a business process we gather<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

387
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:33,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">serve internally blacklist with all</font>

388
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,240
different suspicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs suspicious</font>

389
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,370
domains that we were checking<font color="#CCCCCC"> director</font>

390
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,820
either way before

391
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,860
let's say digging<font color="#CCCCCC"> deeper into into any</font>

392
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,350
of the other so if user or visited some

393
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">samples already potentially a sign up</font>

394
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,760
yeah this is there is something wrong

395
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,550
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machine so I knew things like</font>

396
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,129
yes during football it's called things

397
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:57,700
like that of all pretty mention dolls

398
00:20:54,130 --> 00:21:00,250
has come see that yeah there was a visit

399
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that website you ever like wires are</font>

400
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:07,180
sure that user has something gone the

401
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:12,400
machine it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> indication for</font>

402
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:15,160
some purchased absolutely so this check

403
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,520
like this filter is just checking this

404
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:21,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">boeing's the way sort of excavated from</font>

405
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:25,080
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> initialize X collector up with</font>

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:30,730
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the agenda of the</font>

408
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:38,090
so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this different sources</font>

409
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:42,320
jim was mentioning in the previous talk

410
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:44,899
things like our conver useful source to

411
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,110
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's something wrong with the</font>

412
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,490
domain there is also show the server

413
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:53,049
like Natasha's there is virus although

414
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:56,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using so for any hash in the</font>

00:21:53,049 --> 00:22:00,200
output of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> USS collector we can just</font>

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:14,120
how many heads were work on some work

419

424
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:33,129
far as yourself goes make it there run

425
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:35,928
like 60 these are sources of different

426
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,669
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is checking into so it</font>

437
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:10,580
with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

438
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:14,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">barcelo API there are some also thanks</font>

439
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:17,510
included in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> lookup filter that</font>

440
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,040
makes it a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking there's</font>

441
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:22,780
like only one<font color="#CCCCCC"> by one for my request</font>

442
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:27,290
eventually issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the same time so</font>

443
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:29,870
there is peace<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it's it's quite a bit</font>

444
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:36,230
there is also sort of internal hashing

445
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:37,939
so we we are using premium subscription

446
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:41,360
program so that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an online I</font>

447
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:44,150
think 25<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests remember something</font>

448
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,040
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that someone mounted capabilities</font>

449
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,840
when it comes to request right but i

450
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,850
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre version comes just like</font>

451
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,730
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was per second so this is sort</font>

452
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:55,340
of like very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you see a</font>

453
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:58,370
little bit pulling it back from doing

454
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">this massive analysis of all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the domains</font>

455
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,479
knowing that if you run OSX collector on

456
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the machine that was run for couple of</font>

457
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,150
moms there are probably thousands

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">thousands demise that the person visited</font>

459
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:14,990
so running<font color="#E5E5E5"> through all of this for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

460
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:17,639
machine you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> repeatedly</font>

461
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,830
very long so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing we're</font>

462
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:24,290
cashing their responses so if you have

463
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:29,220
the same website<font color="#CCCCCC"> visit by people went</font>

464
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:31,740
wrong the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> foreigner styx analysis</font>

465
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,870
of the USS collector output people just

466
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,630
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of calling again by Ursula API</font>

467
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:38,909
will just pull your internal hash and

468
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:42,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">drop this information for you of course</font>

469
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:45,360
this comes with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of</font>

470
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,820
background like yeah there<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't change</font>

471
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,610
in the domain reputation for instance or

472
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,470
passages i doubt it will change so much

473
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:57,959
what all these with actors in the things

474
00:24:52,470 --> 00:25:00,900
discovered done it for try to call it

475
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:04,350
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this hash is this channel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

476
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:07,160
right now very simple but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we may</font>

477
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,159
think of life

478
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,720
you pre populate your hashtag<font color="#E5E5E5"> basis the</font>

479
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:17,110
public databases speak like nests<font color="#E5E5E5"> ash</font>

480
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,960
databases so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is that we</font>

481
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:22,270
decree both of the from the public that

482
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">they've a database of this past week we</font>

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily doing any creation</font>

484
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,449
ization of the database this is more

485
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,610
like when something was visited like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

486
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">will just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cut the response we learn to</font>

imply something let's download

00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:39,850
everything at the very beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">double cross but this is a very idea</font>

490
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:46,020
that maybe I should also investigate

491
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,020
something in doesn't matter

492
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:57,030
similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a virus vocal another source</font>

493
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,679
you can use its shadow server so server

494
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:02,570
will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something opposite so rather</font>

495
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:04,680
than checking like that scans of the

00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,990
Lassiter bad it will actually tell you

497
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:10,800
which files are good so all the fuss

498
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:13,020
that are startled items of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the brush</font>

00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:19,770
sort of acting as a white list for for

all the houses that alone on this and

like relate joins to the domain with we

<font color="#CCCCCC">because you will spell that like maybe</font>

00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,639
the domain itself is not looking very

we can already be some further

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> G domain or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really malicious so</font>

that's over the air<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter opendns uses</font>

523
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:34,480
only two mentioned related domains and

524
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,820
my reputation there is also a

525
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,280
categorization filter so it can usually

526
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:42,340
like at a very peaceful time that's

527
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,320
coming from the power category yeah it's

528
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:48,280
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that so there is nobody</font>

I was just generated from some machine

00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,510
that's what's they trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> register</font>

554
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:03,110
some domains do some bad stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this</font>

555
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:05,570
dumbass and just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> go sit down today</font>

556
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:08,100
there are some things like for instance

557
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:11,760
domain age that can be also very useful

558
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:16,350
when it comes to analysis of the

559
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,810
potentially malicious sources usually if

560
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:20,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">you see something downloaded from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

561
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:22,590
de- create that there are like couple

562
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:25,530
hours ago minutes ago this is rather

563
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:28,350
malicious it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like generated</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">online something that we do for her on</font>

565
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:39,149
the back so yeah almost different

566
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,800
filters are chained together it's very

567
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy Talia run filter as i was showing</font>

568
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,850
all the examples there just like

569
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,740
equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> including little inputs you</font>

can think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey I want to do</font>

574
00:29:53,730 --> 00:30:00,360
while the filter chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> them together put</font>

575
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,730
some people there's in between you can

576
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,100
run them separately or you can do what

577
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:08,070
we sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> combine</font>

578
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,360
the reasons why a multitude of filter as

579
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:13,139
well so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this information</font>

580

581
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,250
just like collecting all this

information from an ADA from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> API is</font>

583
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:23,370
like Aristotle token dns because this

584

the response of information test to

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

597
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,780
grating and yeah like the one most staff

00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,820
is recommending steps<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz we're able to</font>

as malicious and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will suggest you next</font>

602
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,409
step so in our case it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be there</font>

603
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:26,850
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah let's Lock this website</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">alright that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this this hash or</font>

605
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:31,918
like yeah you should probably look at

606
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,980
this one because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's suspicious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so like</font>

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,470
Ronnie the service as I made<font color="#CCCCCC"> a part but</font>

608
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,720
like later on there's some of my own

609
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:47,150
pocket all that you on your own

610

<font color="#CCCCCC">workpiece suggested suggested next steps</font>

611
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:54,720
what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done with all this</font>

612
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:57,150
credibility is that once we had all this

613
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,250
cult in Isaac's collector we actually

614
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:03,750
take them out put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in a separate</font>

615
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:06,510
library which old friend play p is also

often source on tha just go check it out

617
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:14,340
it has this sort of like dynamic way of

618
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,799
calling obviously api's mentioning the

00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:16,120
from from us that we can add some more

638
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,340
enhancements to google alerts and they

639
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,709
were for instance to information from

640
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:24,730
opendns about particular palette ashes

641

00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:30,820
and and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> others as well so it's very</font>

643
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:33,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy to combine two</font>

648
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,300
better idea about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it more</font>

649
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,300
info

650
00:33:51,590 --> 00:34:00,779
contributions so the life let me know if

651
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:04,019
you're using it or if you're interested

652
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:08,089
in using it if you have some ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

653
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:10,560
can push them out on the market a page

654
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:15,659
sounds pull requests on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berlin</font>

655
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:18,299
conversation so that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much as if</font>

656
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:25,020
you have any questions or we also the

party later on so together that's really

658
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:32,879
impressive cool but it must have been a

659
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:35,819
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work for an internal tool when</font>

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,040
you start it how did the how did the

661
00:34:35,819 --> 00:34:40,589
other alternatives compare like what's

662
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,029
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> National Commercial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative that</font>

generally like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Frances collection or</font>

666
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:53,639
rather like this analysis part because

667
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:56,609
they're like sort of two separate

668
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,890
against more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis</font>

669
00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:01,920
seems like a like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mallya section and</font>

670
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:06,430
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> surprised</font>

already so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it was well liked</font>

672
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,118
around when I was young like from year

673
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:13,750
ago that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we started doing all this</font>

674

process at the point of time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> repay</font>

of like smart kind of thing like just

679
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:29,980
pulling information from salsa so it

680
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:33,130
wasn't a celebrity when it comes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

683
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:39,910
without food for us what was really

684
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,379
important as the very beginning before

685
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:45,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sole information would be also</font>

certain it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> large output it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

689
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:59,130
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like unified way of doing</font>

690
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:01,780
that right now we do also sort of more

691
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:04,260
reactive way of looking at what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,430
we've described<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machine</font>

720
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,578
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network because figure out what's</font>

721
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,549
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it and like yeah we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

722
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:35,319
several<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like block this domain so</font>

723
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:38,890
stockbrokers some other users have have

724
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:43,329
the same there which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same fishing</font>

725
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:45,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kabang sort of things but then when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

726
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:48,160
follow it pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back you'll see more</font>

727
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">laptops so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more coming</font>

728
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,629
with what we are trying right now to

729
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,750
achieve with wires Barry where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

730
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:58,569
sort of like more correct it sorts of

731
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:02,619
information for us what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on in</font>

732
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:05,288
that particular time frame all the

733
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:06,819
appropriate machines well this can give

734
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:09,250
us in cities like yeah I mean

735
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:11,670
potentially we have also quite

736
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:14,650
suspicious file business suspicious

737
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:17,049
domains we built this<font color="#E5E5E5"> blacklist on our</font>

738
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:19,089
own text to this analysis we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can right</font>

739
00:38:17,049 --> 00:38:22,200
now use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for instance combined with</font>

740
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:25,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">those light or aspiring to take out more</font>

741
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:28,149
proactive it up like yeah so from this

742
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,890
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> this week we are this machine</font>

743
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then right now thanks to us where</font>

744
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:35,348
you can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the absolute ultimate</font>

745
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:39,970
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is definitely a benefit</font>

746
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:43,200
for not using this tools in isolation of

747
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,200
like combining all this different

748
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:50,010
possibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's cool possible</font>

749
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:55,020
q so doesn't like maybe we're not as a

750
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:56,450
sex line right now as we've tried to

751
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:00,119
combine all this source of information

752
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:01,529
with either the tax collector<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra like</font>

753
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,780
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see that we're right right</font>

754
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:07,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">now for a couple months with y squared</font>

755
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:16,970
which is already started doing that so

756
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:16,970
thanks to helpful to<font color="#CCCCCC"> speed up a bit like</font>

757
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:49,430
yes so uploading the binaries<font color="#E5E5E5"> to virus</font>

758
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:51,669
also this is a bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pro</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blahnik year</font>

759
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:55,729
because this is sort of what our

760
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:57,200
analysis when the floods forensics

761
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:58,549
collections have I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think serving our</font>

762
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,430
essence is like yeah we should solve

763
00:39:58,549 --> 00:40:02,960
supple bleeding as father we could we

764
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,328
potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> any way to have something</font>

765
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,489
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a virus or we just take much that</font>

766
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:08,960
we don't know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there so</font>

767
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:12,200
the pond this slide when this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

768
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,940
happening what was expected we don't

769
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">really have network connection so this</font>

770
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:19,989
is like other problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe lately</font>

771
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,989
during the rules sometimes

772
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:31,119
well if we don't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> by lunch in water</font>

773
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:34,140
so low prices the prophet saw some

774
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:37,869
certain titles it's not right now anyway

775
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,578
so don't do it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a regular basis we</font>

776
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:41,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">moral and these informations or the</font>

777
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:41,729
other

778
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,610
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in what your</font>

779
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:50,040
thoughts were on the news of rootless

780
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:51,660
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's coming out for OS X and</font>

781
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,000
how it might affect what a tool could

782
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,149
get from<font color="#CCCCCC"> P lesson system forward and</font>

783
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,730
things like that yeah so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

784
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:03,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">very interesting format they have so</font>

785
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:06,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on there which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

786
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">reverse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> capabilities I think yeah the</font>

787
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,030
assumption here is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Frances to</font>

788
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:15,480
do so that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't like always</font>

789
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:19,369
look for information so yeah the money

790
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,369
very interesting to see like it

791
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:38,640
so just kind of a Buddhist di or less

792
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:44,180
have you done any work with analysis of

793
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:49,339
I am at the volatility scram no really

794
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:49,339
this is more like for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> books</font>

795
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,470
so room and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm completely</font>

796
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:59,350
mistaken this tool rooms on a live a

797
00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:02,470
library sex machine is it not then

798
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:04,660
susceptible to advanced malware target

799
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:06,220
in the program itself and maybe cook it

800
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,770
into it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and manipulate in the day that</font>

801
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:11,890
comes back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> paint in it now in</font>

802
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:16,930
particular but not while we're it could

803
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:19,359
be possible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it what we was also</font>

804
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:21,009
possible to do is instead of running it

805
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,040
directly on the machine that's impacted

806
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:27,130
just to take damage of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and</font>

807
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,470
just like molten image and run from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

808
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,390
superb machine flowserve like easy to

809
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:33,399
circumvent the problem we have the

810
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:36,520
police<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that this as that's</font>

811
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,980
really something right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's very</font>

812
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">nice idea if you bought the release</font>

813
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,740
rhetoric also they have obviously

814
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,350
because it's open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source is wrong we did</font>

815
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:46,419
you give everybody good the code yeah

816
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:48,490
I'm and defeated like all this the way

817
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,110
it uses all this is sources of

818
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,439
information the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answers like public</font>

819
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:56,440
knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff during any finger to say</font>

820
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:59,430
magical services but potentially there

821
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,430
could be in all the work

822
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:10,780
go for rivals there are no<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

823
00:43:07,569 --> 00:43:10,779
thanks a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

824
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,770
you
