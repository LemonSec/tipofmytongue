exploiting smart locks because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought</font>

oh yeah android smart it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

57
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,480
such an easy project to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna be</font>

able to crack it<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight away give</font>

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,250
everybody an amazing solution and we're

60
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,720
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get around smart</font>

61
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">works very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easily but that wasn't</font>

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,590
the case unfortunately i'm just going to

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the painstaking testing</font>

64
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,070
that I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through so many of you have</font>

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,260
to because it wasn't the most moving in

66
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:47,140
the world but it was important that the

67
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:52,298
last I feel so I what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a smart box first</font>

68
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:55,958
or so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android lollipop 5.0 Android</font>

69
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:58,330
introduced a service called google trust

70
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,489
agents so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone you might not</font>

71
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,140
realize that smart boxing<font color="#CCCCCC"> get enabled</font>

72
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:05,380
but if you were to go through settings

73
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,298
security interest agents in a lollipop

74
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,220
they've got enabled a smart lock feature

75
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:10,650
and you took that you will they get a

76
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,890
new setting

77
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,060
in the settings security and smart locks

78
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,720
and this is what I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking</font>

79
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,450
about today<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so smart locks can be</font>

80
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,849
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to unlock a phone either in the</font>

81
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,970
proximity to a place a device or a

82
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:29,099
person's face so first of all I can go

83
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the most important part of this</font>

84
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,179
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it it's just going to be on</font>

85
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,379
the first slide but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important</font>

86
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,420
thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to learn about smart</font>

87
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:38,608
boxes they look absolutely no difference

88
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,369
to a phone that doesn't have a lock at

89
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:44,700
all so if I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> quickly flip over to my</font>

90
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:48,120
phone to go to the document camera you

91
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,399
can see here I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got my Android wear</font>

92
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,340
device paired up with the side of my

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,200
problem so we unlock the device here

94
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,780
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen just at the bottom there</font>

95
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,700
there's an unlocked block so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I</font>

96
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,290
kind of remember this now if you slide

97
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,429
up I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be getting yourself a</font>

98
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,379
nice piece 68 of the year if you end up

99
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,689
tapping the lock you're going to be

100
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:14,069
getting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice 1545 because that me</font>

101
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:15,959
invokes a lock so bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> news if anybody is</font>

102
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,909
trying to look into small it you know if

103
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,039
anybody sees is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile phone it really</font>

104
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,949
is as simple as that unlock the thumb

105
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:25,440
and slide you're in you're getting your

106
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,659
bonus at the end of the year<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you get</font>

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,550
in and you tap on the lock that's no no

108
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:31,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">rien put the smart block so it's very</font>

109
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,240
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy for somebody who's</font>

110
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:37,770
inexperienced and doesn't recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

111
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">stock to relocate on the phone so while</font>

112
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,380
that's one of the most important things

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,530
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of show really is</font>

114
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,690
well just do not tap this to not have it

115
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,270
always slide so if anybody takes

116
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:52,940
anything from it today we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

117
00:04:48,270 --> 00:05:00,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PC don't tap on this slide</font>

118
00:04:52,940 --> 00:05:01,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay don't stop just slide right so when</font>

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you first go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into setup your smart locks</font>

120
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,770
you can see here I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a few menus</font>

121
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,389
I'm going to stand back a little bit so

122
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,490
you can see it's a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> friendly</font>

123
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,949
soon as you straight away now going into

124
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,960
the smartlock menu it says screen up ass

125
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,000
word so my phone with a little

126
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">unorthodox in it is not that my phone</font>

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,630
doesn't have a small is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

128
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,729
it doesn't have a lock you can see

129
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,560
straight away there I am passcode on my

130
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,210
phone so that should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the first thing</font>

131
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that comes to your mind settings</font>

132
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,039
security passwords do their other

133
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:30,960
passcode unless it has the word none at

134
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,490
the top you're looking at up devices

135
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,340
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the smart look or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

136
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">similar so again down the bottom go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

137
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,810
the spotlight menu there there's no easy

138
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,610
way to have a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what's not locked</font>

139
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,919
somebody has from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone menus alone</font>

140
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,450
so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see when I tip tap the</font>

141
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,760
smartlock menu the first thing I'm

142
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,340
greeted with is either my smart my

passcode<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my phone or my swype code</font>

144
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,070
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't go in there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at it</font>

145
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:58,440
you have to do it manually yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

146
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,450
on to the next slide so I'll go through

147
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,029
the place aux first of all so when

148
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,349
lollipop was first introduced the only

149
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,450
way that you can set something to a

150
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:08,279
location without going into google maps

151
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,349
and you can either set your phone to

152
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">none not in the proximity of your home</font>

153
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:13,120
or your work location they were the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

154
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:15,639
two

155
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,400
available there's been a recent update

156
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">where anybody can geofence any area they</font>

157
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,388
they want so is everyone familiar with

158
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:27,669
the concept of<font color="#CCCCCC"> geo fencing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm so quite</font>

159
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,290
recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the past few years Apple</font>

160
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,719
and Google have been very helpful they

161
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,160
keeping an eye on everybody stones say

162
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,590
when you're on the internet you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

163
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,530
established 3g connection even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

164
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,448
are connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a Wi-Fi network it's</font>

165
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:45,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">uploading those Wi-Fi SIDS so the system</font>

166
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:46,960
ID and mac addresses to music and those

167
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,849
addresses are being used this or

168
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,039
crowd-sourced way so that if you walk

169
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:54,070
into an area so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go here I'm suddenly</font>

170
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,780
walk into starbucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Newport my phone</font>

171
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,360
knows that even without an established

172
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,369
GPS connection that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in newport which</font>

173
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,770
is really handy because that means you

174
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,479
can save a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of power and still get an</font>

175
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,190
idea of where you're going so if you

176
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,349
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send a tweet for example and</font>

177
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:11,680
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to type a location on to</font>

178
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,780
that even<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easily just send or</font>

179
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,460
having a lovely time in center parcs

180
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,520
today without having to establish your

181
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,719
gsm or your 3g connection your phone

182
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,820
will have a look around and look for

183
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">crowd-sourced connections and it'll be</font>

184
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,750
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work out where you are just from</font>

185
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:28,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">your Wi-Fi signal so great for users but</font>

186
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:31,060
it also enables this month or future to

187
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:33,309
be possible so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

188
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,889
you can see there with a trusted place

189
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,590
as home the first time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use it i'm</font>

190
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:40,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be reminded by the wall just</font>

191
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">jack you know last night when you're</font>

192
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,060
having a few beers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you thought that</font>

193
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're smart up is a really really good</font>

194
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,160
idea you come home now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've turned your</font>

195
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,950
lock screen off so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very helpful</font>

196
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in for forensic exam</font>

197
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:54,180
because the first if somebody foolishly

198
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,340
accidentally enables the smartlock

199
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,720
they're going to be reminded this is

200
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,039
what just happened on your phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

201
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,800
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you a bit of a reminder to</font>

202
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,300
say your phones are locking whenever you

203
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,060
come home now<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you sure you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want this</font>

204
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,470
to happen so unfortunately accidental

205
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,050
locks aren't going to happen quite so

206
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,330
often as we'd like so the second type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

207
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,150
block which I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to is a device</font>

208
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,010
lock so with the device locked you can

209
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,260
either do this with an NFC connection or

210
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,310
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth connection so my phone here</font>

211
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:25,320
you can see when I'm unlocking it is I

212
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,570
can't do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can I post all back if I</font>

213
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:33,780
go to the doc can hear you see my phone

214
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:35,789
is no case at unlocked so again you've

215
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">got the most unlocked symbol there you</font>

216
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:44,130
see that open padlock but as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

217
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:50,070
turn off my SmartWatch so if I go to

218
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:51,930
settings go down power off my watch you

219
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:59,670
can see just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how quickly one of these</font>

220
00:08:51,930 --> 00:09:01,260
logs will invoke shutting down and

221
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,689
immediately there's lots of Bluetooth

222
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,900
connection and I now no longer have a

223
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:09,750
lock on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is very very</font>

224
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,579
quick and a very media action and this

225
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,070
also works really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need the proximity of</font>

226
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,840
the device so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've set this on my phone</font>

227
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">so whenever I'm near my phone I don't</font>

228
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,200
want to be bothered by my lock screen

229
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,240
because I know it's on my wrist I walk

230
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,860
more than thought it's ten meters away

231
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,310
from i watch is going to kick in

232
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,640
immediately so forensic considerations

233
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,650
for this is for the

234
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,390
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular or if you're in</font>

235
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,400
information security for them I'm sure

236
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,220
that all of your phones in your third

237
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,380
whether Android iOS blackberry whatever

238
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,180
it might be all of your phones are going

239
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be locked by some sort powerful</font>

240
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,829
encryption so even if we were to do a

241
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,329
JTAG analysis on these phones if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

242
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,400
to do a chip off analysis on these

243
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,950
phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> or we're going to get is a lovely</font>

244
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,530
copy of all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypted data so why</font>

245
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">would we throw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away the opportunity to</font>

246
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,670
seize the key to the safe so a lot of

247
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are seizing all our phones these</font>

248
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,449
days but they're not seizing the devices

249
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be powering them up and other</font>

250
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:07,030
considerations<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can make as well are</font>

251
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,469
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'd recommend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this but if</font>

252
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,390
you were really clever you could pair

253
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,650
this to innovative medical device you

254
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,970
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be damn sure that it's got a</font>

255
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,170

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:19,599
pacemaker or insulin delivery system but

258
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,340
that is something you can do as well is

259
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,670
anyone familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> PT le that</font>

260
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:27,790
bluetooth low energy technology so<font color="#CCCCCC"> meaty</font>

00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:29,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">le is a small token device no bigger</font>

262
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,120
than a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two pegs piece for me the</font>

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,490
thickness of about two pound coins at

264
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,880
the most and BTW le there's a really

<font color="#CCCCCC">good paper written by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alex lest i</font>

266
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,840
believe the guys Davis and he has

00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:46,570
written a research study on on BTW i am

268
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,040
their uses so the idea with bt le this

269
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,580
is going to start really entering the

270
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,810
mainstream whereby if you're a virgin

271
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,940
galactic customer let's say you're

272
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably quite a premium to have your</font>

273
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,070
card every year so they're going to try

274
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:02,430
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sim these voices down in bed BTW le</font>

275
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,440
incident so that when you walk into the

276
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">flight down for the day your PT ally</font>

it is admitting an ID that<font color="#CCCCCC"> airport knows</font>

279
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,689
that you're there and then you receive a

280
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,130
text message that says what Wi-Fi

281
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,850

282
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:21,470
so you could technically hide a

283
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,850
bluetooth low energy device in your

284
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,830
ceiling you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have it in the wall</font>

285
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,230
you could have it in your television

286
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,090
anything at all you can pick that and

287
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,120
whenever you're in close proximity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

288
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,680
your formal or not so one of the biggest

289
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,480
examples I've seen for this and I've

290
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,489
seen at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least three people now and this</font>

291
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,770
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people's cars</font>

292
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,540
trying this is that if you were

293
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,939
investigating the criminal you have the

294
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:47,449
right warrants etc you could potentially

295
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">take day from take it to their car fire</font>

296
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,530
up the ignition bluetooth on the

297
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:54,860
cartoons on their phone unlocks see

298
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:57,350
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strong 256 AES encrypted</font>

299
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android device that all you need to do</font>

300
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">is take it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to their car turn the key in</font>

301
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,840
the ignition and it'll decrypt itself

302
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,210
for you why would we not want to do that

303
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,840
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> would we not why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would we throw away</font>

304
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:11,030
the key to the safe and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen people</font>

305
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,320
in quite senior places that you wouldn't

306
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,420
think would have this sort of thing

307
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,250
enabled but again the first time you

308
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,079
want a smile back the first thing you're

309
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,790
welcome with is would you<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to pay</font>

310
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,070
your advice to whether this be your car

311
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,319
whether it be or 0 to 360 or another

312
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,880
it's going to say hey it's not up to a

313
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,860
great idea what if you have this device

314
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">onto your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bomb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and originally I</font>

315
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,770
have an advocate sensible idea that

316
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">would just straight up drop into your</font>

317
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:37,939
protective devices interested devices so

318
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,040
the first thing you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> any oh yeah why</font>

319
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,170
not go on smart life banging it hit

320
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,610
trust of it and i've taken this people's

321
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,780
cars and I've shown them that their

322
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,850
phones doing this and they had

323
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,860
absolutely no idea that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

324
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,330
setting it but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we will call</font>

325
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,250
quite smart this because people would

326
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,329
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> like my code isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

327
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,100
anymore

328
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:57,738
turns off everytime<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go into the car</font>

329
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,360
now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to a vehicle or to a</font>

00:12:57,739 --> 00:13:00,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth device the first time you've</font>

331
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,749
added you have to confirm your<font color="#CCCCCC"> password</font>

332
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,079
now to add it to one of those trusted

333
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:07,610
devices so no longer will we be able to

334
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">just sort of sneak up some of these car</font>

335

339
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:24,349

346
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:38,299
screen off so again uses the set this in

avert only when they're from or than

348

355
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:56,029
wear is a really big thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really picking up this all Android way</font>

359
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:04,279
to go an extra device is that's so

360
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:07,729
saying there's a key to the safe I don't

361
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,799
know if it's there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the really</font>

362
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,269
big things I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know again unless you</font>

363
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:13,369
forensically analyzed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mobile phone</font>

364
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:16,220
you wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily know this for</font>

365
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:18,199
forensic examiners we need a DB access a

366
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,989
degree is the bread<font color="#CCCCCC"> and butter for all</font>

367
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:23,019
of our forensics involving<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android it is</font>

368
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:25,160
short<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an Android debug bridge</font>

369
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:28,339
enables us a connection into the phone

370
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,410
to push files profiles so basically

371
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:32,239
examinations will push in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> agent into</font>

372
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,219
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone which acts as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Trojan and</font>

373
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:35,600
that will then open a back door to the

374
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,089
phone speaking download your life

375
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,629
contacts calls internet history and a

376
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:43,730
various menagerie of other things but

377
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,420
one of the biggest things we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

378
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,389
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute</font>

379
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:50,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">ecor pkng are short for a backup manager</font>

380
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:52,399
and we can use that to pull an entire

381
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:56,810
backup of your home so that includes

382
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:59,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">appdata apks in key K cash all enabled</font>

383
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:02,930
with Android debug mode and who wore

384
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:05,570
very very very lovingly haven't bought

385
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,949
anything with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> smartlock there's</font>

386
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,449
absolutely no restrictions through

387
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:10,729
popping into the menus and enabling

388
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,800
anything good so if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got something</font>

389
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,990
with a smartlock going with a deep evil

390
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,540
plug it into your computer pair it with

391
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,370
your computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even if the code me</font>

392
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,899
kicks in at a later stage you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

393
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,180
to have unlimited<font color="#CCCCCC"> and relinquished</font>

394
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,410
access to that device on all the

395
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,260
versions of Android you could

396
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:30,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">potentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> privilege escalate or you</font>

397
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,959
could and pull a copy of their lock code

398
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:34,430
you could turn the opcode not again this

399
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,529
does differ from hence at the handset

400
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,388
but I think you'll all agree a really

401
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:40,220
useful feature that happen it's quite

402
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:42,680
surprising really the Google enable

403
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,470
smart locks but left the ability to

404
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:51,079
enable a DB on so i thought i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

405
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:52,940
useful so right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody so been</font>

406
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:54,579
thinking about if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't get into</font>

407
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,049
these marks and what good

408
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:58,569
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if they're on because I</font>

409
00:15:56,049 --> 00:16:00,369
was saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into the smartlock men</font>

410
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:02,439
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the person's passcode</font>

411
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:04,119
but the only indication we have that

412
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:06,309
they grow smart code at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment a</font>

413
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:08,290
smartlock<font color="#CCCCCC"> story is if you go into</font>

414
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:11,290
settings security and their pass really

415
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something other than none but if you</font>

416
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:16,029
can enable a TV that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really useful</font>

417
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:19,029
command you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> run which is easy shell</font>

418
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:22,149
doses so if I sort of zoom in here again

419
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:24,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to stand back a lot bit that</font>

420
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:28,959
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see written</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down here is a</font>

421
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:30,129
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> help line so the something that</font>

422
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,599
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really mentioned as a lot</font>

423
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:33,639
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing locks is there they're</font>

424
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,559
not infinite so if you imagine every

425
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">time you activate the phone the</font>

426
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:41,980
smartlock is like a very slowly dripping

433
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,268
again you start sending the text message

pause that block to keep on building up

437
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:03,750
so we've got two options<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we can</font>

438
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,120
either preserve the battery<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the phone</font>

439
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,589
because some time is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font>

441
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,789
device like the Bluetooth device keep it

442
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:16,689
charged keep the phone going but with

443
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:19,269
something like Android wear device like

444
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,980
the Moto 360 does anybody have a charger

445
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:24,519
for this in there are other than people

446

449
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,360
so you need to either separate the two

450
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:37,990
devices from each other big enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

451

freeze<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lock or you have to keep the</font>

documenting it very well google her

546
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,149
added an extra layer of trust whereby

<font color="#E5E5E5">come but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know all you would need to</font>

567
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then it in my testing is fire it up</font>

568
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:17,549
use a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android device or</font>

569
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,259
something else capable of broadcasting

570
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:22,800
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android network a wireless network</font>

571
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:26,760
and just emulate the same said

572
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,350
and the same sieve and password and

573
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,660
that's all you need it doesn't check the

574
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:33,899
mac address it doesn't check that you're

575
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:37,860
in proximity to anywhere too clever I

576
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,840
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when I did this I was all</font>

577
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,639
excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> I finally managed to fool it</font>

578
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,409
because a big part of computer forensics

579
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,970
is you know we have four principles we

580
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,100
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to abide to under the Apple</font>

581
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,350
principles we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have 21 not modify any</font>

582
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,909
evidence to if you do have to change

583
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,860
evidence so if you're going to remove a

584
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,360
cold or if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have to brute</font>

585
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,100
force the system in some way you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

586
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,469
know what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing three out to</font>

587
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,689
document what you're doing and for you

588
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,370
have to you have to make sure that the

589
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,890
OIC in the case is fully apprised of

590
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:07,199
everything that you are doing so really

591
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">if I'm is emulating hot spots and</font>

592
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,070
changing this and changing that I this

593
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,929
phone suddenly thinks it's been

594
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,550
announced house it's being sent to parks

595
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:17,700
it's been inhaling all day has been

596
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:19,470
buttons it being a be cited suddenly and

597
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,450
all of those wireless information

598
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,130
records all of that information about

599
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,410
where that phone's been for the last two

600
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,690
years whatever is all gone now it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

601
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:30,150
use so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't really an ideal method</font>

602
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,790
even if I could spruce the wireless

603
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">network but what I found was the most</font>

604
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:36,570
tricky thing was when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this and I</font>

605
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,250
got all excited I took the phone into my

606
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,649
office to show my colleagues what I've

607
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,560
done I into the Wi-Fi hotspot I do it

608
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:47,130
they go I'll up the phone will unlock

609
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:49,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">anybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to unlock ah and</font>

610
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,850
google them something very clever here

611
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,879
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where everybody in the room</font>

612
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,168
comes in really

613
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:55,809
love to get your feedback on this

614
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:57,459
because again this is quite exhaustive

615
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,959
my wife was watching a serious

616
00:23:57,459 --> 00:24:00,399
corporately little liars like images

617
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:02,889
boring as hell which is why I got the

618
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:06,339
time to do all of this testing but I

619
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:09,069
tried taking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless passcode to</font>

620
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:11,619
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sip out of the phone taking to work</font>

621
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:14,649
it's still knew that I tended towards a

622
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:17,228
trap it must be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gps antenna so</font>

623
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:19,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">i take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sim out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i take it to work is</font>

624
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:21,099
still knows a gps antenna<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

625
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:23,409
phone it can still get signal even

626
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:25,149
without sin carne said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i'm going</font>

627
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:27,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fall this unlock the phone in my</font>

628
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:29,918
house I let it see my wireless network

629
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:31,809
it unlocks visit things in stone I put

630
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,609
it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Faraday back I take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it all the</font>

631
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:36,039
way to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put it in our own a box</font>

632
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:40,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">close the body box ticket out friday by</font>

633
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:42,849
it knows what a prism I then<font color="#E5E5E5"> disassemble</font>

634
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the phone took out the wireless antenna</font>

635
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:46,899
took out the gps antenna put it in a

636

<font color="#E5E5E5">file a bag took it to work put in the</font>

bounding box<font color="#CCCCCC"> closed the box still heroes</font>

638
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:54,190
there so goodness knows how they're

639
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:56,019
doing this but it's been very clever<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

640
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,609
guessing it's got to be something to do

641
00:24:56,019 --> 00:25:01,509
with an individual time act on the

642
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:02,859
device so it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> either see and</font>

643
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:04,659
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing as well so I</font>

644
00:25:02,859 --> 00:25:06,728
just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to my experimentation I</font>

645
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:08,679
could turn the phone off I can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

646
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:11,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">back on I could unlock it with the</font>

647
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:13,539
antenna I'm detached so it doesn't know

648
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:15,849
what mass time near it doesn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

649
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:18,279
I've moved and it will still unlock in

650
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,749
my home I cannot replicate that if

651
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:21,909
you're always later in the office I just

652
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:23,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">cannot do it so there must be something</font>

653
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:25,779
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the accelerometer in the phone or</font>

654
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,940
gaps but I've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be honest this was</font>

655
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:30,459
I saw proof of concept and I could have

656
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,289
tested this today or the s3 that I was

657
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:33,639
using but that's not really a real-life

658
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:34,509
experiment because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

659
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:37,899
knows

660
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:39,429
just a base flavor of operating system

661
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:42,008
unless you're using something like a

662
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:44,799
Nexus device that has plain android

663
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:46,269
which could be tweeted ways documenting

664
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,729
this for an individual phone wouldn't

665
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:51,129
have done anybody any good so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

666
00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:53,289
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe way of doing this would be</font>

667
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:55,658
to take it to a person's home click off

668
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:57,129
their internet so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you're not</font>

669
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:58,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be able to receive a remote</font>

670
00:25:57,129 --> 00:26:01,119
wipe to command or anything emulate the

671
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:03,458
hotspot<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do it now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I don't to</font>

672
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:05,918
tell you why but it does not work

673
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:08,049
outside of somebody else I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got my</font>

674
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,579
twitter handle by email if somebody else

675
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:11,619
does work it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be gratefully</font>

676
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:13,690
gratefully gratefully received any

677
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:15,579
feedback a predator in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper or</font>

678
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:18,159
republish it somewhere for a much better

679
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:20,289
talk but you know all of this testing

680
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,999
that I did it didn't take five minutes

681
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,919
it took me several weeks and I'm how to

682
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:26,339
do this every<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning take it to Bristol</font>

683
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,539
with me unlocking work and just I just

684
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:30,999
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share all of my failures</font>

685
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:33,158
really in it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

686
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:34,719
know what not to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> really because it's</font>

687
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:36,909
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time really I don't want</font>

688
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:40,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">anybody else to go through it okay are</font>

689
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:42,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">you doing nothing happened okay so NFC</font>

690
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:43,629
ones that I don't really understand the

691
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:47,379
NFC locks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how they can be used a</font>

692
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:50,649
small box they do seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

693
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:52,928
pointless of redundant because if you if

694
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:54,728
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> block your phone most android phones</font>

695
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:56,739
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn off your NFC adapter</font>

696
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:59,349
so even if I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an NFC is after on</font>

697
00:26:56,739 --> 00:27:01,239
my wall I come home a wife scan the

698
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:03,789
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work because my</font>

699
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:05,979
NFC adapter is off so the only way i can

700
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:08,579
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would be able to use an NFC</font>

701
00:27:05,979 --> 00:27:11,679
adapter to enable a smartlock would be

702
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:13,639
has anyone seen in android lollipop is

703
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,350
especially

704
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,410
your kids you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in is like an</font>

705
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,570
admin and you can login is like a child

706
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:23,400
so I I didn't have enough devices to

707
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,830
test this on but I'd imagine you know

708
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,690
the login is another user that doesn't

709
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,820
have sudo privileges doesn't have

710
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:33,840
permission to your photographs doesn't

711
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:35,700
have permissions to your texts etc which

712
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,230
will then turn on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NFC adapter this</font>

713
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to really do that</font>

714
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,500
that's not a very practical

715
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,909
implementation it's not like just tuning

716
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,340
on your watcher starting up your car

717
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,560
it's a bit cumbersome but if you were to

718
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,379
do sir do anything like this again no

719
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,240
for my mistakes I went through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good 10</font>

720
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,590
20 points with of NFC tags before I

721
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,020
realize the peeling them off the wall

722
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,480
broke them so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do it</font>

723
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,150
get an NFC cloning application and clone

724
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,500
the NFC tag paste it back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> another one</font>

725
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then use that back in the lab</font>

726
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,010
because peeling them off the walls<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

727
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do a bunch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of good oh it's all</font>

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:12,840
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> things one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those you here which</font>

is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything I actually I haven't</font>

730
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,740
actually successfully tested it because

731
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,570
in everything I've got I don't have

732
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,330
because of the roms I'm running it

733
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:24,480
didn't give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> the option to add that</font>

734
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:28,230
secondary user because on every main

menu of the s3 that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested HTC m7 and</font>

m8 the NFC adapter was off at the lock

screen which I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bypass so</font>

738
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,840
it would have to be a reform that would

739
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,640
enable multiple users that secondary

740
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,899
user would enable the NFC tag<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

754
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,490
body protection and this one's very very

755
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:25,830
sneaky so this one you put as little as

756
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,360
forty four seconds of a game I've heard

757
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,240
you to tell you how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took there</font>

758
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,050
are many times I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up the</font>

bubble swords in methanol was throwing

761
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,430
it at 20 then 15 and 35 but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've worked</font>

762
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,440
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out exactly 44 seconds you rip it</font>

764
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,480
going to lock so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had on warning</font>

765
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,280
lock you have it in your pocket you're

766
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,260
walking around<font color="#E5E5E5"> all day you have any</font>

767
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,080
handbag whatever it might be you want to

768
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:56,430
use and that phone if you put down on

769
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,050
the desk when we've all been there you

770
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,610
come in what's the first thing you do

771
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:00,899
after you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been on site instance</font>

772
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,179
you've been carrying the phone around

773
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,040
you go I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go get</font>

774
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,860
it through so unless you can make up

775
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,810
room in 43 seconds I do not recommend

776
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,229
putting phones down on the table until

777
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:15,510
you check this not block settings again

778
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,550
it's worse case scenario but we always

779
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,260
know these sort of things but the one

780
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,570
good thing with smart box is if you're

781
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:24,150
examining in somebody's house and had no

782
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:27,179
body detection lock on it putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

783
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:29,760
down for 44 seconds or more

784
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:31,650
because every<font color="#CCCCCC"> other lock override the</font>

785
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,660
other see if you have my body protection

786
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,700
and a watch the watch is going to enable

787
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,950
the phone to stay or not if you have a

788
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,170
watch and location settings and watched

789
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,970
eyes but you still at home again it's

790
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to lock unless that for hours</font>

791
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:48,080
kicks in does that make sense Cecily I

792
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,939
didn't explain very well previously

793
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:55,350
another thing that isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> very helpful is</font>

794
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:57,810
that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a device it will</font>

795
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:59,669
after 30 days or so or remind the user

796
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:01,860
regardless of warlock they've got

797
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,200
whether it's on body on device face

798
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,270
unlock NFC it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remind that it</font>

799
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">said it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to usually one set this</font>

800
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:10,290
I know reminded you the first time use

801
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,989
if you are you sure you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use this</font>

802
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:14,460
lock so again people who accidentally

803
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:17,100
set it<font color="#CCCCCC"> or thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a really good</font>

804
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:21,530
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 days ago might change their mind</font>

805
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,530
at a later stage and the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

806
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,300
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> the smart box only work as</font>

807
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,880
long as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone is powered so again</font>

808
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:32,129
most police policies would be you see

809
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,130
the mobile phone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn it off exactly</font>

810
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,840
as the Apple fingerprint sensor works a

811
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,340
surgeon to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn that device off the</font>

812
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,020
fingerprint sensors going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn off on</font>

813
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,790
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone small box are going to turn</font>

814
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">off on an Android device it's an</font>

815
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:46,260
irreversible process if you turn that

816
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,880
phone off regardless of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font>

817
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,010
smart locks the smartlock blogs are

818
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,750
going to go because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

819
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,310
Gordon round and the small block is

820
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,440
going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely crapped out</font>

821
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,629
you can't use it anymore not until I use

822
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,660
it puts another successful unlock code

823
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:01,160
into it so that's again a little bit of

824
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bummer because it's only really good</font>

825
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,290
for instant response<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> live action</font>

826
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,970
taking all these devices because if

827
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,230
you're looking in somebody and you think

828
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,090
they've got a lock you really need to

829
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:13,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider you know have they got a lock</font>

830
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:15,290
on there is it going to lock if I put it

831
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,420
down on the desk just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just this is</font>

832
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:18,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">only going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the higher echelon</font>

833
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">criminals it's going to be the high</font>

834
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,620
rational a lot of jobs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can put</font>

835
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">this sort of thing into because the most</font>

836
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,120
of the time you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roberts techniques</font>

837
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:28,070
like cheerio jtag analysis but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

838
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,320
higher echelon of criminals if you have

839
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,210
a phone and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully encrypted even</font>

840
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,220
if we do a JTAG analysis on this or a

841
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:36,640
chip off analysis all we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get</font>

842
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:40,280
is a fully encrypted copy of their data

843
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,690
why throw away with you it's just it

844
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:46,430
just it just doesn't make any sense so

845
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:48,410
so finding so far so the phone has to be

846
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:50,600
on as I mentioned it will work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

847
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:53,270
Wi-Fi but it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something</font>

848
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,100
else with GPS on the cell tower your

849
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,020
phone will somehow know if it's nine its

this is where another wireless things

very basic level so the whole broad

00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:20,190
spectrum of devices can be used I've

937
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:22,680
just one dollar from first series is

938
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,180
hoping of any any NFC at all but is in

939
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,600
all the devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've got they don't</font>

940
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:29,069
the receiver in the phone so the actual

941
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,319
actual hardware that would read NFC

942
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:33,930
regardless of what type of NFC is is it

943
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,210
on a blog screen so i would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

944
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:37,950
another test of ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got a limit of</font>

946
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:42,149
research now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm no longer in the place</font>

947
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:44,430
but ironically so i could probably get

948
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,080
hold of a little bit more like time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

949
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:50,009
some of the test devices to test that on

950
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:52,920
but as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said the m7 DNA and the s3</font>

exercise until like that yes lucky so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

954
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:08,200
will just go through my my two cents

<font color="#CCCCCC">borrow never gone I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

park your car<font color="#E5E5E5"> explore now if never good</font>

959
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:29,319
to know that based on purely gps based

00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:31,900
on purely cell signals<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a nose it's</font>

964
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:43,240
interesting thing as well too so go with

965
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:46,420
the accelerometer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mention this</font>

966
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:48,399
with 44 seconds I did test this to death

967
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,500
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the table a train</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

968
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,450
the movement of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Train is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to</font>

969
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,820
keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's moving sometimes</font>

970
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:56,439
it's also I've tried it that way it's

971
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,390
not using the camera because I thought

972
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,579
maybe it's looking for darkness in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

973
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:02,650
pocket and then when you pull it out so

974
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:04,780
it won't work that way that way that way

975
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,329
that way that way that way any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its or</font>

976
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:09,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">more accesses you could put it down</font>

977
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:11,500
sideways on the table balancing or what

978
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,759
engine or still no it's it's set down

979
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,280
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where i went on the</font>

980
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,560
accelerometer route rather than you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

981
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,540
a flat level surface it can be at any

00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,430
angle<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've tried it slope upwards</font>

983
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,009
downwards left right up now it just

984
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,598
looks for lack of movement so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

985
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,430
if you wanted to you could put it on a

baby's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Romero and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still think it's in</font>

all this is this is what I like about

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> job is it's not necessarily overly</font>

all of the different things you can you

00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,210
can you can hack the phones you can rip

always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this oo left a CD you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font>

00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,900
not a million-dollar cluster to crack it

1043
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:09,990
yeah not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad idea but really sometimes</font>

1044
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,550
the best idea is a five-dollar wrench

1045
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,410
and this is exactly what likes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do tip-offs we can do</font>

00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:20,859
jtags to sometimes the five-dollar

1048
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:24,340
wrenches occasionally the best idea any

1049
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:31,390
further questions no no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I didn't one</font>

1050

more yes about European source the I

shall I forget the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name of it right in</font>

1052
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:37,570
the beginning I mentioned it was google

untrust agents so it doesn't have to be

1054
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,750
specifically small box they all of this

1055
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,580
testing was done<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a google</font>
