1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:11,980
hello hello hello

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,739
everybody's wide eyed bushy tailed I'm

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,340
great you're not me go it off no one's

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:20,019
ever ready

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,970
welcome so this all come very happy so

6
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:27,640
we're very excited to be here and a lots

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,038
of light touches and I've described the

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,409
stock and I've named it but it is

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,289
touching on elastics topic is searching

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:40,209
on the thin searching on heads it's all

11
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:44,980
about seeing data and what people do

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:49,449
that for I want to take you through the

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,940
story of Finn and heads and getting to

14
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:54,370
where you have dates are going somewhere

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,800
what you're doing with there but we can

16
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:02,828
kind of go with that the general idea

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:06,429
set behind that and it's fun so I start

18
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:09,790
with me stop me for this Brett I'm a

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,590
security analyst engineer now we'll

20
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,920
probably have manage people people told

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,990
me

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,060
people also call me the chief executive

23
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:21,490
brew maker some obviously secretary and

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:25,090
I've been doing and post that for just

25
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:27,039
under four years now it's four years the

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:31,360
preparations around that well I'm

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,930
enjoying so excited and the reason I've

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,170
been in this talk is it's nearly where I

29
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:41,170
started fin hits and also have a point

30
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:44,680
monitoring that's pretty much where it

31
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:48,119
began beyond some of the GRC and

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,729
compliance stuff I did years ago but

33
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,579
twice first start enjoying in terms of

34
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:56,289
technical stuff so I thought why not go

35
00:01:54,579 --> 00:02:00,788
back to my roots and talk about that for

36
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:03,850
45 minutes so I'm gonna start from the

37
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:04,600
beginning of my story and that's going

38
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:09,310
to be about

39
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:13,680
FEM and what Finn is a famous

40
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,680
file integrity monitoring it's about

41
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,349
looking after what's important to you on

42
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:24,209
a very selective basis it's a very

43
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:27,250
reactive skew to control it's not

44
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:30,909
something it's not preventative in any

45
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:34,209
way it's all about an internal kind of

46
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:37,629
events in-depth solution it's completely

47
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:41,349
stateful it's not particularly real-time

48
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:43,719
people can sell it as real-time but it's

49
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:48,939
a technical impossibility to really be

50
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:51,010
real-time well it's also really

51
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,108
adaptable because it's in that defense

52
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,459
in that solution you're able to put it

53
00:02:53,109 --> 00:03:02,769
anywhere effectively a monitor any

54
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:05,349
specific thing you want and how does

55
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:09,340
this work I suppose is the first

56
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:12,369
question and it's mostly to do with the

57
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:15,159
specific file attributes so that's

58
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:18,430
hashes us the content of configuration

59
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:21,418
files that's any kind of changes like

60
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,940
the capabilities on the file like the

61
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:26,260
security in writes or file and

62
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,489
monitoring those different changes

63
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:32,888
there's also ways for it to my turn

64
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,979
api's and things like that an AWS or is

65
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:40,689
your well that's a bit more advanced or

66
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:43,959
talk about that a bit later but i've

67
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:45,759
told you a little bit why Finn I suppose

68
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,780
why I've chosen vendors this time quiet

69
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:53,409
for me so why do people actually use FEM

70
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,979
and it's all about compliance more than

71
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,679
them

72
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:58,659
it's particularly when you're like an

73
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,989
SME kind of size not like a full

74
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:04,209
Enterprise your need to comply with PCI

75
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:11,530
DSS or an American company and I

76
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:15,879
survived with Sox necks a few other

77
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:18,599
shaunb acronyms but that's always gonna

78
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:24,250
be with the core of why people use it

79
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:27,099
it's kind of a typical hit solution for

80
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:31,600
any kind of SME as far as I

81
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,880
Stanny way and he gives them that those

82
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,940
eyes that the kind of movers and shakers

83
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,560
on their infrastructure based on their

84
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,900
baseline or the baseline they're

85
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:47,380
generating from this information on this

86
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:50,010
data and he does offer that Neal

87
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,380
real-time I mentioned before of course

88
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:56,230
technical impossibility but it gives

89
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,360
them that initial visibility and that's

90
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,810
why it's an important kind of

91
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,490
fundamental first step towards having

92
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:13,270
security controls and actually

93
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:16,270
investigating a bit further there are of

94
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:19,510
course ways around it as I saying is the

95
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:24,729
foundational control there are ways of

96
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:27,150
dealing with non real-time functions as

97
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:30,520
the deal with ways of dealing with our

98
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,650
dynamic functions and points moves

99
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:38,200
around more advanced controls or other

100
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:42,900
controls or in terms of process and

101
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:46,090
policies more than anything so the goal

102
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,570
I'm trying to aim for with Finn right

103
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,010
now

104
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:53,740
he's all about that kind of the film and

105
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,750
hits solution combined with somewhere to

106
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,510
actually aggregate and analyze your data

107
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,520
and that's why I've gone for the power

108
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,780
couple of was 'when l cuz they're pretty

109
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,299
much built for each other

110
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,630
and I'm really quite excited to talk

111
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:10,960
about each part it's really cool it's

112
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:15,550
really cool promise nobody's home good

113
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,109
I'm very excited about everything so

114
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,110
let's talk about that film solution I

115
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,450
talked about the head solution but that

116
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,430
was ooh head solution obviously had to

117
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:28,240
come from somewhere and that's evolved

118
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:34,020
from a open source solution called the

119
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:37,360
OSF which is open source it's set purity

120
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:40,479
rolls off the top without provide your

121
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,120
fears your registry monitoring

122
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,520
level one a train and he provides a

123
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,730
rudimentary rootkit detection based on

124
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,060
file names and hashes nothing too crazy

125
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:54,730
it's really small file actually it does

126
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:59,080
extinguishers it's definitely not an

127
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:01,990
ActiveX placement at all but it provides

128
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,630
those regulatory needs like I said for

129
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,260
the compliance once were as well as you

130
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,750
don't start

131
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,830
it's your start fen your fundamentals

132
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:16,000
are all there in this piece of camp but

133
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:17,770
why do a lot of people typically use on

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,430
a sec it's because a lot of people

135
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:24,039
already use or a sec it's open source

136
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,290
so people but typically looking out the

137
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,640
source of my eye it's free and not

138
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,870
giving back so here

139
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,169
well that's a completely different

140
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:36,690
argument but it is fundamentally really

141
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:39,250
really easy to use truely's develop or

142
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,140
documentation averse it's a bit

143
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,150
confusing we first look at it takes

144
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,460
about half an hour to understand the

145
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,010
installation process initially after

146
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,620
that the documentation is fine it's got

147
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:56,890
to have everything but you know it's not

148
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:59,770
very my need to be so what has that

149
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:03,430
changed into it's like resume the home

150
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:08,109
nation of all that's a fork of was that

151
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:12,850
that's the next evolution hasn't pull up

152
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:15,970
there but it's taken that base open

153
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:18,480
source software and they'll talk with it

154
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:22,210
and added extra features things like

155
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:24,340
open sky things like the tie-ins without

156
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:28,390
an updates relegation point an analysis

157
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:31,900
point but it's a combination of all

158
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:36,970
those features into a bigger wider

159
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:40,449
platform and the while it does provide

160
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:43,810
those features over set those fan those

161
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:47,530
hands that system monitoring it also

162
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:50,439
provides the features of open scout and

163
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,949
elk so open Skype is I was inspired in

164
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:58,110
the formulas management and disco

165
00:08:52,950 --> 00:09:00,930
as well as the more compliance focus

166
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:07,850
compliance tained configuration

167
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:07,849
management and access and discovery but

168
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:14,279
by providing that next level of features

169
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,459
and the actual easier ease that's coming

170
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:20,459
naturally from overset you're creating

171
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:22,739
really immediately almost powerful tool

172
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,989
for people to start working with to

173
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,449
start using to start changing to

174
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,920
configure into environment and again you

175
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:31,800
can go back to that baseline and you're

176
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,740
able to baseline further and further and

177
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,240
understand more a warrior environment

178
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:40,440
particularly when you're an SME versus

179
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:45,750
an enterprise and it makes it so so much

180
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,970
easier more than anything else as your

181
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,880
own SME and you're growing bigger and

182
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,850
larger Europe if you're not able to do

183
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,040
this kind of constant discovering you're

184
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:59,490
going to end up a bit behind with all

185
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,649
this is gonna be loads of one walked

186
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:05,940
after infrastructure and information

187
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:09,329
lying about that you will have time or

188
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,579
manpower or investment really so looking

189
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:14,000
to and that's may become a bit of stock

190
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:16,079
well they think you've got lots of

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,320
sticky stuff you can't get off your

192
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:22,500
hands you're blind to what you actually

193
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:26,190
really need to do and this is providing

194
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:29,160
those the first step that initial

195
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,690
investigation point or your

196
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:37,230
infrastructure for providing that

197
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:39,000
monitoring so how does it do is you know

198
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,500
it's a basic kind of agent server

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:48,089
communication three different processes

200
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:51,000
sis check rootkit D forgive me

201
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:56,339
forgetting the other process demon but

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:00,000
it basically exists as stole agent and

203
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,860
server calls back to manager that's

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,920
really manager so he conferred goes as

205
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,060
well you switch off and I'm from stuff

206
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,729
to Impala key on the edge

207
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:13,420
but now that you've actually got that

208
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:17,199
set up that initial part you actually

209
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:19,990
need somewhere to put all this logs all

210
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:24,670
these alerting all this telemetry day at

211
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:25,300
the old gathering it's there in the

212
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,370
middle

213
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:32,529
you want the top as well that's that's

214
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:40,690
that's the part it ties really really

215
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:43,000
tightly and without so what it's this

216
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:46,149
diagram itself is just giving you two

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,570
different options on the single mode for

218
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:51,459
masters or distributed nodes that's its

219
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,290
own thing that's just giving you choices

220
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:57,849
and design let's give you choice in how

221
00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:01,269
you want to set up a lesson but further

222
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,579
its hope right saying it's being able to

223
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:05,320
tie in with this day our group

224
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:08,979
aggregation platform and ask this

225
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,920
platform is immediately really really

226
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:15,940
useful and really really interesting

227
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,569
because it gets it gets you further and

228
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,240
further

229
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:22,479
what would sure towards where you may

230
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:30,180
want or need to be by providing the

231
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:32,680
place there's a few different ways

232
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,170
suppose you can look at architecture if

233
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,810
you want to talk about it you can talk

234
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,209
about some four hours maybe of a few

235
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:44,410
tequilas

236
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:46,899
few all the dreams but that's it's up to

237
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,430
you you can if you've got elastic

238
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,260
already can stand with that if not

239
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,630
sticking on single server look after

240
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,519
that so for new elastic histor and

241
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:57,069
stopping it went day or whatever type

242
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,899
again into that point there's a load of

243
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:06,969
different choices you've got that or

244
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:10,240
let's take deeper dive into what is and

245
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:14,620
it's a combination of three main

246
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:18,550
projects or last search long staff and

247
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,790
cabana elf okay and that's about a

248
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,609
search

249
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,819
analysis engine which is our search

250
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:29,930
you've got long stuff which is a suicide

251
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:32,150
pipeline project for digesting that data

252
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:34,760
sending its receiving it all the good

253
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,290
stuff and then you've got cabana which

254
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,960
is all about visualization actually

255
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:44,030
interacting were there on a GUI web

256
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:47,870
interface level and that combination is

257
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:50,900
an immediate start to the whole dinner

258
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:57,230
aggregation platform makes it pretty

259
00:13:50,900 --> 00:14:01,459
pretty cool pretty interesting and oh it

260
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:03,440
does this is by taking that log stash so

261
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:07,090
the pipeline the data the server-side

262
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,880
pipeline creation white takes an end

263
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:13,490
does whatever you need staring up at one

264
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:16,939
takes into our search then you can try

265
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:20,240
to think about it's not it's a it's

266
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,490
beautiful it's really easy you may have

267
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,940
noticed this is another one where they

268
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,440
do vertical beats as well that's an age

269
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,840
of these kind of setup so if you can't

270
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,730
send the logs necessarily but you still

271
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,610
want to receive them or gap with them

272
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:37,790
you can pull hey agent on the endpoint

273
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:41,420
pulls them off or sends them wherever so

274
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,250
all the options that human get really

275
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:47,240
specific with speeds is working at

276
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:50,540
metric beats for metrics get all it

277
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:55,370
beats for order box I can get generally

278
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:58,370
far beat or any kind of file log if you

279
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,290
want they're all available so I will get

280
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,900
an idea but that will be going straight

281
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:07,089
to my search rather than viral and

282
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:12,740
typically you can still send it by and

283
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:16,810
long staff or its new you know that

284
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:25,940
that's your choice and the pipeline's on

285
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:28,640
log stash are really really I don't want

286
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:33,350
to say complex and I want to say lengthy

287
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:35,000
they're available to configure you've

288
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:38,120
got lots of different choices of how you

289
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,640
want to take that data uses a language

290
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,769
called crop to be able to take the data

291
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:47,410
in editor change it

292
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:51,589
label it however you want it to be

293
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:54,560
labeled plus into a search and then put

294
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:57,320
it that your index of many endeavors

295
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,599
you've got answer is available so

296
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,920
identifiable you know what it is you

297
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:10,820
know where it is hidden know what it is

298
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:14,029
well why help why do people choose out

299
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:17,660
well I chose now I've chosen helpful of

300
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:21,200
some obvious reasons so ties into was

301
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:24,170
they obviously but it is overall just a

302
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,800
powerful powerful powerful search engine

303
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:29,930
it's got lots of choices in terms of

304
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,319
architecture design in terms of how you

305
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:35,660
want to set it up and destinies there

306
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,420
you can make lots of different choices

307
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,449
in however you want set it up you can

308
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:44,689
centralized or decentralized there's

309
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:47,870
options for you wanna look at identity

310
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:50,449
or user behavior its options for how you

311
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,519
want to store that data you want to get

312
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:54,319
rid of it up to six months all the

313
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:59,230
options in that all the difficult kind

314
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:01,519
of options but there's also so many ways

315
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,810
of analyzing that data as well

316
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,839
especially when you're gonna end you've

317
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:07,119
got pro bono that and talk about

318
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,349
statistical analysis you can talk about

319
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,438
Israel just looking through the day you

320
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:17,629
can talk about machine learning talk

321
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:23,000
about what's the name leaves its

322
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:25,270
timeline is a narrow platform it's

323
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,230
analyzing data over longer time varies

324
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:31,160
don't remember natural name for it

325
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:33,710
unfortunately but there's so many ways

326
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,740
of using those there if you look from it

327
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:41,299
can monitor it however you like as well

328
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:45,270
completely little choice but again

329
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:47,220
it's Razoo and elk they are those are

330
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:50,879
those two pieces stuck together

331
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:55,620
it's got Wu Zhu on those end points on

332
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:58,490
the manager or separately or with out

333
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:02,779
like Oh showing to the potential choices

334
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:05,309
and you've actually reached that goal a

335
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:07,919
combination of the two you've got a

336
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:12,330
platform for security analytics or

337
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,220
starting to independently view you can

338
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:18,949
actually start moving forward with we've

339
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:23,730
got and you've got the whole kind of

340
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:30,720
three main points can do the data so can

341
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:33,750
rich it ionizes navigator bar pair so we

342
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,399
would have say an aggregator you've got

343
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,929
your data in that place you've got your

344
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:39,239
day - in the centralized or

345
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,700
decentralized architecture it's

346
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,549
available to you now you can combine it

347
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,460
with all the other data like oh say you

348
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:50,100
can change and annotate and labelee how

349
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,240
you need it - it's all your own choices

350
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:58,110
I apologize if this isn't too technical

351
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:03,270
of a deep dive but I'm touching on a lot

352
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:06,570
of points here and what e makes

353
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:09,929
available to people is if you don't want

354
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:14,820
to learn sequel or you don't want to do

355
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:16,140
a full scene on yourself you still want

356
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,559
to start something like this don't wanna

357
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,620
try something out this is what this is

358
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,600
on what I'm telling you is you can move

359
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,059
from this to a more powerful platform

360
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,629
which is something that we're talking

361
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:33,270
about so I'm quite excited about that

362
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:36,360
but you can from that aggregation from

363
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,649
putting your data in this platform this

364
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,350
analytics platform you can actually

365
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:45,000
enrich it using those pipelines as I

366
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:47,879
mentioned before you're able to buy bees

367
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,660
you're able to push in all this together

368
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,650
you also

369
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,020
thoroughly import threat intelligence

370
00:19:51,650 --> 00:20:02,000
and things like that right into your

371
00:19:54,020 --> 00:20:04,570
data and he really lets you take a lot

372
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,220
of work from your analyst

373
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,540
my assumption at this point is that if

374
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,760
you're getting this far you're the least

375
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,800
high in the person that's looking at it

376
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,610
but that's not always the case

377
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,440
deficit is the case but there's plenty

378
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:23,240
of options for taking a lot of the work

379
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:25,550
off a lot of the enrichment so when I'm

380
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,610
saying about identifying and assigning

381
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:32,120
all our dates with labels and been able

382
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:34,699
to look at the easier that's what the

383
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:40,629
pipeline comes in that's the initial

384
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:43,820
part of the initial touch point and and

385
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:47,090
not only does it you can do it manually

386
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:50,240
you can do it in the animal file that's

387
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:52,340
how you live your line or you can do it

388
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,170
in a visualization if they offer this

389
00:20:52,340 --> 00:21:00,010
now and it's fantastic and it makes it

390
00:20:54,170 --> 00:21:05,330
very very easy and thoroughly recommend

391
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:11,060
good weekend sit in get approved then

392
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:13,220
hop on the Obama dashboard and throw

393
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:22,820
together a few highlights

394
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:26,780
it's been fun right from there saying a

395
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,490
lot you caramelize it it's a fantastic

396
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,440
platform we've got lots of different

397
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,920
options you've got lots of different

398
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:40,390
options in machine learning is difficult

399
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:44,120
analysis as I said before but it's also

400
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:49,880
got lots of built in features like

401
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:52,610
monitoring like a PM like the choices

402
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,770
you can make in the data you want so the

403
00:21:52,610 --> 00:22:01,719
Daisy don't want you can drop anything

404
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:02,990
archive it it's a great platform for ECI

405
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,090
because

406
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,279
it gives you the money - I could hear

407
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:11,570
all that data but it also lets you make

408
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:14,809
the choices of great got the PC idea to

409
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,939
the spot that aside still compliant

410
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:20,450
don't worry about that my absolutely is

411
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:25,130
if something this is just compliance and

412
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:30,169
the features that with it allows it to

413
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:33,080
be very controlled if you need it to me

414
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:35,480
it allows you to do things like some

415
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,059
single silo it allows you to do things

416
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,750
like a buck a buck

417
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:44,418
they also like to because of that this

418
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:48,830
to be a nature so I won't fall he allows

419
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:51,919
you to easily orchestrate it and thrown

420
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:54,529
over on another note throughout another

421
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,929
knows where you need it to be doesn't

422
00:22:54,529 --> 00:23:03,159
take a lot it's really really

423
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:07,340
straightforward but from this platform

424
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:10,610
we've then got some like took it over

425
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:14,500
now we've got something really really

426
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:20,389
cool and interesting I a big fan of

427
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:24,649
Cole's apti Metron this is a much much

428
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:29,840
larger platform this part of it is ELQ

429
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:32,779
which is why I've got here but it's CAF

430
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:36,320
gates Hadoop it's a lot of advanced

431
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:39,890
stuff suddenly in your face but this is

432
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,918
more towards I full Enterprise people

433
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:46,010
dedicated to this work this is where

434
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:49,100
this is takes what's up its welcome

435
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:52,059
understand just want to get running but

436
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:56,510
of course it's a much larger platform

437
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:59,600
but it builds on top of that puffle has

438
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:04,279
been built with the zoo and elk and give

439
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:07,100
you a much larger choice of how you want

440
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:11,600
to aggregate it are going to rip here

441
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:13,428
there's lots of law built in enrichments

442
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,610
as well things like threat intelligence

443
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:22,390
things like how a metrics

444
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:24,530
reggae and once you got my initials and

445
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:27,440
set up all the way

446
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,510
sold they're available in front of you

447
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,120
it's easily manageable

448
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:37,190
I say easily it's easy for me might be a

449
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:40,100
hard few subjective right but it's that

450
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:43,100
next level you come from Bob head to pop

451
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,949
in X brain you've got four months

452
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:49,449
instead of two it's fancy

453
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:53,090
it's real it but he'd provide it's a

454
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:56,470
massive framework in comparison to who

455
00:24:53,090 --> 00:25:01,879
was who and health and that platform its

456
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:05,110
befall from Cisco open sock it's become

457
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:10,160
this platform when it was taken on by

458
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:13,070
Halton works I want to say don't quote

459
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,669
me on that moment believe it is and they

460
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:19,299
took it to a completely new level

461
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:21,980
completely new idea set a new framework

462
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:27,379
but they've really built on some

463
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:30,980
incredible stuff and it provides four

464
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:35,870
key ideas it's all about in Richmond

465
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:37,520
it's all about right it's all about rich

466
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,260
men it's all about getting logs in their

467
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,230
Slovakian network with stuff in there

468
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,799
it's all about threat intelligence for

469
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:48,679
Maine it is what drives its framework

470
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:51,100
but it takes in Knuffle it takes and

471
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:55,309
things like pickups things like logs

472
00:25:51,100 --> 00:26:00,159
things like sticks and taxi it's all

473
00:25:55,309 --> 00:26:07,250
available there in front of you right

474
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:10,429
there and immediately available and so

475
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:13,580
so interesting I'd recommend giving it a

476
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:18,440
go if you get a chance it's a fantastic

477
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:21,918
framework but what it's done is it's

478
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:25,460
taken that core elk it's taking that

479
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,980
core aggregation platform and gone ok so

480
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,160
how do we make this easier and this be

481
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,160
easier and this be easier

482
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:36,990
isn't very careful not to over engineer

483
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:40,630
obviously but you're taking all these

484
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:46,870
functional parts plan together into this

485
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:49,600
beautiful got these layers really good

486
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:53,409
stuff so you takin it from a car okay

487
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:58,209
normal beef burgers like that triple

488
00:26:53,410 --> 00:27:00,220
decker stacker delicious cheese feelings

489
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:04,030
on top Oh beautiful

490
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:06,190
especially when younger but you're

491
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:09,250
taking it to that new level is what I'm

492
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:11,799
saying cause you've got so many people

493
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,780
behind and working on it got lots before

494
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:15,760
working out don't get me wrong but this

495
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:18,070
is dedicated for what scoot analytics

496
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,460
there's lots of different use cases and

497
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:25,928
ideas driving it that aren't necessarily

498
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:27,669
driving elastic so it's important way of

499
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:29,860
where you want to be almost time you

500
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:34,960
wanna invest in that and decide what you

501
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:37,209
need that but the fact that it's this

502
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,360
dedicate is huge a massive framework

503
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,820
means it's much more extensible it's

504
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,370
built for the ideas that is built for

505
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:48,340
friends that cannot see analysts still

506
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:51,459
for cyclist is built for people doing

507
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:53,860
the work rather than somebody who needs

508
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:57,340
an understanding of data analysis and

509
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:59,949
how to actually configure that and you

510
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:04,209
mix it takes a lot of the work or

511
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:13,770
guesswork out of the work for the

512
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:18,340
analyst and it's really really fantastic

513
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:21,370
but how does it work it's got it's

514
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,860
pretty simple as well it's got the key

515
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:28,678
kind of pilot serves the data ingestion

516
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:31,149
so it's giving you examples of miffy and

517
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,980
generic telemetry but of course you have

518
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,600
things like the farm these things like

519
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,260
the optometric these things that

520
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,500
logstash

521
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,570
still there and available to you but

522
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,659
when it's aggregating it it's pulling in

523
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,990
every single thing you can't and put in

524
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:48,300
that

525
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:51,670
place or distributed and those are brain

526
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:54,399
but then when it's going from there is

527
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,620
going into an enrichment in Richmond

528
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,040
isn't optional

529
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:02,620
like elastic is going to be able to

530
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:06,550
ideate it with all these kind of Trent

531
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:09,219
Arjun stops it stays taxi a user import

532
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:15,879
understanding the data is what's driving

533
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:18,970
that driving that in richmond is your

534
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,730
analyst your threat intelligence people

535
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:25,390
all these all this work is actually

536
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:29,500
going into versus it just being advanced

537
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:31,750
on a day like then from there you can

538
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,550
take similar so that's it can take the

539
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,360
alerting the monitoring obviously

540
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:40,870
they've got a bit more mature in terms

541
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,570
of how you might alert on monitor as in

542
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:48,070
its naturally love for a right stick in

543
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:57,399
jail and stick it in emails texture if

544
00:29:48,070 --> 00:30:00,389
you want that's you what form needs your

545
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:04,300
input by less and your understanding or

546
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:08,260
work going into it so it's important to

547
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:10,570
know understand your data it's important

548
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:13,360
to map your infrastructure it's

549
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:15,370
important to baseline understand their i

550
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,060
know these can be really really

551
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,790
difficult

552
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:23,800
you've typically Carmack's their

553
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:27,940
workload but it's about trying it's

554
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:29,710
about finding out it's about knowing

555
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:33,850
what you do would know understand and

556
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:35,980
think in those risk decisions how you

557
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:40,719
want to approach these things well les

558
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:43,750
amis I've seen don't have security

559
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,520
strategy so filled have that we need to

560
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:50,140
comply how do we get there and you know

561
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,410
Razoo and elf is a perfect time place

562
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:56,320
for PCI DSS it's easy this reform is

563
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:57,180
simple and he gives compliance and then

564
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,550
he just

565
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,940
lock it up put it away still do this

566
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:06,060
thing still compliant

567
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:08,940
no really well you do need to actually

568
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:12,840
analyze and look at the data but there's

569
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:17,040
no definition of how regularly beyond

570
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:18,840
daily its long-standing what you're

571
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,620
buying and selling as well what your

572
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:25,620
services are a business what do you get

573
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:29,100
in terms of data or what do you give

574
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:33,000
into there and knowing so if you're not

575
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:36,480
so you know use it for and against

576
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,590
yourself whispers in terms of securing

577
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,750
infrastructure and the standing yet but

578
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:44,610
it's important that you user rights

579
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:48,300
available to you and you've got these

580
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:51,000
platforms available to its once you got

581
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,470
past that understanding stage once

582
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,610
you've got past our baseline stage

583
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:58,140
you've then got something to work with

584
00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:01,469
because something available to you and

585
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:05,550
you're able to do something with it it's

586
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:11,060
important we do because it's a rel is

587
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:13,379
ready for you nine months no no this

588
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:19,710
particular interest within this s log

589
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:21,900
out over random house observer except to

590
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:24,420
you or anybody's gonna break in your

591
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:28,100
structure so it's probably best that you

592
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:33,270
use it first you're followed here but

593
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:35,429
it's knowing what you're after how to

594
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:38,670
get out there and how you gonna do it

595
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:42,290
and this is just one of the choices of

596
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:47,640
analysis and analytics and aggregation I

597
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:50,879
mean more than happy to feel that little

598
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:54,060
questions but it's up to you it feels

599
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:58,170
euro British questions to understand

600
00:32:54,060 --> 00:33:03,649
what you've got what you need and what

601
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:03,650
you're going to do with it all but Frank

602
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:07,699
you
