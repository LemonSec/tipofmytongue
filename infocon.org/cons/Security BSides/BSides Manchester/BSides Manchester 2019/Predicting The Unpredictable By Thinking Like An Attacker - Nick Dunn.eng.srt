1
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:11,570
okay hi everyone that's Azure probably

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,540
expecting as the title of the talk if

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:20,630
that's not a talk you're expecting you

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:22,880
could be in the wrong room then I'm done

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,419
I just explained how I originally got

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:30,229
into this I was originally a secure

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:34,960
software developer who spent quite a bit

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:38,180
of time working on online banking and

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,910
eventually found out sir I could have

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,760
ferb far more fun and more interesting

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:47,900
time of my life by breaking things

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:51,019
instead of building them and criticizing

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:54,170
or the bubbles work and I moved into

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:58,850
this security consultancy area of the

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:10,760
Gansu work on penetration testing what a

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:13,610
threat modeling can't review so a lot of

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,180
this knowledge it's being coming out and

18
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:19,789
how is pop comes from nuts original work

19
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,640
and design and developments and things

20
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:25,520
I've learned over the years a threat

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:31,550
modeling and general security

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:35,360
consultants it's what we're going to be

23
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:39,770
talking today is served a quick review

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,340
of conventional threat modeling moving

25
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,619
on to then when that sort of threat

26
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,890
modeling isn't enough and more needs to

27
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:51,440
be done and a bit of a process

28
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,729
Georg checklist to recognize when you

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,890
should move into that area

30
00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:01,679
and when to try something difference a

31
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:05,490
number work through an example and this

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,350
question is obviously at the end before

33
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,209
I starts how many people have done

34
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:17,970
threat modeling before and how many

35
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:20,220
people are new to it okay so this first

36
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,230
part then it'll be a review for some of

37
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:30,150
you and an introduction for the rest of

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:32,429
you and before I start although I'm

39
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,510
calling this the conventional way you're

40
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:39,030
a standard method there is there's no

41
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,250
accepted definite right or wrong way to

42
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:45,090
do it there's a few different approaches

43
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,010
but what we'll discuss first is the the

44
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:53,700
more conventional way that it's usually

45
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:56,160
done and you can all read a lot faster

46
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,420
than I can talk so I'm not going to read

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,739
out every line on every slide but

48
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:07,679
essentially threat modeling so it's

49
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:10,109
conceptually simple it's gaining some

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,230
general idea of what can go wrong with

51
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:16,799
the application and then moving on to

52
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:21,510
look at how you can fix or further

53
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:23,400
verify that's and hopefully reviewing

54
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:28,709
what you've done in improving for next

55
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,480
time and the way we're going to talk

56
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:35,069
about this the more conventional way of

57
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,700
doing is is to sit with some subject

58
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:41,160
matter experts and do what we call

59
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:45,298
decomposing the application so generally

60
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:48,269
start with their view of how the system

61
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:52,769
works and there are architectural

62
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:55,109
diagrams and logical diagrams before

63
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,849
moving on to doing your own diagrams to

64
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:00,389
model how data flows through the

65
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:04,010
application which usually highlights

66
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,010
where things can go horribly wrong

67
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,319
that that will lead to you coming up

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:17,209
with your threats which you will them

69
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:21,519
ranked or quantify and our data flow

70
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:24,700
diagrams are builds of these components

71
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,870
again it's def very different from the

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:31,039
conventional sort of architecture

73
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:35,570
diagram it's quite user friendly easier

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:38,180
someone who understands and as you model

75
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:43,849
the data flow you should end up with

76
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:48,470
something some ranking of threats on

77
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:51,110
these lines where we have the stride

78
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,960
method that's conventionally used will

79
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:58,850
be spoofing whether you can impersonate

80
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,320
another user or another system tampering

81
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,560
for anyone has done that a lot of

82
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,669
penetration testing is one of the

83
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,979
principal areas we find a lot of fun

84
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:16,250
modifying the parameters attempting to

85
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:19,810
cause unexpected behavior and by

86
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:26,600
unexpected I do mean things going wrong

87
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:28,850
repudiation generally we'd look at

88
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,680
falsifying an audit trail making it look

89
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:34,600
like something's happened at us and

90
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:38,350
satins or concealing previous activities

91
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:41,300
what a good example of that would be

92
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:49,850
making a cash withdrawal appear not to

93
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:53,090
have happens information disclosure is

94
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:55,310
fee of the excessive exposure or

95
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:59,239
exposure of information you might not

96
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:03,380
have wanted end-users to see of

97
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,890
sometimes it can be details or sensitive

98
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:10,850
data about a person or you could apply

99
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:13,580
the same principle equally to technical

100
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:18,340
error messages that reveal data about

101
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:20,469
buckin systems denial service

102
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:25,719
is going to be something that you I'm

103
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:29,770
sure all familiar with and finally the e

104
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:32,560
for elevation of privilege where an

105
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,260
attacker would attempt to get higher

106
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,479
levels than they should be permitted to

107
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:44,789
have so carrying out activities normally

108
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:47,740
for an administrator but without sir

109
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:53,380
obviously without pre possessing the

110
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:56,200
admin login so that's all a bit abstract

111
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:59,290
I appreciate her for anyone who hasn't

112
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,909
done it before that sir probably needs

113
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:06,280
an example to make things a bit more

114
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:08,229
concrete so this is going to be far

115
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,179
simpler than something you would do in

116
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:18,550
real life was if you consider earth a

117
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:21,039
completely fictitious online the service

118
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,610
that sells things to people I'm sure you

119
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,889
can imagine the sort of thing we might

120
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,400
speak to the developers and come up with

121
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:33,669
some high-level diagram like this that

122
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,229
shows how data flows through the system

123
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:40,599
and through different trust boundaries

124
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:44,680
so for the user interacting any data

125
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:49,590
that comes from them would be untrusted

126
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:52,270
data moving from their across and to

127
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:57,969
what should you do militarize zone

128
00:07:52,270 --> 00:08:00,490
within where the application sits would

129
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,830
that interrupt them further with stuff

130
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,250
on the corporate network again data

131
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:08,770
flowing both ways and you'd have

132
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,200
different levels of trust they're

133
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:17,889
applied to these this data that flows

134
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:19,599
through and you would go on to use those

135
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:25,990
stride techniques that I've just been

136
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:28,180
talking about to build up this ranking

137
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,760
of threats that could come for a system

138
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,370
like that is all be

139
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,260
because sort of things they come up with

140
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,400
if you are threat modeling any web

141
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,770
application although if you'd had two

142
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,228
days to do it when you just handy then

143
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:51,490
that you'd obviously have questions

144
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:54,370
asked of yourself now there's a lot of

145
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,540
advantages and disadvantages to this

146
00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:00,460
approaches it works very well for

147
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:04,800
conventional web applications networks

148
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:06,910
applications and mobile applications

149
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:13,109
because really that's what the process

150
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:15,459
was originally designed for that's

151
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,250
because the process has been designed

152
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,380
for those sorts of applications it

153
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,870
generally gives very good results in

154
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:31,510
terms of coming up with a test plan or

155
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:33,550
coming up with design issues as you can

156
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,640
see I'm saying it works well most of the

157
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:43,359
time and that implies obviously this

158
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:46,140
times it doesn't work so well and for

159
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,400
certain types of non-standard

160
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:51,340
applications it can cause you to go

161
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,939
through this process just assessing it

162
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:57,640
as if it was a standard web application

163
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,400
you you can introduce blind spots and

164
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:08,560
realize if you do it that way you may

165
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:11,439
have missed issues so if we take a look

166
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,170
at nonce some non-standard

167
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,370
sort of compromises that have happened

168
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:20,140
over the years don't know if anyone's

169
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:25,810
familiar with the story of Barings Bank

170
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:31,720
and Nick Leeson he at some point in his

171
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:34,420
life got used his special privileges to

172
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,020
set up something on the production

173
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:42,550
system called error accounts eight eight

174
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:44,620
eight eight which was used to hide away

175
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,630
an error by one of his

176
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,480
stuff that of course the bank to lose

177
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:51,180
several million pounds from someone

178
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,190
choosing the wrong option

179
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,510
[Music]

180
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,910
Potiphar betrayed I should explain

181
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,760
bearings Bank were at this time one of

182
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:03,219
the oldest merchant banks and the Wills

183
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:12,970
and had the Queen as one of their

184
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:17,230
clients Percy started to take riskier

185
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:19,540
and riskier trades to truck what like a

186
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:23,830
gun boy trying to pay off his debts with

187
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:26,230
one big sort of when he gradually built

188
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:30,310
up bigger and bigger losses that we're

189
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:34,600
all being moved to this accounts which

190
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:36,640
was basically the results of giving too

191
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:41,230
many permission the wrong sort of

192
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:44,290
permissions to a single user and a sort

193
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:47,860
of luck of auditing of on that's lack of

194
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:51,760
correct auditing not sure trucky of the

195
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:54,130
trades correctly and you could argue a

196
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,990
minor bit of social engineering because

197
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,670
he did could convince a couple of IT

198
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:04,660
people that this was a training accounts

199
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:06,729
upon the live system it does beg the

200
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,709
question of why the people being trained

201
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:13,630
would that account were gradually losing

202
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:15,580
millions and millions over a period of a

203
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,820
couple of weeks but that results

204
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,650
eventually caused the banks who

205
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,130
announced losses of eight hundred and

206
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:26,770
fifty million pounds in the 90s when

207
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:30,040
that was a lot of money and it was the

208
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:33,990
closing of the bank I mean more than

209
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,990
exists now obviously it's still a lot

210
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:42,420
in the case of Stuxnet much more recent

211
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,420
I'm sure more of you have heard of that

212
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,370
it appeared from deconstructing the

213
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,220
exploits that had been deployed

214
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:54,720
afterwards some what appeared to have

215
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:58,000
used publicity photos of the president's

216
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,840
walking around the nuclear facilities to

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,550
identify which versions of Windows were

218
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:10,660
being run in the facility which had then

219
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:13,329
led to a situation but you could argue a

220
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:18,459
lack of good desktop policy and locking

221
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:22,510
down had resulted in USB keys being used

222
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:24,960
to transfer exploits so to those systems

223
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:29,430
which were then used to attack

224
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:35,140
centrifuges used for the uranium

225
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:40,599
refinements on those systems at that

226
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:43,270
time the word the whole idea of

227
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,839
exploiting the hardware to refine the

228
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,790
uranium was a bit of a new thing it was

229
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,880
the first sort of exploit I think anyone

230
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:57,430
had developed for these Siemens uranium

231
00:13:51,880 --> 00:14:01,560
refining devices in the case of the

232
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:05,319
Estonian online services those immersive

233
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:09,339
DDoS against government's systems and

234
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,260
banking systems there where in their

235
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:13,110
case it caused a major problem because

236
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,890
the majority of the population

237
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,790
overwhelming majority did all their

238
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:22,569
interaction with government services

239
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:26,170
online and almost the entirety of their

240
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,690
banking online but there was a further

241
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,930
unforeseen consequence of that but some

242
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:36,130
of the banks shut down their system thus

243
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:38,650
in order to reconstruct things during

244
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:42,250
the DOS attack which cut off their

245
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:44,530
access to ATM machines which left the

246
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,510
majority of the population of Estonia

247
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:56,530
unable to use an eight

248
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:59,230
no more rules which sure it's easy to be

249
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,760
wise after the event but I think there's

250
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,790
a few things there that wouldn't have

251
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:06,370
been cool to in the conventional threat

252
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:14,709
modeling diagram and on stride process

253
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:19,030
with just looters and I'd started

254
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:22,120
thinking about this over the last 18

255
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:23,829
months or so I first looked at been

256
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,250
asked to develop a threat model for a

257
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:32,260
mainframe and then been taken down this

258
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:35,230
whole routes inside my heads okay if you

259
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,450
got fire extinguishers in here are they

260
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,660
the sort that would damage the hardware

261
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:42,520
or your login visitors what's the

262
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,500
temperature control system is the

263
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:49,360
temperature control system accessed

264
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:51,220
online and I found myself getting down

265
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,110
this route more and more as we started

266
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,020
solid goods

267
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:58,870
medical devices and machine learning

268
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:01,540
systems where we find yourself looking

269
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,270
at some quite specialized or

270
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,980
unconventional bespoke systems that were

271
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:12,670
then interacting over a perfectly normal

272
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:20,590
HTTP channel or similar with regular

273
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:23,170
conventional systems and I sorta wanted

274
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:27,310
to think about how we could do this in

275
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:30,400
threat modeling process there's a guy

276
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:32,489
called Nicholas Nassim Taleb who wrote a

277
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:38,430
book called the Black Swan

278
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:41,370
that's talks about the some of the other

279
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:44,310
unexpected events that can have certain

280
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:50,440
catastrophic or serious consequences

281
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:53,540
that were unforeseen at the time and he

282
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,420
gives a sort of simplistic example that

283
00:16:53,540 --> 00:17:00,050
a turkey that's being fed every day by

284
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,050
humans might think hypothetically

285
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,060
because it can't think really butter

286
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,680
while these humans are amazing they feed

287
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:10,040
me every day this is a really good

288
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:12,589
process things are working out well and

289
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:18,470
the turkey proceeds along those lines

290
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:21,349
until Thanksgiving arrives and suddenly

291
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:29,680
sees yeah there was an unforeseen event

292
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:32,570
there and so I started to look at these

293
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:36,110
sort of set of steps we could use to

294
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:38,659
decide when we needed to use not just

295
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:42,860
the normal strike enumeration what maybe

296
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:46,220
bolts on a few other sorts of things

297
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,919
that we could live gotten I will be

298
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:55,730
putting Jeff with some wiring for all of

299
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:59,750
this later but in general I decided if

300
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:04,240
the target utilizes particularly new

301
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:06,440
concepts or non-traditional technologies

302
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,490
when some of the stuff we've just spoken

303
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,980
about medical devices machine learning

304
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:18,410
or quantum computing thats feeding its

305
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:22,280
data into a conventional system a system

306
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:26,240
that uses specialized hardware like a

307
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:29,660
mainframe or a quantum computer or you

308
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,540
prefer nin uranium something that

309
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:40,490
depends heavily on processes as well as

310
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:43,730
technology then you've probably got a

311
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:46,070
reasonable case for stepping out for

312
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:50,420
doing destryed process in the normal way

313
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:56,659
but then stepping outside and taking a

314
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:59,000
look at what else could go wrong the

315
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,220
reason of I've got more detailed

316
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,840
checklists that I'm going to put online

317
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,640
together a clearer more detailed way

318
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,830
to go through this book we'll use a high

319
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,480
level version for now to keep things

320
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:16,870
short and simple but the reason for

321
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,150
using checklists pilots generally have a

322
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,840
checklist before they take off because

323
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:25,270
it's a nice simple way of getting

324
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,939
competent skilled people to to make sure

325
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:32,770
that nothing's missed and that a process

326
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:35,409
runs smoothly for trivia fans the World

327
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:40,840
Health Organization introduced surgery

328
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:43,179
checklists surgeons in 2009 which

329
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:47,039
reduced death rates from noir point

330
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:52,600
eight percent to one point five percents

331
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:55,629
um the other sort of scary part of that

332
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:58,600
is as well as reducing death rates there

333
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,970
were other sorts of things that you'd

334
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,090
like to avoid as a surgeon like swabs

335
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:09,669
being left inside people the wrong limb

336
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:15,520
being amputate seeds that was the

337
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:17,649
general aim of the checklist so for

338
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,809
death sorts of process I thoughts of

339
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:22,408
things like you should be looking

340
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:27,220
whether it has a physical attack surface

341
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:30,820
we've already mentioned medical devices

342
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:34,240
earlier and one of the reasons I had to

343
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,610
step outside the process there was not

344
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,100
only because these devices are plugged

345
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:42,370
into a human at one ends on the data

346
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:47,168
flow diagram which is quite sobering

347
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:50,080
when you're assessing it's there's also

348
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:52,600
the whole thing of is logging being

349
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,570
stored on removable media could you

350
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:59,949
deliberately mistreat someone and then

351
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:04,809
remove the logs can a laptop be plugged

352
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:08,380
into it in order to services and is that

353
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:10,750
going to cause issues or I'll have

354
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:17,289
someone to operate the machine in a way

355
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:19,740
that it normally wouldn't be we've

356
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:23,110
spoken earlier about sir

357
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:27,120
new experimental technology centers of

358
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:30,399
quantum computing or machine learning

359
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,530
how sure are you that the data you beam

360
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,650
that's coming out of that system is

361
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:39,040
correct how sure are you that the data

362
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,810
going into that system is correct do you

363
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:46,960
even know that it's been built and

364
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:49,810
programmed properly and of course as

365
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,480
we've said earlier there's always with

366
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:56,950
these systems a channel running between

367
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,650
the convention system but then the new

368
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:02,590
sort of super Withey system that's going

369
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:11,110
to save the world what Choppers further

370
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:13,419
the chances of compromise algorithm

371
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,100
opacity was of course a thing I've

372
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:19,090
thought of it into when we've been

373
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,800
looking at machine learning systems do

374
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:24,820
you even know that the result is

375
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:27,879
corrects all those results correctable

376
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:36,010
can they be correct seeds is there even

377
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:37,900
any way of fixing system afterwards for

378
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:41,470
banking like what I've talked about

379
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:44,980
bribe blackmail here it's it's sometimes

380
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,870
seen in the financial sectors an

381
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,460
additional risk that someone could hire

382
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:55,979
some temporary stuff and just bribe them

383
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,980
to take photos or pass on details

384
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:02,350
misbehave generally if it's often a lot

385
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,930
cheaper than going through the firewall

386
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:13,360
Lords doing a generally technical

387
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:17,130
methods we've already spoken about

388
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:21,570
Stuxnet mainframes and quantum computing

389
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:24,670
or other things that depend on some

390
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:27,010
place trust heavily and some control of

391
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:30,880
their environment with some external

392
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,929
piece of hardware so that's an

393
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,779
additional threat

394
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:42,220
belugas the cost of running a quantum

395
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:44,879
computer is enormous so if someone is

396
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,759
able to compromise that yeah the

397
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:51,908
environmental temperature controls that

398
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:54,159
can cause huge cost overruns for someone

399
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:56,649
they can cause the other things we've

400
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,470
spoken about about incorrect data that

401
00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:07,299
you may not even be certain as in

402
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:09,240
corrects both cops were another sort of

403
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:12,940
thing that we'd consider it in an entity

404
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:16,299
in terms of the mainframe issue there's

405
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,570
been times in the past where people have

406
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:22,539
backed up every night's or every week

407
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:26,320
and had plenty of backups ready to

408
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:28,570
restore the system but then it's been

409
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,340
burned down in the same fire that burned

410
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:34,330
down the rest of the building they were

411
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:36,029
destroyed the system that was protected

412
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:40,779
[Music]

413
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:43,019
and there's always as we've said with

414
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:46,179
with the point of view of hiring

415
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:50,740
malicious insider or bribing someone

416
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:53,409
it's important Seleucus the path of

417
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:58,899
least resistance how would I do this if

418
00:24:53,409 --> 00:25:01,090
I was an attacker there's a common thing

419
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:03,158
and threat modeling and pen testing

420
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:06,939
where you're told to think like an

421
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:09,820
attacker which is possibly not the most

422
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:13,809
helpful thing gift you've got to imagine

423
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:15,610
how an attacker thinks I think it's far

424
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:18,220
more helpful to look at that an

425
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:22,360
attackers objectives and go through some

426
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:26,080
checklist of what data do I have what's

427
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,879
the value to that of that being sold on

428
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:33,970
what's the value to someone of that

429
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:36,939
being corrupt seeds can the DOS attack

430
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:39,639
benefits someone else as in online

431
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:42,129
gambling where I used to work for a

432
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:44,600
company that did online gambling and for

433
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:48,100
them they would have a job

434
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:59,090
attempts roughly once it's why someone's

435
00:25:48,100 --> 00:26:00,919
along with a ransom demands so if we

436
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:06,470
look at this ways of putting this into

437
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:08,810
practice we'll look good sir it songs us

438
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,780
to model a machine learning system we

439
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:15,320
can see fall sense of those criteria

440
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:17,750
whether earth there are some processes

441
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,689
and procedures taking place in the

442
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:24,520
machine learning system that effects the

443
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:27,280
behavior of external systems holding

444
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:35,720
important data could be medical data

445
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:38,420
financial data that's us those critical

446
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:42,530
things of algorithm opacity we really

447
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:46,940
don't know whether or not it's generally

448
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:49,040
working as it should do and so in that

449
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,930
situation if we were attempting to look

450
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,260
at something like that we would go

451
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:57,410
through this process of following the

452
00:26:54,260 --> 00:27:01,840
stride model and then looking for

453
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,840
whatever else we could do afterwards

454
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:09,050
that falls outside the nonce the regular

455
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,970
strides thickness I appreciate that may

456
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:19,820
look a little bit intimidating at first

457
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:22,880
sites but the real things to be aware of

458
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:28,040
here as well what we've thought about

459
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:30,500
about boundaries funds separation of

460
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:36,530
different systems that are interacting

461
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:39,140
as part of a very critical process for a

462
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:42,500
supervised learning machine learning

463
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:44,660
system that be some training data that's

464
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:48,910
fed in initially to help them make its

465
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:54,100
decisions and produce some models

466
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:58,140
you-you that could and then that model

467
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:02,159
will be used to secure

468
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:05,760
actions against live data which will

469
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:11,250
then result in some control of some

470
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:18,120
external system which could be for

471
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:20,490
detection systems face recognition but

472
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:24,679
generally the real point is that this

473
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:28,430
external system has been controlled by

474
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:31,620
separated on little-understood processes

475
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:33,780
that frequently fall out sent to the

476
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:38,610
remit of other companies or third

477
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:40,290
parties or some weird process of data

478
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,830
gathering that you may have had little

479
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:49,020
control over or may not have thought

480
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:51,090
through completely so in the case of

481
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,220
machine learning systems as I said

482
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,830
there's a few things that would lie

483
00:28:53,220 --> 00:29:02,010
outside the typical stride method of

484
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:04,080
doing it's which could expose features

485
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:10,650
in inverted commas that an attacker

486
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:13,350
might want to make use of things we

487
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:19,160
typically look at from an adversarial

488
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:23,370
point of view of ML is bias that could

489
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:34,200
come from bad data about processing of

490
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:35,820
good data and unintended features that

491
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,550
could assist in attacker

492
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:42,240
I appreciate some of that's a bit

493
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:48,810
abstract if you imagine a company this

494
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:50,280
has so many sort of feedback messages

495
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:53,730
coming in that there's a machine

496
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:57,270
learning system set to answer them and

497
00:29:53,730 --> 00:30:00,840
to send make an appropriate response to

498
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:03,450
a person if someone found out what the

499
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,220
right words to use to cause that system

500
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:08,690
to automatically give refunds

501
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,200
that then that's the way this sort of

502
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:14,090
thing could cause a financial loss from

503
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:24,590
interfering with the model or taking

504
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:25,779
advantage of features of the model the

505
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:30,340
threats

506
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:30,340
sort of specific to the training data

507
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:37,039
it's huh sir how's the training dates

508
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:39,649
have been set up correctly has it

509
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,009
causing the model to behave as you would

510
00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:45,498
expect it feeling as it should do

511
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:49,039
there's a a well-known example the US

512
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:51,470
military is thought they devised a

513
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:55,789
system that could recognize tanks from

514
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:57,830
aerial photographs which worked sir with

515
00:30:55,789 --> 00:31:02,029
hundred percent accuracy on the training

516
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:07,009
data but sir around two or three percent

517
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:09,559
accuracy in real life it had been

518
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:12,980
trained entirely with to recognize tanks

519
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:15,110
in photos that had no clouds and so it

520
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:18,440
was just saying tank whenever it saw a

521
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:27,918
photo with no clouds and no tank when it

522
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:30,649
saw a photo with clouds so was it good

523
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:35,899
thing to be aware of a few looking at

524
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:41,268
this thing in terms of the production

525
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:43,939
data thus there are known instances of

526
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:46,299
people looking at anonymize data and

527
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:50,149
[Music]

528
00:31:46,299 --> 00:32:00,039
being able to identify real people from

529
00:31:50,149 --> 00:32:00,039
its own personal data under a KC surfer

530
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:05,119
like or the certainly the possibility of

531
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:07,880
bad day to deliberately introduce to a

532
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:15,780
training process

533
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:18,780
not function correctly I realize I'm

534
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:21,440
running over Beth so I'll just quickly

535
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:24,270
run through that certain all of these

536
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,230
using the checklist can be applied to

537
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:30,510
other sorts of systems and the mainframe

538
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:33,560
there's the issuer on the communication

539
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:36,510
channels the specialized technologies

540
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:39,800
and as for quantum computing and medical

541
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:42,180
devices similar as viruses issues

542
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:45,659
basically there's different ways of

543
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:49,850
extending strides I'll put the slides

544
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,850
online so you can go to those links

545
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:55,160
quick summary threat modeling is great

546
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:03,150
don't assume it's fallible just because

547
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,010
it misses attacks just look for where

548
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:08,490
you shouldn't reiterate to do things

549
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:10,770
differently next time definitely do not

550
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:14,690
focus on technical attacks to the other

551
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:18,629
solution of deciding whether you choose

552
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:21,300
online but the world to decide to allow

553
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,910
many people to interfere with things in

554
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:28,580
other ways always a dunya methods to

555
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:28,580
what you're looking at any questions
