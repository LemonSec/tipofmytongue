1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,220
you

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:10,100
my name's Gavin Johnson Lin this is my

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,570
presentation from Bill data bryggen so a

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,610
quick introduction to myself Who am I

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,650
currently I work as an offensive

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,590
security specialist at siege sage is a

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:22,369
company that writes accounting software

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:25,698
as a 4100 company I mean a software

9
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:27,740
developer for a very long time career

10
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:30,980
spanning about 20 years professionally

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,830
as a software development the last I've

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,750
I've also been working at siege before I

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,070
worked at siege security wasn't a very

14
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,370
big factor in the software development

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,440
that I did as I could see it be could

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,239
became more important I started doing a

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,190
lot more security

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,129
I support local security groups I see

19
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,440
squid or spy always try to attend

20
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:54,110
I very much tried to work smart all the

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,468
time so I tried to find ways to be more

22
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:59,269
efficient and I'm a total imposter

23
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,710
certainly as a software developer I

24
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,300
always felt like it and impostor

25
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,039
he believes to say I was pretty good

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,450
software developer but I was never quite

27
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:10,340
sure that a believer so quick note on

28
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,299
the presentation its kind of split into

29
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,979
two pieces the first part is how I got

30
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,180
onto we're a team and the second part is

31
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:23,299
a few of the interesting things I've

32
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:25,520
done since I've been on a red team as a

33
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:29,299
software developer I felt like in kind

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,310
of a roadblock so as I see a unit

35
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,970
develop for a long time I wanted

36
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,799
something different

37
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,420
certainly as a software developer I

38
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,310
didn't just do software development I

39
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,310
like to so understand the areas around

40
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,880
it I like to try to look at improving

41
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,350
testing and improving user interfaces

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,479
learning patents thing about

43
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,009
architecture DevOps that sort of things

44
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:50,720
so I like to understand the areas around

45
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:53,000
it but none of those really did it for

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,369
me that much I want something new

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,659
something exciting at the time I thought

48
00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:00,140
changing direction I want to be a

49
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:01,310
software architect and so soft we

50
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,899
already take this kind of a natural

51
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,799
progression from a software developer a

52
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:09,049
lot of the same skills it's a kind of a

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,880
high level job there are much less for

54
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:12,379
fewer software architects out there and

55
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,310
it's a bit more interesting you tend to

56
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:18,019
get to do more interesting things

57
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,020
I don't see I wanted more money as well

58
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:24,060
so I thought how do I get these things

59
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,429
usually when you work for a business you

60
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,160
tend to get push the in a direction by

61
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,290
the business maybe not intentionally but

62
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,000
you you work they they want you to do

63
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,280
certain languages they wanted big things

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,780
in a certain way if they decide to

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,340
change the language they're using on a

66
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,930
project then you can have to learn that

67
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,610
language and go in that direction I

68
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,680
wasn't really what I wanted I wanted to

69
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,239
choose find my own direction I wanted to

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,160
be very clear on my own direction

71
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,750
so I thought I need some goals they have

72
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,280
them do this so January 2017 I made a

73
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,800
plan obviously I was still working as a

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,610
software developer so I continued my

75
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,780
dear job I decided to stop working on

76
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,269
the improvement of the software

77
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,800
developer side and work on other things

78
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,230
that would move me towards being a

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,600
software architect I wanted to sprinkle

80
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,980
some security in there it looks like

81
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,620
there's a lot for a sprinkle of security

82
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,569
really the the security aspect was to

83
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,060
because to be a software architect

84
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:19,890
certainly where I work there's a

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,480
security requirement you need know a

86
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,048
reasonable amount about security you

87
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,910
need to run threat modeling sessions you

88
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,620
need to understand security implications

89
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,209
both on a software development side and

90
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,040
kind of a devops side and and all that

91
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,780
sort of stuff so it would be useful to

92
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,859
get me there so understand a lot about

93
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,570
security so to do that I wanted to start

94
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,690
going to watch sessions I c-squared

95
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,608
sessions it's a certification called CSS

96
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,340
LP which is the certified secure

97
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:49,019
software lifecycle professional so

98
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,310
that's very much aimed at software

99
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,019
development lifecycle and put in

100
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,850
security in there so obviously that

101
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,739
leaving quite well with what I was doing

102
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,390
so it was elements of software

103
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,549
development it's a software architecture

104
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,429
that sort of thing but lots of security

105
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:06,480
in it also where I work there there are

106
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:08,970
security champions so in software

107
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,820
development teams they have software

108
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,730
developers software testers and software

109
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,228
architects architects you'll often take

110
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,890
on the role of a skier you come in for a

111
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:21,870
project and this means that they're

112
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,460
essentially pushing security for the

113
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,250
software that that we're writing on that

114
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,580
team so I wanted to take a market at

115
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,479
four

116
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,628
and become a security champion on the

117
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,830
software architect side it's very

118
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,419
difficult to get a job unless you've got

119
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,859
experience doing the job but it's

120
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,289
difficult to get experience doing the

121
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,669
job unless you've got the job so I I

122
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:44,009
said about trying to get some experience

123
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:47,849
and thought how do I did that so I

124
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:50,280
talked a few people and they said so I I

125
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:51,900
asked and they said yes he will give you

126
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,210
some some work as a software I could

127
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,440
take which kind of stood me it was that

128
00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:00,180
simple I just had asked okay so I got

129
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,719
these some interesting projects on the

130
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,280
Software Architect site I want to do a

131
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:07,590
piece around blockchain which was very

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,030
Universal and also blockchains got

133
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,619
elements of security units for that that

134
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,190
was really useful towards the security

135
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,190
objective as well

136
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,770
so what did I learn from all that so

137
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:18,360
obviously there was a lot of food in

138
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,180
there so I learned a lot of security act

139
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,969
on from a point where I was working as a

140
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,969
software developer on a payment based

141
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:29,219
project so it had some security in name

142
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:32,550
but I was by no means doing lots of

143
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:38,520
security work all the time and went from

144
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:40,319
that to actually hey I don't want to say

145
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,580
know lots about security I think there

146
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,110
obviously lots of people they know a lot

147
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,880
more about security than I do but

148
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,909
certainly from where I'd been I knew a

149
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,319
lot more about security I also looked at

150
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:51,029
different ways of learning so that this

151
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,240
is part of the kind of working smaller

152
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:56,969
stuff that I did so I try to look at

153
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,770
different ways of being better at

154
00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:00,210
learning things one of those in the

155
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,039
inner top layers and each so that it's

156
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,068
kind of a space reputation tool it helps

157
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,300
you learn by repeating things different

158
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:09,870
intervals to try and get them into your

159
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,629
brain I tried using different mediums so

160
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,400
I was reading books on the subject I was

161
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:16,199
using things like plural science ivory

162
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,359
which are video based

163
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,210
Pluralsight I'm a big fan of that was

164
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,500
probably the first kinda online course I

165
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,299
did around security was on field site I

166
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,129
also I kind of immersed myself in

167
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,210
security really so even in the car when

168
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:32,520
I was driving the word I listen to

169
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,960
podcasts in the car about security so I

170
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,330
was just doing security stuff all the

171
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,380
time

172
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,919
also in terms of different ways of

173
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,120
learning and I was trying to think about

174
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,349
more technical ways of getting things in

175
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,000
hebron so i was looking at they're

176
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,260
purely thrown from google searches have

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,900
you have you learned things more quickly

178
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,250
things like memory passes mind palaces

179
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,530
all sorts of different techniques of

180
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,300
learning lists of things came up and

181
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:01,650
that was really useful and those sorts

182
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,300
of things continue to be useful now one

183
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,609
of the big things i then was the most

184
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,889
acutely i did the more I enjoyed it so I

185
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,020
really got to enjoy a few you started

186
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,760
become passionate but security I was

187
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,020
doing more and more and I think I was

188
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,820
just kind of it and worse than it and I

189
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:21,440
was because I liked it so quick note on

190
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:24,719
the certification I did so I started

191
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,000
doing revision for it in January 2017 I

192
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,910
passed it in December 2017 so that's

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,380
kinda year like I said I'd look at

194
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,580
different methods of study so it'd be

195
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,320
really helpful not just in terms of

196
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,590
security but I think I've put in about

197
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,690
an hour of the ADIZ with a bit and that

198
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,299
was something like 350 to 400 hours

199
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,280
across a year which looking at it now

200
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,860
makes me think I actually work really

201
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,659
hard on her I don't think I'd realized

202
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,660
that other time but that's like ten

203
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:56,550
weeks of full-time work right so that

204
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:59,039
worked on putting on certifications so

205
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,530
obviously I've gone from a point of not

206
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,270
actually knowing much about security and

207
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,280
I wanted to get to a point where I I

208
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,919
knew lots about it and how you get there

209
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,030
the only way that made sense for me was

210
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,120
the kind of structure that a

211
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,650
certification gives you sort of that

212
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,150
structure was really useful and really

213
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,388
necessary for me which is why I chose to

214
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:20,969
do the certification it was also

215
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,960
interesting that by telling people I

216
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,680
work with that I was doing this

217
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,750
certification the personal security work

218
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,310
in my direction so I was actually

219
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,690
getting more experience while I was

220
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,800
doing the certification so I wasn't just

221
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,390
getting knowledge I was getting

222
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,940
experience of using that knowledge as

223
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:39,479
well which was really useful so recap on

224
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,880
the timescale

225
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,930
January 2017 I stalled on the CSS LP

226
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,339
December 2017 I passed it October 2018

227
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,529
this time I'd been getting more and more

228
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,550
experience at work more and more kind of

229
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,630
security work had been coming my way

230
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:57,000
[Music]

231
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:59,430
really I was thinking am i slim and for

232
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,680
software architecture maybe I want to be

233
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,270
a security role so I set myself a

234
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,000
different goal I changed my mind

235
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:11,160
I told myself I want the pure security

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,390
role by October 20 21 I I came to fill

237
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,279
in the details of how I was gonna get

238
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:18,540
there and December 2018 came along and I

239
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,260
would be advertised a lot of security

240
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,630
roles so I went through this cane and

241
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,580
mental a roller coaster of I'd really

242
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,200
like one of those jobs and I have enough

243
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,360
skills or experience for those jobs but

244
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,649
really like one of those jobs but really

245
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,130
I there's no way I'd get one of those

246
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:38,390
jobs and I eventually convinced myself

247
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:44,220
to apply for the job and somehow got it

248
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:47,640
again go back to impostor syndrome so

249
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,470
takeaways I got from this it was really

250
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,140
hard work I put a lot of effort in but

251
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,550
it was certainly worth the effort the

252
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:58,589
fact that I enjoyed the subject so much

253
00:09:53,550 --> 00:10:00,510
me the hard work and worthwhile women

254
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:02,130
smart was also really useful to me now

255
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,660
yeah I think I've got skills that I can

256
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:09,029
now he's going forwards and not just

257
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:11,339
security skills and for me it was a read

258
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:13,140
into the industry so again going back to

259
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:16,500
this how do you get a job that requires

260
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:20,310
experience without having experience so

261
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:23,100
I painted being in the dev role I've

262
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,449
done some security work I push myself to

263
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,089
learn more and more one get the skills

264
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:33,209
and get the experience and eventually

265
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:36,480
led to it - we into a security job so

266
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:39,029
switching the beam part of a red team so

267
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,000
I've got an L played over there again

268
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:44,430
bisaya been in the job six months I am

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,420
by no means some fantastic pen tester or

270
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:51,569
red teamer so just looking at the team

271
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,579
sides of the job so we're not 100% red

272
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,920
team

273
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:58,248
the job I did a lot of pen testing as

274
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,759
well it's interesting to look at the two

275
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:03,739
sides of pen testing and red teaming and

276
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,499
see that they're just totally different

277
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:10,309
parts of the job so pen testing is a

278
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:12,769
part of a job where you're eating

279
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:15,920
because like as you like you can find as

280
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:18,019
many vulnerabilities as you can and it's

281
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,709
it's more kind of tick boxes I've tried

282
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:22,939
all these things and red teaming is it's

283
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,258
very much different there's a lot of

284
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:26,269
planning to it there's a lot of thought

285
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:29,059
goes into it there's a lot of and if we

286
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:31,040
want one one way in what happens if

287
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:32,719
things go wrong we want to be nice and

288
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,849
quiet and then and not get caught doing

289
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,309
things so it's really interesting to

290
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,809
look at the the two sides that are very

291
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:40,610
different parts of the job but they're

292
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:41,929
also useful to each other I saw a lot of

293
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,759
the things I'm learning on the pen

294
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:46,759
testing side is very useful on the red

295
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,949
team inside a lot of the thoughts are on

296
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,049
the red team worthy I have an impact on

297
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:53,809
on how do you think about pen testing as

298
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:55,489
well so it's doing very different kind

299
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:56,929
of sides of the same coin but it's it's

300
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:58,489
it's really interested to be part of

301
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:59,839
that and it keeps the job really nursing

302
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:02,509
as well so you said you're not doing

303
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,529
just one job certainly not doing one

304
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:08,299
thing over and over again so under some

305
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:12,199
of the things that I've done that I've

306
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:15,350
really enjoyed as part of the job there

307
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:17,779
was a red teaming a piece of red teaming

308
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,589
work that we wanted to do and we were

309
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,739
planning for him

310
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:25,100
and part of this work we were planning

311
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:28,100
to tle into the building and you've got

312
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,389
to realize okay our plan was the teal

313
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,610
here into this building for a number of

314
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:33,619
these so we were going to be kind of

315
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,600
tailgating in tailgating to lunch

316
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,910
tailgating to the toilet every time you

317
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,319
wanna go over the toilet the thoughts

318
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,230
were maybe some people are going to

319
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:43,579
start noticing us maybe people are gonna

320
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,439
realize we're just tailgating all the

321
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:47,540
time so we get around that what's a good

322
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,649
way to get around that so I thought

323
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:53,209
standard cloning ID cards saw ID cards

324
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:55,249
the kind of standard card you get just

325
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:57,589
to put on a plate and that was a door

326
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:59,179
for you so we started to try to

327
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:01,590
understand what would be involved in

328
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:05,130
cloning an ID code

329
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:07,120
today that means this device a proximal

330
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,460
first thing we did was look on YouTube

331
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,880
and find lots of videos and all those

332
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:15,250
videos most of those videos where he can

333
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:19,510
press the little button you waive the ID

334
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:22,660
card at it and it's called Matic really

335
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:25,000
really really not that simple so over

336
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,719
the following weeks I gradually learned

337
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,310
more and more about cloning ID cards and

338
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,080
started to understand how there were so

339
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,969
many different kinds of ID cards some of

340
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,020
them had security vulnerabilities some

341
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,730
didn't have any known ones so really we

342
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,140
put a lot of work in and eventually got

343
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,110
to a point where we could clone some ID

344
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:46,000
cards and that kind of moment when you

345
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,560
eat evil a couple of weeks work into

346
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,710
something feeling like you just bang any

347
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,150
hit on a wall not understanding it -

348
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,740
getting there actually owning an ID card

349
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,390
was brilliant at that moment you put the

350
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,050
card on the door and the light turns

351
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:01,060
green and you can open the door freely

352
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,800
it said that on the job we took it on we

353
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:09,609
couldn't put on the ID cards but it was

354
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:12,969
interesting the next thing we did we we

355
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:15,940
made a hardware implant so this was a

356
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:18,010
device we could plug in the network to

357
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:21,040
get easy persistence on other networks

358
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,990
or took an idea 45 in power and

359
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,400
hopefully we'd be on the network and

360
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,010
have some sort of position box on the

361
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,459
network this was made out of a Raspberry

362
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,760
Pi

363
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:33,340
we had 4G connectivity on it and really

364
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,600
served as a command and control I quite

365
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,860
like this picture because you can see

366
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,780
the screws all sticking out so this is

367
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,490
the actual picture of the implant in

368
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,959
place and you can see the screws stick

369
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,400
and I hope that came in because you

370
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,070
thought that the the nature of how we

371
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,829
build the tools and and just the canid

372
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:52,000
it was just interesting that it lets put

373
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:54,910
together later that's what we used that

374
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,800
force or when we first put me in the

375
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,939
network the idea is it calls out to a

376
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,060
box that we've got on Azure

377
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:03,640
and we can essentially remote into the

378
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,229
implant fire review the first thing that

379
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,520
happened was SSH was blocked on the

380
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,210
network we were using so we couldn't get

381
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,730
through into it

382
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,620
luckily we could change that to use

383
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,600
HTTPS instead so we could still get into

384
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,850
it

385
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,680
we were we

386
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,310
using Microsoft teams for a lot of the

387
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,870
kind of messaging we do and we made it

388
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,489
so that this fox could talk to us by

389
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,810
Microsoft to use so that that

390
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,920
essentially the first time we connected

391
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:30,569
to the network its and it's a message

392
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,639
see I've connected he which was but also

393
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:34,709
other notifications so we we had it

394
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,420
giving us a heartbeat Spokane of every

395
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:37,829
couple of hours it would send us a

396
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,599
message to see I'm still alive I'm still

397
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:42,750
on network everything's all right

398
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,550
so that that was really useful and all

399
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,630
these things like file exfiltration that

400
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,620
sort of thing it was really useful for

401
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:52,709
that the last thing I'm looking at USB

402
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,180
rubber ducky so I think a lot of people

403
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:57,209
probably already know what a USB robot

404
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,519
IV is in case you don't it is a device

405
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:02,250
where you can essentially program it to

406
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,170
type things really quickly so you you

407
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,940
have it in your own computer you tell it

408
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,620
what it's gonna type and then you take

409
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,769
it to an unlock workstation you plug it

410
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,740
in it types those things really quickly

411
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:15,750
so you can use it for typing in scripts

412
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,550
to execute or you can get it to download

413
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,649
a script off the internet to execute or

414
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:23,310
you can just do silly things like change

415
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:24,779
people's backgrounds and things that so

416
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,540
it's a good tool but that for me wasn't

417
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:29,130
the best bit about this tool the best

418
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,969
bit was actually finding someone to use

419
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:35,819
it on so a lot of what we do is against

420
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:39,209
systems it's against the network it's

421
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:40,259
against website and API of building that

422
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:42,959
sort of things but this is actually

423
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,310
using it against a specific person so

424
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,899
maybe you've seen someone get up and go

425
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:48,540
to the toilet and leave the workstation

426
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:50,699
unlocked and you've kind of got a thing

427
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,410
is anybody looking I'm gonna go I'm

428
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,180
gonna put in ones if somebody comes back

429
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,449
what happens if their friend comes along

430
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,939
and says what are you doing so this was

431
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:03,630
really scary it was exciting

432
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:06,000
it felt was cheevus it was a roller

433
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,659
coaster emotional spot meeting by far

434
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,240
the most fun thing I've done so far and

435
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:14,199
I look for reason again

436
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,859
so finally would I want to be a

437
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:24,370
developer again in software developments

438
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:36,120
nowhere near as exciting as this is I

439
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:45,370
get the listening big questions

440
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:47,260
you mentioned about the light loss that

441
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,110
were complete beside us or watching

442
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,270
YouTube videos was that a ski that was a

443
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,280
lot of variety so some of it was kind of

444
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:58,450
reading and making notes some of it was

445
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,310
plural fight or cyber videos I didn't

446
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:03,340
actually include the kind of podcasts in

447
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:06,639
that so it was using the the kind of

448
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,750
speech prepetition tools so I I was just

449
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,070
in a waiting room for something I could

450
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:14,470
use that to go just on my fall and just

451
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:27,070
it does kind of flash cards yeah so yeah

452
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:28,930
a wide variety of things yeah yeah

453
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,149
that's a good question I don't think

454
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:36,340
that I dressed that well enough myself

455
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:38,700
in my own mind yeah I think it's

456
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:42,550
something along the lines of IT supports

457
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:44,110
you report an issue write anything but

458
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:51,300
yeah that needs more thought definitely

459
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:51,300
yes okay thank you very much

460
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,940
you
