1
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:14,750
so this is a secret message his contents

2
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:15,769
are known only by me it's in fact my

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,390
hotel key

4
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:20,930
but that diminishes my point this offers

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,820
away safely and securely now when you

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,920
have some secret information that you

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:28,939
wish communicated to only specific

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,189
parties be it a pen test report or your

9
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:33,860
Netflix credentials how would you ensure

10
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:36,500
only your intended target was able to

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,810
receive the message I hope for everyone

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,000
in the room the answer was either some

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:44,000
cryptographic solution or sod off I'm

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,769
not showing my Netflix as I'm sure many

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,870
of you are aware there is a looming

16
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,330
technology that is set to change the

17
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,669
landscape of cryptography quantum

18
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,739
computers they will force a change

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,750
that's already begun

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,490
although the NCSC for example predict

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,170
that quantum computers won't be

22
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,510
cryptographically relevant for another

23
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,400
10 years the drive to move to

24
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,670
cryptographic standards resistant to

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,710
this new threat has already begun in

26
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,230
this talk we'll provide an introduction

27
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:15,050
to this cutting edge field discuss

28
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,700
paradigms for security testing and types

29
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,370
of things to look for when offering

30
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,790
remediation advice quantum cryptography

31
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,980
and quantum resistant cryptography are

32
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:27,410
set to play increasing roles within our

33
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,720
industry and jobs in the next few years

34
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:33,110
so before we begin I suppose it's

35
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,658
prudent to introduce myself as you've

36
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,520
been told my name is Imran hello I have

37
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,200
an embassy in theoretical physics in

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,960
particular gravity particles and fields

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,940
and during my studies I participated in

40
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,399
online bug bounty programs

41
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,380
I found a p2 in a fortune 10 company and

42
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,260
largely because of this was part of the

43
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,810
group or did the bug prowl to 2017 VIP

44
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,550
researcher accolade that was the

45
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,500
transitionary point for myself from

46
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,149
wanting to do cybersecurity as a hobby

47
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,820
to something I've wanted to do full-time

48
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,890
as my job and I was fortunate enough to

49
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,658
be able to join Cyprus in January of

50
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,640
last year and I've been very happily

51
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,709
working as a security consultant in the

52
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,459
industry ever since

53
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:15,409
okay introductions are out the way so to

54
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,640
begin we'll talk about classical

55
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:17,840
information just a little bit of a

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,429
background before we get to quantum

57
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,700
information and this is because

58
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,739
Shannon's seminal 1948 paper discussing

59
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,659
classical information theory put forward

60
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:28,609
two important points that are relevant

61
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:31,099
to our talk today the first was the

62
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:33,709
concept of entropy which is a measure of

63
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:36,230
information or randomness or disorder

64
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:38,810
and the second is that it is possible to

65
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,060
communicate reliably over noisy channels

66
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,030
provided the rate of communication is

67
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,919
less than the channel capacity now with

68
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,510
quantum information we begin with the

69
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,700
idea that quantum systems are the

70
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,649
ultimate physical medium for storing and

71
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,149
processing information we're essentially

72
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,950
dealing with the building blocks of the

73
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,709
universe where as low level as we can

74
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,168
possibly get on a physical on a physical

75
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,829
level we can get performance

76
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:05,030
enhancements and performance increases

77
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:07,040
with architecture and with new

78
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,629
algorithms but the building blocks

79
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,429
themselves the materials were using are

80
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:13,340
the most efficient we can for the

81
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,780
storage and processing of information it

82
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,030
tries the quantum information theory

83
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,129
tries to extend Shannon's theory by

84
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,590
replacing bits of information which in

85
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:24,078
Erik 2d quantum systems called qubits

86
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,620
and classical channels by the noisy

87
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:29,030
quantum Channel counterparts in quantum

88
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,370
cryptography much like in classical

89
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,769
cryptography one would like to transmit

90
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,629
or share information securely except now

91
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,979
we're using the fact that quantum states

92
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:38,540
cannot be learned without being

93
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:41,479
disturbed for quantum key distribution

94
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:46,009
and other unique quantum phenomena for

95
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:47,840
other aspects of cryptography so again

96
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:49,548
we'll start classical computers to go

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,829
suburban introduction to quantum gates

98
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,599
as we know it classical computers

99
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:56,659
information is stored in bits ones and

100
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,939
zeros if storing one number take 64 bits

101
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:01,040
then storing n numbers will take 64

102
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,840
times n bits calculations are

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,448
essentially done the same way as they

104
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,609
are by hat as such the class of problems

105
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:10,250
that can be solved efficiently are the

106
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:12,919
same as that can be solved by hand where

107
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,109
efficiency refers to the idea that the

108
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,668
evaluation time doesn't increase too

109
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:18,668
quickly with the size of the input

110
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:26,250
with quantum computers information is

111
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,139
thirty cubits and a qubit like a

112
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,150
classical bit can be in a state of zero

113
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,949
and one however it could also be in a

114
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,130
superposition of these states say a 0

115
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:38,550
plus B 1 where a and B are complex

116
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,500
numbers we use complex numbers as they

117
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,259
provide benefits in the calculation and

118
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,539
comprehension of qubit States such as

119
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:52,050
the ability to map States to positions

120
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:54,780
on as firm as shown in the image whereas

121
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,110
a bit can exist as either 0 or 1 the two

122
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,000
points a qubit can exist in a continuum

123
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,949
of states and these are only confined by

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,099
the boundary of the sphere with poles at

125
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:06,840
0 & 1 calculations are performed by

126
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,789
mathematical operations called unitary

127
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,979
transformations these are them on the

128
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:12,810
states of the qubits and when combined

129
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,909
with the principle of superposition this

130
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,919
creates possibilities not available for

131
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:19,050
hand calculations this translates to

132
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,490
more efficient algorithms for factoring

133
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:25,020
searching and simulation of quantum

134
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:27,030
systems another benefit of super

135
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,430
positions is you get far more storage

136
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,710
capacity on a cuba in fact exponential

137
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,990
storage you could store say two numbers

138
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,109
on one qubit mapping each one to a stay

139
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,880
you'd be able to store tuneup cube for

140
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,880
numbers and two qubits so is that

141
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:49,349
manager started to come again to sleep

142
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:51,000
already so yeah so the two qubits you

143
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:54,360
have to store for numbers with three

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,979
cubits a there is actually an equation

145
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,659
on the board that then if it's big

146
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,669
enough to make out that you can be

147
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:01,469
arranging manipulate to tell you exactly

148
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:03,479
how many qubits you'd need to store n

149
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:04,919
numbers I'll leave it as a little puzzle

150
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,050
for the mathematically inclined and

151
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,280
anyone who's really interested can't

152
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,759
reach me run after and I'll tell you

153
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,710
exactly how much those so quantum

154
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,110
computers better at everything

155
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,479
well they utilize quantum mechanics to

156
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,000
solve problems much faster than it's

157
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,870
possible with a classical computer

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,659
quantum mechanics realizing the

159
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,219
principles of probability in quantum

160
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:28,320
mechanics we depend on numbers called

161
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,248
probability amplitudes which can be

162
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,369
positive

163
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:33,209
active or complex numbers a

164
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:35,279
simplification of the process is that

165
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:36,539
we're trying to orchestrate sir so some

166
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,429
of the wrong answers have positive

167
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:40,019
amplitudes others have negative

168
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:42,149
amplitudes and when the calculations

169
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:43,169
done they've destructively interfere and

170
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:45,149
cancel each other out

171
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,438
thus the wrong answer isn't observed we

172
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:48,209
also want the correct answers to

173
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,859
constructive interference let's hear

174
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:52,399
them this is a huge oversimplification

175
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:55,318
but is essentially how the process works

176
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,359
in general problems that utilize

177
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,039
parallelism the ability to split problem

178
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:00,839
into several parts and solve them all

179
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,579
simultaneously to arrive at a solution

180
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,169
are other problems that will benefit the

181
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:06,239
most from the games that quantum

182
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:08,219
computers have to offer problems like

183
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,419
prime number factorization the most

184
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:12,899
efficient route through a complicated

185
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:15,119
city grid both great candidates or is it

186
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,649
you're unlikely to see much of an FPS

187
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:23,610
increase in your favorite video games

188
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:25,169
apologies to any for my fans so where

189
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,109
are we currently with quantum computers

190
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:30,239
well the largest gate module processor

191
00:07:28,109 --> 00:07:34,019
was released in March of last year by

192
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:37,229
Google no surprise called Bristlecone it

193
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:39,629
weighs in at 72 qubits once there are

194
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:41,339
far larger quantum annealing processors

195
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,829
which are designed to solve very

196
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:46,319
specific sets of problems gate model

197
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:47,909
processes are what we normally think of

198
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,979
when we think of a con from computer and

199
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:52,019
are applicable to a far wider set of

200
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,959
problems they considered the universal

201
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:57,299
quantum computer but that was last year

202
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,639
and what's happening this year well in

203
00:07:57,299 --> 00:08:02,159
January IVM who've been very busy this

204
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,499
year introduced their first commercial

205
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:07,709
commercially available quantum system

206
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:10,739
the Q system one it weighs in about

207
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:13,139
twenty cubits and mr. Morimoto director

208
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:15,149
of IBM Research in Tokyo and global VP

209
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,860
said IBM intends to commercialize

210
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:19,229
quantum computers within three to five

211
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,479
years when he expects quantum computers

212
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:24,808
to be able to outperform supercomputers

213
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,610
in specific domains so it's virtual

214
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:29,969
first commercial computer can be seen as

215
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,199
a sort of statement of intent we also

216
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:33,719
had a research breakthrough this year

217
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,440
and succeeded in showing experimental

218
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,440
evidence for a new state of matter

219
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,379
topological superconductive 'ti as it is

220
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,810
very casually turned whilst the emotive

221
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:46,069
to this day was seen in a 2d system it

222
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,959
is believed that the system can be

223
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:50,509
scaled and expanded and used for the

224
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,219
construction of qubits this yields a

225
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:57,230
potential for increased calculation

226
00:08:52,220 --> 00:09:00,050
speeds and boosted storage finally with

227
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,699
cue experience iBM has effectively

228
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,359
brought quantum police found like a

229
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:07,189
sales pitch for IBM promised us it has

230
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,079
effectively brought the computers to

231
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:11,269
your home with the cloud quantum

232
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:13,489
computing binocular this allows for

233
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:15,170
experiments to be run on cue systems and

234
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,149
simulators that is quantum systems and

235
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,560
simulators and is available for the

236
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:21,740
public you can go sign up for the public

237
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,420
beta right now the cloud promises to

238
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,459
facilitate great strides in quantum

239
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:31,430
related fields by allowing more people

240
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:33,800
access to the technology cool sort of

241
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,388
cover an introduction on the quantum

242
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,790
computer side of things let's look at

243
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:39,889
the cryptography side and I appreciate

244
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,420
they're probably people in this room you

245
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:42,620
know far more about classical

246
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,719
cryptography than I do

247
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,149
so this might be teaching grandma how to

248
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,259
suck eggs but bear with me so we're all

249
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:49,610
in the same page with cryptography

250
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:51,560
before we move on to quantum

251
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,449
cryptography so what is the goal of

252
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,029
classical cryptography well we want to

253
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:58,040
allow secure communications over public

254
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,259
channels there are a bunch of ways to do

255
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,069
this one of them is the one time pad

256
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:07,069
algorithm where two parties a and B or

257
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:09,500
Alice and Bob use a one time free shared

258
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:11,479
key to encrypt information book and

259
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,430
issue with this approach is that of

260
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,380
secure key distribution which has

261
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,750
historically made it impractical for

262
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,850
most applications so have you get past

263
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,259
this secure key distribution issue well

264
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,420
we have things like the public private

265
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:25,059
key path which relies on the fact that

266
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,589
certain mathematical tools are

267
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:29,719
computationally hard for instance the

268
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:31,910
factorization of large numbers into

269
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,860
prime factors as used in the RSA

270
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:39,680
algorithm the RSA algorithm has proved

271
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,899
to be rather useful as current computers

272
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,939
can only factor numbers as large as 250

273
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,889
decimal digits I think so far the

274
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:46,959
biggest has been about 232 decimal

275
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:48,940
digits

276
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,620
as computers become more powerful larger

277
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,700
prime factors will need to be used in

278
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,500
order to preserve the security of the

279
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,960
algorithm but that isn't seen as a huge

280
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,250
issue that is until quantum computers

281
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,430
which threw a monkey wrench into the

282
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:02,830
whole operation in 1994 Peter shor

283
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,380
showed that a quantum computer to give

284
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:08,529
back to large numbers into their prime

285
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,360
factors in polynomial time now pull it

286
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:13,029
no real time algorithm is said to be

287
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,730
fast it's things like addition

288
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:18,970
subtraction square roots and logarithms

289
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,140
on a classical computer and as you can

290
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,540
imagine this will compromise the

291
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,880
security of the RSA algorithm and others

292
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,880
that use similar techniques if quantum

293
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,680
computer could calculate prime factors

294
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,550
as quick as a classical computer could

295
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,500
do logs so now that we know a little bit

296
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,479
about classical cryptography let's move

297
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,130
on to quantum cryptography now quantum

298
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,899
cryptography derives its trends from a

299
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,060
few weird properties of quantum

300
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,339
mechanics to begin with we have the

301
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,500
no-cloning theorem and this state that's

302
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:49,839
impossible to create an identical copy

303
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,959
of an arbitrary unknown and I must

304
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,880
stress unknown quantum state as such

305
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,099
intercept and replay attacks are

306
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,209
inherently protected against as we will

307
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,339
see later with quantum superposition we

308
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:05,529
have two or more quantum states which

309
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:07,990
can be summed to create another valid

310
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:10,300
quantum state that is every quantum

311
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:13,029
state can be thought of as a sum of two

312
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,859
or more distinct States as we've seen

313
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,600
already with quantum computers this

314
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,279
principle is critical to how they work

315
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,600
and contributes to many of the benefits

316
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:24,400
such systems offer finally and perhaps

317
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,980
the most famous of the quantum phenomena

318
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,589
listed is quantum entanglement which is

319
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,200
the interruption of quantum states

320
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:34,360
resulting in a quantum system that is no

321
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,459
longer independent so you have two

322
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,570
systems that interact and they can no

323
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:42,849
longer be described independently of one

324
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,260
another to describe one system or one

325
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,240
part of the system you have to describe

326
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,339
the other into effect one part you must

327
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,230
affect the other it has massive

328
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,510
implications for secure communications

329
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,070
and a teleportation of information with

330
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,100
active research taking place in the

331
00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:00,920
fields now I came across very recently a

332
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:03,720
great analogy for in time

333
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,219
like most of analogies totally breaks

334
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,930
down if you actually look at it so

335
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,760
please don't focus on it too much they

336
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,969
gives you the general idea of how it

337
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,610
works so imagine I had two balls in

338
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:17,880
front of me a red ball and a blue ball I

339
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,440
put them both in a box a separate box

340
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,640
one for the red ball one for the blue

341
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,790
ball and I hide them underneath this

342
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,380
desk I then pick someone who's

343
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,240
particularly quick in the audience you

344
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,100
can pretty quick Iguchi you can have

345
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,230
this box it has one of the balls in it

346
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,910
you don't know which one I then ask you

347
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,980
to run as fast as you can

348
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,300
out of here in fact we run so fast that

349
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,380
you're running on the speed of light and

350
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,670
just keep running out it's been alike

351
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,250
for like 30 years would all wait here

352
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,140
it's 5:00 leave the planet just keep

353
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,420
going in a straight line thirty years

354
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,860
later I'll take the other box up we

355
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,890
don't know what color balls in here and

356
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,200
so we can say it's either red or blue or

357
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:54,630
quantumly we can also say it can be in a

358
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,850
superposition of red and blue is it in

359
00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,000
fact exists over both states similar

360
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,680
sense then I reveal the port and the

361
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,290
ball to you I've opened the box and we

362
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,630
see we've got the red ball we instantly

363
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,280
know that 30 light-years away there's a

364
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,380
very exhausted young man in the third

365
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,300
row who has a blue ball

366
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,010
now we haven't violated any of the laws

367
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,689
of physics to do this but in describing

368
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,580
one part of the system

369
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,100
we've also described the other part of

370
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,620
the system the two were were linked on

371
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,860
some fundamental level and by forcing

372
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,590
our ball to be red we've also caused his

373
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,330
ball to be blue and so in a nutshell and

374
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:35,790
if you don't look too closely that's it

375
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:39,540
son so the pros and cons of quantum

376
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:41,730
cryptography well a pro is that cannot

377
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,040
be unknowingly intercepted we'll see

378
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,780
this in more detail later but due to the

379
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,449
properties of the no-cloning theorem and

380
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,949
quantum entanglement it is impossible

381
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,410
for information to be unknowingly

382
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,880
intercepted it's also secured a

383
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,530
respective computing power

384
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,570
the security comes from the underlying

385
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,579
physical properties of these devices

386
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,440
it's baked into the universe and it

387
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:06,000
can't just be cracked with more

388
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,290
computing power finally it's secured at

389
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,600
the physical level if we're thinking of

390
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,589
the OSI model it's secure the lowest

391
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,080
layer

392
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:15,780
and as such can secure the complete

393
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:21,780
end-to-end encryption without any need

394
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:25,199
for SSL or VPN as good as it sounds

395
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,420
there are some cons it is ridiculously

396
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,590
expensive at the moment and this is due

397
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,599
to it being the cutting edge of

398
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,820
cryptography research and development

399
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,360
costs are high as are the fabrication

400
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:38,520
costs of specialist components needed to

401
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,310
support fragile quantum states and this

402
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,199
all effects the final sale price the

403
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,060
core requirement for exacting conditions

404
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,430
that means that if you Matt dictates the

405
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,439
need for special infrastructure capable

406
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,709
of supporting quantum cryptography which

407
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,150
also has its own associated costs

408
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,340
finally there are practical problems in

409
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:58,380
the implementation this is a very new

410
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,940
technology and there are still these

411
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,340
practical problems to overcome for

412
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,440
example fiber based quantum key

413
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,270
distribution can only travel so far

414
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,380
although as we'll touch on later there

415
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:12,750
have been some breakthroughs in this

416
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:15,689
area so where are we contemplate or

417
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,370
affirm right now 2019 well we have two

418
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,670
random number generators which are

419
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,710
essential for the secure imported secure

420
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,740
encryption keys and fully an enhancement

421
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,450
of entropy and as we described earlier

422
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:30,060
entropy entropy can be said to be a

423
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:32,250
measure of this order randomness or

424
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,020
uncertainty in a system and to the

425
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,570
introduction of truly random number

426
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,240
generators or of obvious benefit and in

427
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,850
fact Shannon who was to be a person who

428
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,140
made that seminal 1940 paper conveying

429
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,820
the concept of entropy had a great

430
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,699
anecdote about coming up with the term

431
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,600
injury he said my greatest concern was

432
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,940
what to call it

433
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,250
I thought calling it information but

434
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,500
that way was overly used so I decided to

435
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,390
call it uncertainty when I discussed

436
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,140
this with John von Neumann he had a

437
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,780
better idea

438
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:03,930
for Newman told me you should call her

439
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:06,569
entropy for two reasons in the first

440
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,730
place your uncertainty function has been

441
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:11,339
used in statistical mechanics under that

442
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:14,040
name already so it hasn't it and in the

443
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,790
second place and more importantly no one

444
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,440
really knows what entropy really is and

445
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:23,869
in a debate you'll always have the

446
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:26,270
advantage we also have right now quantum

447
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:28,969
key distribution devices and these allow

448
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,920
for the secure key a key exchange for

449
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,990
encryption of multitude of devices

450
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,160
animosity of applications and they're

451
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,780
being sought by a bunch of different

452
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,450
companies in wanting use multitude three

453

455
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,439
quintessence labs to protect are some

456
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,360
examples sales so far generally led by

457
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,100
the financial market and following that

458
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,649
we have government and defense in fact

459
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,719
last year the financial segment had a

460
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,400
market share of around 38% so that's a

461
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,780
pretty huge and this was followed quite

462
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,030
closely behind by government and defense

463
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,310
which accounted for about 31 percent and

464
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,899
27 percent of the market respectively so

465
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,760
that that's almost the whole market

466
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,430
plans for new quantum key distribution

467
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,610
networks exist in the US with the TEL

468
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,760
Japan with NI CT and China with quantum

469
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:19,070
Sita so we are seeing big governments

470
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,990
across the world started to adopt this

471
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,480
technology and in fact their as their

472
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:26,930
mark is estimated to grow to four point

473
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:31,940
eight billion by 2023 coming from 1.7

474
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:33,620
billion last year cool so we touched on

475
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,440
that but what exactly is quantum key

476
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:39,139
distribution it is certainly the best

477
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,300
known and most well developed branch of

478
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,430
quantum cryptography it has the goal of

479
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,649
provide an information theoretically

480
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:48,890
secure solution to the problems of key

481
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:50,360
exchange utilizing qkd protocols I'm

482
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,940
going to say quantum key distribution a

483
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,149
lots are abbreviated to qkd for the sake

484
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,550
of my voice in your res utilizing qkt

485
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,830
protocols to parties should be able to

486
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,740
establish a key that can be used for

487
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,780
secure communications without that key

488
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,570
being unknowingly intercepted by a third

489
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,129
party this should remain the case even

490
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,290
if all communications were done over

491
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:14,660
public channels they still should not be

492
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:18,020
able to be an unknown eavesdropper who

493
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,330
is able to enumerate the key whilst

494
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,730
unconditional security has been proven

495
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,620
mathematically that is to say there are

496
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,540
no constraints placed on the abilities

497
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,979
of the each dropper and this is not

498
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,379
something possible with classical key

499
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,110
distribution there are some assumptions

500
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,340
that need to be made one being that the

501
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,590
universe hasn't had a change of heart

502
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,929
and the laws of quantum mechanics still

503
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,330
hold to be true and the other being that

504
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,070
to genuine parties so Allison Bob our a

505
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,379
and B can successfully authenticated

506
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,060
others so you can't impersonate neither

507
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,250
and thus conducts man-in-the-middle

508
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,990
attacks

509
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,300
whilst it's seemingly secure there are

510
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,550
still issues in its implementation with

511
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,190
key generation rate being a particular

512
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,659
issue we can't generate keys as quick as

513
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,280
we can with classical systems not at the

514
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,900
moment at least and transmission today

515
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,370
that distance is still being in issue

516
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,980
when I first talked about transmission

517
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,270
distance I had someone tell me what do

518
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,070
you mean it can't go further than a few

519
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,660
nanometers that's not exactly what I

520
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,760
mean it can definitely go further than a

521
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,400
few nanometers and in fact you've had

522
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,410
some breakthroughs in this area in 2018

523
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,450
last year new query me at I'll put

524
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,700
forward away to possibly overcome the

525
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,230
resistance limit entirely or at least

526
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,530
make massive strides in it and that is

527
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:29,660
the proposed twin field qkd scheme this

528
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:32,930
suggests that the optical kirei could be

529
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,880
achieved on 550 kilometers of standard

530
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,680
optical fibre already used in

531
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,780
communications today are the same person

532
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,060
then turned around asked me does that

533
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,399
mean we can use it in current systems

534
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:45,320
which is a perfectly valid question and

535
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,850
no we still have things like switches

536
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,520
and stuff like that and that would get

537
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,870
in the way and could destroy Danica

538
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,910
quantum states but it means that

539
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,949
materials we use today materials that

540
00:20:52,910 --> 00:21:00,560
aren't particularly expensive can be

541
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:02,240
employed in creating qkt systems so what

542
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,889
besides QD is there when it comes to

543
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,570
quantum cryptography it's not the

544
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:09,650
end-all and Beall so there's been a lot

545
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,409
of work in the field of quantum

546
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,910
cryptography that has focused on qkz but

547
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,370
it's not being the only branch where

548
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,770
this has taken place other areas that

549
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,149
address issues with qkd such as the

550
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,490
inefficiency of qkd

551
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,800
for large networks utilizing symmetric

552
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,960
it's Hana crypto systems due to the key

553
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,820
management overheads or other is related

554
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,260
to other cryptography entirely different

555
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,480
tasks and functions are all being

556
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,550
actively researched we have things like

557
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,080
quantum fingerprinting quantum digital

558
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,629
signatures and entity authentication

559
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,509
that have all had good strides made in

560
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,399
their respective fields

561
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:45,379
haven't spoken about qkd let's have a

562
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:47,570
look at one of the most popular quantum

563
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:49,370
key distribution protocols and the basis

564
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:54,500
for many commercial devices that are

565
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:56,268
available today so what is the goal well

566
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,190
the goal is to establish a key between

567
00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:00,710
Alice and Bob such as an eavesdropper

568
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:04,070
will call they Eve can't listen and

569
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:05,509
learn just by listening and once this

570
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,039
kid's been established it can then be

571
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:08,779
used to communicate the caller securely

572
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,750
using something like the one time pile

573
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:13,639
algorithm the basic idea is the elephant

574
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,679
ball but use quantum systems to

575
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:17,539
establish the key and if Eve tries to

576
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,190
learn the state of the system surely

577
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:21,049
never to be disturbed that state and

578
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,840
this can be detected by both Alice and

579
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:26,090
Bob Eve can sabotage the protocol sure

580
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,549
in which case Alice and Bob won't be

581
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,230
able to establish the key however the

582
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:32,240
goal is to make sure that if Alice and

583
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,700
Bob agree that the protocol is

584
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:42,230
successful the chance that Eve knows the

585
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:44,149
key is very very small oh yeah also BB

586
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,190
84 is a key distribution system proposed

587
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:50,149
by Bennett and Prasad in 1984 and

588
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:54,590
nothing to do with stalls have had that

589
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:56,539
comment before so what are the steps now

590
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:59,178
this prepares the qubit randomly in one

591
00:22:56,539 --> 00:23:01,190
of four states and sends it to Bob Bob

592
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:03,620
measures the received Cuba in one of two

593
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,929
bases randomly with a probability of

594
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,928
half or 50/50 for each one of those two

595
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:10,970
places a listen Bob did reveal the basis

596
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:13,129
in which the qubit was both prepared by

597
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:15,320
Alice and measured by Bob they do this

598
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:18,049
for a classical channel but they do not

599
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,720
say the state or respective outcome of

600
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:22,879
their measurements and encoding if the

601
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,240
basis coincide they add a bit to their

602
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:28,879
list otherwise they disregard that qubit

603
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,649
entirely in order to make sure he hasn't

604
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:33,678
tampered they broke a proportion of

605
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:35,418
their key bits say half and compare them

606
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,820
using a classical channel they should

607
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:39,440
see no significant differences if they

608
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,210
see differences that are much higher

609
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,379
than the error array of the channel they

610
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,379
no use be meddling

611
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,710
so is it secure there are several

612
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,470
mathematical proofs attesting to the

613
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,210
security of this protocol one such proof

614
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,900
is provided in the further reading slide

615
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:02,180
for anyone interested however the maths

616
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,370
can be a little hairy and the more so as

617
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,960
we go from less simple proofs so today

618
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,570
we'll just focus on the intuition behind

619
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,610
the proof the central principle is that

620
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,500
in order for you to learn the key the

621
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:16,879
qubits that are sent by Alice must be

622
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:18,830
intercepted and measured if Eve knows

623
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,230
the basis to which the qubits were

624
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,659
prepared happy days she can measure it

625
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:25,490
in the correct basis learn the state

626
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,370
without altering it and pass it on to

627
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:29,990
Bob it she's not cheating it's not an

628
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,969
unknown quantum state she knows the

629
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,980
state he was prepared to she can measure

630
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,600
her play with it will not play with it

631
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,510
because then it would change but measure

632
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,850
and then pass it on undisturbed however

633
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:43,370
the problem is M doesn't know which stay

634
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:47,120
Alice used and so this leaves her with

635
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,500
two possible alternatives Yves can

636
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,330
choose one of the two bases randomly

637
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,130
she's got a 50/50 shot measuring that

638
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,919
basis and impasse the system went to Bob

639
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,930
if if choose if Eve chooses the same

640
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,610
basis as that of Alice's prepared today

641
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,980
then she obtains the result she's

642
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,990
looking for happy days again and can

643
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,150
pass on the states above totally

644
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,190
undisturbed bubble never know on the

645
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:09,890
other hand if Eve measures in the other

646
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,200
basis then a state sent to Bob will have

647
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:14,240
alters completely and when Bob makes his

648
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,010
own measurements there is a one in four

649
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,170
chance that he'll obtain Alice's

650
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:20,450
prepared state those aren't great odds

651
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:22,460
so what else can she do well you can

652
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,750
keep the system sent by Alice and

653
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,360
measure up only off to classical

654
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:29,390
communications taking place once she

655
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,889
knows and it says I pay in this state

656
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,660
Bob says I've mentioned it in this stage

657
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,210
he's like cool I'll measure in a state I

658
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,460
was prepared in she can decode the whole

659
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:42,140
key but she has to send something to Bob

660
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:43,820
and since she's keeping Alice's qubit

661
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,530
and stare and then unknown state so she

662
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:56,290
can't float them no-cloning theorem

663
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:56,290
prohibits that hello okay cool

664
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:02,750
so yeah so she has said some things

665
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:04,100
about she can send to either Alice

666
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,570
Nathan long and which case she won't

667
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,050
have it because there is no cloning

668
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:10,669
theorem or she can make up some data and

669
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,159
send it to Bob so that's what she does

670
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:15,530
she makes up a bunch of bogus data and

671
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,670
sends her on to Bob now there's a

672
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,440
significant chance that Bob's

673
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,000
measurements will give a different

674
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,070
result to those that would have been

675
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,080
made if he had got Alice's original

676
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:26,689
signal because there's a very low

677
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,600
likelihood that Bob that Yves made up

678
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:33,680
data somehow perfectly resembles Alice's

679
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,120
original data so using the first option

680
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,280
there's a small likelihood of successful

681
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,530
eavesdropping which further diminishes

682
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,210
as we use a greater number of qubits and

683
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,950
with a second option there's no real

684
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,440
charm is due to the no-cloning theorem

685
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,270
meaning Eve is essentially making up

686
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:54,440
data and hoping it magically matches

687
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:56,480
with Alice's so in general Eve may

688
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,180
employ more sophisticated attacks in

689
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,780
which several successive qubits are

690
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,940
measured

691
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,340
this makes the proof of security more

692
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,630
hairy and the maths more ugly but at the

693
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,149
heart of the proof is the fact that

694
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:10,420
quantum information cannot be copied as

695
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,560
dictated by the no-cloning theorem

696
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,660
quantum cryptography is fast approaching

697
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,030
the stage of technological applications

698
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,490
with several companies in the process of

699
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:21,730
producing cryptographic systems based on

700
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,470
this new b84 protocol as we've mentioned

701
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:26,450
commercial qkd sisters and systems that

702
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,250
already exist include the ID Quantico

703
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,890
service tree system we talked about and

704
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:33,260
can be bought for the low low price of

705
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:34,670
$82,000 now that was when I first

706
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,950
checked this out and that price may have

707
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:40,420
dropped by since then it could be as low

708
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,420
as $50,000 now who knows

709
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,950
generally in commercial systems the four

710
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,990
states the qubits are implemented as

711
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,510
full polarizations of a single photon

712
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:55,580
state companies manufacturing such

713
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:58,280
systems include Toshiba I drew Quantico

714
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:02,389
secure net quintessence labs and magic

715
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:04,340
technologies great so we know about the

716
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,370
BBA fee for protocol let's get to the

717
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,290
fun stuff let's break it so when you

718
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,659
take away from this talk is a paradigm

719
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:14,230
on how to approach pen testing quantum

720
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:16,040
systems it's not as scary as it sounds

721
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,380
vulnerabilities can be broken down into

722
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,110
two broad classes we have inherent flaws

723
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,360
and implementation flaws inherent flaws

724
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:25,669
exists when assumption made during the

725
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,100
creation of a protocol doesn't hold to

726
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:30,500
be true a new mathematical technique or

727
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,409
approach for instance may break the

728
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,390
security of that protocol an example of

729
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,570
a protocol with inherent flaws would be

730
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:40,360
SSL version through implementation flaws

731
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:42,649
on the other hand exists because

732
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:46,250
real-world physical systems aren't

733
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:49,970
perfect nor is Arthur that's a hard word

734
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:51,290
to say our adaptation of the doesn't

735
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,080
sound like as hardware to say it is when

736
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:56,300
years that stood up here our adaptation

737
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,520
of their ethical principles to physical

738
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,590
mediums such informations can be

739
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:04,460
exploited to compromise and otherwise

740
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:06,560
secure protocol as we're about to see so

741
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,480
to begin with let's remove a bit of

742
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,580
abstraction from the BBA t4 protocol and

743
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,560
think about Alice and Bob setup Alice

744
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,990
needs a process for encoding her qubits

745
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,870
some sort of photon generator a laser

746
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:19,610
and Bob needs an observation machine to

747
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,489
carry out measurements some sort of

748
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:24,229
photon detector you can exploit Hardware

749
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:28,460
weaknesses in these components to

750
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:31,370
compromise the BP 84 protocol we start

751
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:34,880
with one that is called the indirect

752
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:36,350
copying attack and this actually plays

753
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,560
with it one of the assumptions we made

754
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:42,110
earlier which is that Allison Bob needs

755
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,850
to be able to successfully authenticate

756
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,550
each other

757
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:49,219
so in this Eve constructs a list of all

758
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,240
of Alice's possible States she can use

759
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,670
to encode her qubits

760
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,740
even it intercepts Alice's qubits as

761
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:57,010
they're transmitted to Bob she measures

762
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,960
them and find each qubits value

763
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:00,279
having found this information she's

764
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,080
messed around with those qubits they're

765
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,620
no longer in the original state she gets

766
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,678
rid of them

767
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,719
she then sends qubits to Bob matching

768
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,279
Alice's original signal that she creates

769
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,630
herself now that might sound like

770
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,309
cheating but it isn't these are no

771
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,620
longer unknown quantum states and

772
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:16,809
through her measurements she's created

773
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,908
qubits and through clever mathematical

774
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:20,830
operations she can reverse engineer with

775
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:21,730
a high probability of success Alice's

776
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,830
original signal

777
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,110
so once he reproduces Alice's original

778
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:28,750
signal she sends it on to Bob Bob's

779
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:31,090
never the wiser it's important to know

780
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,460
that this attack only works on protocols

781
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,250
like BB 84 where the quantum state is

782
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,049
encoded in transit alongside this Eve

783
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,000
must know all of the possible states

784
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,799
Alice can use to include her qubits and

785
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,720
try to keep her time interval between

786
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:47,350
successive qubits as close as possible

787
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,450
to Alice's original signal alongside

788
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,668
keeping the delay between Alice sending

789
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:55,809
and Bob receiving as small as possible

790
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:57,789
so that her presence isn't further cool

791
00:30:55,809 --> 00:31:00,580
that's not an easy ask so let's look at

792
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:02,230
another attack this one is called the

793
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:06,070
photon number splitting attack and this

794
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:13,110
does deal with component weaknesses in

795
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:15,730
physical systems so practically with

796
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:17,350
with most Kinkaid II devices I don't

797
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,539
know if it's true or qkd with devices

798
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:21,370
but for most single photon sources

799
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:24,158
aren't used and that's because they're

800
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:27,129
incredibly difficult to manufacture as

801
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,220
such we coherent pulses are used in most

802
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:32,200
actual cryptographic devices a weak

803
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,260
coherent pulse is a photon pulse that

804
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,240
has a low mean photon number and that is

805
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,669
to say a low number of photons in that

806
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,769
pulse on average I do think almost like

807
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:43,299
they think all we use we pair of pulses

808
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:46,090
are just scared to stick my neck out and

809
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:48,580
savor it can be achieved by passing

810
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:51,100
short low powered laser pulses through a

811
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,110
Nintendo enters the pns attack takes

812
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,000
advantage of a limitation present in we

813
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:57,070
coherent pulse generators and that's

814
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,399
that salt sometimes multiple photon

815
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:02,168
pulses are emitted so what happens when

816
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,908
a multiple photon pulse is emitted well

817
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:06,549
you can intercept a portion of those

818
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:08,830
photons and send the rest on to Bob Eve

819
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,730
waits for elephant Bob to announce their

820
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,889
respective transfer

821
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,409
and detection basis via their classical

822
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:16,600
channel and then she measures her

823
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:20,710
captured photons just like Bob would and

824
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:23,199
bill Turkey alongside them both The

825
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,480
Pianist attack was powerful is complex

826
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,279
to implement and this is because the

827
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,139
probability that a multiple photon pulse

828
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,600
is emitted for a good week coherent

829
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:33,908
pulse generator is only around 5% as

830
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,860
such Eve has to check whether the

831
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:38,080
emitted pulse contains multiple photons

832
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:40,658
or not and this demands both proper

833
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,908
hardware and algorithms given that this

834
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:46,929
is all in place however it be very hard

835
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:48,820
for Bob mrs. Hecht ease presence finally

836
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:50,860
we come to my favor of the attacks and

837
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,990
it is called a light injection attack

838
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,939
arguably the most science fictiony

839
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,580
sounding of the three but photon numbers

840
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,649
playing let's give it one for this money

841
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,750
you can execute this attack against

842
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:02,918
Alice or Bob so let's say the case about

843
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,679
it begin with and then we'll work our

844
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,570
way back to attacking Bob Eve sends a

845
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,730
light pulse at one of the devices in

846
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,620
this case Alice's photon generator and

847
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:14,049
registers the reflected pulse that comes

848
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,969
back because of the design of qkd

849
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:18,279
Hardware the reflected pulse will

850
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:20,679
indicate which process or photon

851
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,529
generator will be used by analysts to

852
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:26,019
generate the next Cuba Eve knows which

853
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:28,000
process Alice is about to use to encode

854
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:29,919
her qubits and thus you can perform an

855
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,049
intercept and replay attack with a

856
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,090
hundred percent certainty that she'll be

857
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:36,970
using the correct observer for each

858
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:39,549
incoming Cuba you can capture the entire

859
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:41,769
key as Alice sensor and sim qubits to

860
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:43,929
Bob without Alice or Bob being able to

861
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,429
detect the presence using the

862
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:47,169
information again communicated over the

863
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:49,210
classical channel he will be able to

864
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:51,190
create the same key as Alice and Bob

865
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:53,200
Snively the attacking Bob is a very

866
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:56,169
similar process she sends a light pulse

867
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,269
at Bob's device enumerates in the

868
00:33:56,169 --> 00:34:00,669
reflected pulse which detection basis

869
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:02,980
he's going to be using she matches the

870
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:05,289
same detection basis so when Bob's right

871
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,419
she's white the qubits unchanged gets

872
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:08,050
passed on to Bob happy days when she's

873
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:09,970
wrong

874
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,990
Bob's wrong as well which means it

875
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:12,879
doesn't matter that she was wrong

876
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:14,560
because Alice is just gonna tell Bob get

877
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,509
rid of that Cuba any way you measured it

878
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,339
wrong so in either case she gets the

879
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,740
bullet up the key alongside Bob and

880
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:23,250
neither Alice or Bob have any clue that

881
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:27,250
she was there

882
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:28,840
so those are all problematic what can we

883
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,840
do about them how could we offer clients

884
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,400
remediation advice

885
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,110
well remediation advice comes in two

886
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,810
flavors or a combination of both of them

887
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:40,720
I wanted to give the Neapolitan joke but

888
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:42,639
it's only two flavors passive measures

889
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,169
include inherent properties of the

890
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,179
infrastructure that make them resistant

891
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:48,760
to such attacks an example of a passive

892
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:51,069
measure for Alice would be an attenuator

893
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,930
at the output of a setup Eve requires

894
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,580
more powerful lasers to get through the

895
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:56,649
attenuator well then we add in an

896
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,810
optical isolator and a bandpass filter

897
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:01,630
the optical isolate all allowed qubits

898
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:03,070
through Alice's light through and with

899
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,020
no problem but in the opposite direction

900
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,670
Eve trying to come in and makes the

901
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,170
power requirements incredibly high it

902
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,220
makes them untenable with the inclusion

903
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:12,790
of the bandpass filter and the

904
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,290
attenuator to do this though there's a

905
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,730
small note we do need to change from

906
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,040
single photon States that we were using

907
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:20,020
theoretically to the wheat per home

908
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,800
pulses that don't make much of

909
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,300
difference because they're actually

910
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,370
what's generally used in qadian devices

911
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,720
we also have active measures and an

912
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,060
active measure is the introduction of

913
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,640
tools designed to mitigate specific

914
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:36,520
attacks so we could say have a detector

915
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,100
to warn Alice and Bob average and

916
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,200
all peak power of an incoming pulse rise

917
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:43,390
above a certain level if they if that

918
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,310
happens they know he was trying to send

919
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,569
a light pulse powerful enough that the

920
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,700
reflected pulse contains information

921
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:51,420
about their encoding and detection bases

922
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,830
this 11 to the fact someone is trying to

923
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,830
numerate their key they can either then

924
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:58,210
scrap the protocol and start again or

925
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:00,040
they can can try and convince themselves

926
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:05,490
whatever they were trying to say really

927
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:07,750
isn't that important and just lever so

928
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:10,240
we've talked about quantum cryptography

929
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:12,430
and now we'll talk about what's

930
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,290
considered quantum resistant or post

931
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,930
quantum cryptography I don't like the

932
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:18,790
term post quantum cryptography because

933
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:20,319
it implies we've already got quantum and

934
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,580
now we're moving on to post constant

935
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,050
when we have you even got quantum yet

936
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:26,160
it's a problem most people worry about

937
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:29,200
yesterday post quantum cryptography

938
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,379
leverages cryptographic algorithms which

939
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,850
can be run on classical or modern like

940
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,370
computers we have in front of us and

941
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,900
these algorithms

942
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:39,779
thought to be secure against quantum

943
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,670
computer attacks as we've stated the

944
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,040
problem with most algorithms that we use

945
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:46,110
today is that their security is based

946
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,570
upon a class of mathematically difficult

947
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,660
problems all of which can be solved in a

948
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,490
sufficiently powerful quantum computer

949
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,529
even though current publicly known

950
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,450
quantum computers lack the processing

951
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:59,700
power to be cryptographically relevant

952
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:02,490
many cryptographers are designing new

953
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:05,060
algorithms for when quantum computers

954
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:07,649
become powerful enough to be a threat

955
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:10,279
there are currently four main flavors of

956
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:17,390
public key post quantum crypto systems

957
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:20,640
the first because this is a mouthful is

958
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,750
lattice based crypto systems I was not a

959
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,790
lecture book that'd be hard to get

960
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,490
through this is the most well understood

961
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:29,430
and widely studies family of hard math

962
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:31,500
problems if that's being researched for

963
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:33,600
post quantum cryptography it is perhaps

964
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,090
the most popular flavor due to the

965
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,440
historic mathematical interest and the

966
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,570
versatility of the crypto schemes

967
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,390
possible allowing for the replacement of

968
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:44,250
essentially all endangered protocols but

969
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,470
also the introduction of entirely new

970
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,150
classes and cryptographic tools that are

971
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,040
not currently available when using

972
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:52,320
factoring or other hard mathematical

973
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,660
problems the second is code base crypto

974
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,250
systems it's another popular flavor that

975
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,560
includes crypto systems which rely on

976
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:03,630
error correcting codes such as the

977
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,370
mikelis algorithm the original

978
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,920
McCullough signature used random dropper

979
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:10,410
codes which has withstood scrutiny for

980
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,780
over 30 years however many variants

981
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:15,509
which aim to structure the code more so

982
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,300
as to reduce key sizes have been shown

983
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,890
to be insecure unfortunately so we've

984
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,050
also got hash trees public key

985
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,640
cryptosystems and hash based digital

986
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,070
signatures were invented in the late

987
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,390
seventies they fill out a vogue as there

988
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,460
is a limit to the number of signatures

989
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:31,770
that can be signed using a corresponding

990
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,900
set of private keys post ponton

991
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:36,120
cryptography has revitalized interest in

992
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,160
this field however and finally we have

993
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,049
multivariate crypto systems this

994
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,060
includes encryption schemes based on the

995
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:44,610
difficulty of solving systems of

996
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,049
multivariate equations whilst attempts

997
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,920
to build secure multivariate

998
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,650
multivariate equation encryption

999
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,300
circles have failed such schemes could

1000
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:54,790
provide a basis for the construction of

1001
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,280
a quantum secure signature at some point

1002
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,680
I also wanted to quickly touch upon

1003
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,960
symmetric encryption as given that

1004
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,330
suitably large keys are used systems

1005
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,430
like AES are already in quantum resistor

1006
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:08,380
in addition to this key management

1007
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:11,049
protocols which employs symmetric keys

1008
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,200
like her Burris are inherently secure

1009
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:15,790
against attack by a quantum computer

1010
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,560
some researchers suggest expanding the

1011
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:19,720
use of purpose like key management

1012
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,670
system as a way to get post quantum

1013
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,770
cryptography today and with Kerberos

1014
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:30,340
roasting either pentester can only

1015
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:32,890
encourage this kind of thinking so post

1016
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:36,070
quantum cryptography what other person

1017
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:38,080
hunts as well an obvious pros the costs

1018
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:40,570
due to the decreased research and

1019
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,340
development expenses relative to quantum

1020
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:45,070
cryptography in addition to it being

1021
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:54,040
less resource-intensive the cost of post

1022
00:39:45,070 --> 00:40:13,450
quantum cryptography is significantly

1023
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:18,310
less oh can you hear me is this what

1024
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:20,319
yeah ok cool so as I was saying it's a

1025
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,610
lot cheaper due to the decreased

1026
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,980
research and development expenses

1027
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,910
relatives of quantum cryptography in

1028
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,220
addition to it being less

1029
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,779
resource-intensive the cost of post

1030
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,930
partum photography is significantly

1031
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,220
lower then it's quantum counterplot it

1032
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:36,669
also works on current infrastructure

1033
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:39,129
which is great it works this way and it

1034
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,780
feeds into the lower costs as expensive

1035
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:43,540
and specialized equipment is not

1036
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,700
required in order to facilitate post

1037
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,170
quantum photography this form of

1038
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,149
cryptography should be capable of

1039
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:51,460
running on current classical computers

1040
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:54,420
and as such may have a larger scope of

1041
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,420
possible applications

1042
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,220
during no small part to the prior two

1043
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,770
reasons this field is massively popular

1044
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:06,290
with tons of active research taking

1045
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:11,230
place and many supporters including the

1046
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:13,850
NCSC however it does have several issues

1047
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:16,040
due to this being such a young fields it

1048
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:18,020
essentially bought as a response to the

1049
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,610
increasing threat quantum computers

1050
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,460
continue to bless on current

1051
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:24,800
cryptography there may be many flaws and

1052
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:27,260
inherent weaknesses that are yet to be

1053
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,650
uncovered simply due to the fields

1054
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:32,780
immaturity any such issue when

1055
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,910
discovered would immediately threaten

1056
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:38,380
the confidentiality of data secured

1057
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:40,520
using the relevant encryption a

1058
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,530
particular challenge of post quantum

1059
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,290
photography is the implementation of

1060
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:48,290
quantum safe algorithms into existing

1061
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:50,990
systems I'm sure many of us have come

1062
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:53,600
across clients who are forced to run

1063
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,520
outdated and vulnerable cryptography key

1064
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,160
to legacy systems which don't support

1065
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,450
modern TLS implementations this issue

1066
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,980
will only be made worse by the

1067
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,560
introduction of post quantum

1068
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:06,680
cryptography unless these implementation

1069
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:09,320
issues are overcome finally we have key

1070
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,299
size they're often trade-offs related to

1071
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,750
key size computational efficiency and

1072
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:17,150
cipher text or signature size as kept as

1073
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,530
such care must be taken when choosing

1074
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:21,560
which post quantum cryptography

1075
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:23,870
algorithms to employ Wayne for example

1076
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:29,480
the effort required to send large public

1077
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:31,160
keys over the internet so this is all

1078
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,170
interesting but why are we talking about

1079
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:36,170
it now what's the point of having this

1080
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:38,210
conversation today well no one is sure

1081
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:40,340
when cryptographically relevant quantum

1082
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:41,750
computers will be available depending on

1083
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,210
how who you ask

1084
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:46,790
even estimates range from a few years to

1085
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:48,590
never but the general consensus is that

1086
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:51,620
we should plan for around a decade as

1087
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:53,930
such a worst case scenario can be put

1088
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,089
forward of the complete failure of a

1089
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:59,509
massive portion of cryptographic sisters

1090
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:01,700
within 10 years we should put in place a

1091
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:03,530
strategy early enough that will allow

1092
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,169
for quantum resilience in terms of

1093
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:07,840
protect sensitive data for the full term

1094
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:10,000
of its security life

1095
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,160
the strategies we put in place need

1096
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,470
testing and assurance so that in an

1097
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,230
attempt to adjust vulnerabilities we

1098
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:18,759
don't end up introducing more for some

1099
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:21,760
day taking the argue day it's already

1100
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,680
too late with harvesting attacks we

1101
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,510
could already have people intercepting

1102
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,149
malicious actors intercepting data today

1103
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:32,980
for decryption when quantum computers

1104
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:34,750
ensure your honor so you want to be in

1105
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,060
the front-runners you want to be

1106
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:39,430
offering that assurance and testing for

1107
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:41,259
new quantum systems and you decide that

1108
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:43,899
this all sounds great and you want to

1109
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,520
build your own ensemble app how do you

1110
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,250
go about this it might not be as scary

1111
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,990
as it seems there are two ways you can

1112
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,730
build a physical system to test

1113
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:55,569
particular protocols and implementations

1114
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:57,040
all use virtualization with a physical

1115
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:58,870
apparatus you'd be forgiven for thinking

1116
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,720
building one would require exorbitant

1117
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:04,060
sums of money essentially all you need

1118
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:07,230
to say model the bp80 floor protocol

1119
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:09,580
would be a source some kind of laser a

1120
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:12,160
photon detector some polarization

1121
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:14,049
filters and beams oh and then some

1122
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,670
electronics as well to control all the

1123
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:20,680
components and register output there are

1124
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:22,300
kits available which contain all the

1125
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,730
necessary components to create an

1126
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:27,130
analogous setter look ukt protocols and

1127
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,710
they I've seen some go for around two

1128
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:30,460
and a half thousand pounds which

1129
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,630
relatively compared to like an actual

1130
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,900
full gun want some love this

1131
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:37,420
ridiculously cheap however we can go

1132
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,700
cheaper with virtualization you can

1133
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,260
model the protocols and opponents we can

1134
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,390
leave bridge the quantum cloud for

1135
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:45,250
example which allows for the exploration

1136
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:47,560
of quantum applications fire systems and

1137
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:50,710
simulators to muzzle and test qkd

1138
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:52,480
particles utilizing real-world ones and

1139
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:53,680
sisters however this was pointed out to

1140
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,230
me so I should stress

1141
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,330
please don't hack the actual clouds

1142
00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:00,580
platform please use it to model the

1143
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:02,770
protocols and hack the quantum

1144
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:04,360
cryptography side of it leave IBM alone

1145
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:08,320
unless they've asked you to testify I've

1146
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:09,880
got a public blog that we can also use

1147
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,340
software such as MATLAB or Visual Basic

1148
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,500
to model all of our components include

1149
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:16,240
the logic of these protocols and create

1150
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,920
an inexpensive virtual lab that one

1151
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,720
there's quite a lot of material

1152
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,380
available to help in such a death

1153
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:26,118
and there are actually several academic

1154
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,040
research papers that used this

1155
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:28,880
virtualization approach and published in

1156
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,190
peer-reviewed journals

1157
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,200
my personal recommendation would be to

1158
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:36,250
start with a virtual lab and once you've

1159
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,810
identified poster once you've identified

1160
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:41,030
potential vulnerabilities then build an

1161
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:42,410
analogous physical model to determine

1162
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,089
how best to exploit the issues

1163
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:46,339
identified and also whether they

1164
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:54,619
constitute digits of a vulnerability and

1165
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:57,230
if so under what conditions sound in

1166
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:58,400
conclusion there is no better physical

1167
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,680
medium for storing and processing

1168
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,070
information then quantum systems

1169
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,779
according to quantum information theory

1170
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:07,220
quantum cryptography can be secured on

1171
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,290
the physical level and there are many

1172
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,828
probes but also several quads and

1173
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:14,029
physical handles yet to overcome

1174
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:15,619
commercial systems relying on quantum

1175
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,329
principles are already beginning to

1176
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:22,820
emerge as we've seen and can be tested

1177
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:25,040
as we also see and while several

1178
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,200
protocols are securing them there exists

1179
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,150
many pentesting applications in the

1180
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,189
physical implementations of such systems

1181
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:33,349
the landscape of cryptography is

1182
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:34,550
changing under our feet and it's up to

1183
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:36,829
us to adapt to it

1184
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:39,290
for the introduction of new protocols

1185
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:40,940
some completely secure and though this

1186
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:43,240
still exists many pentesting

1187
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:46,430
applications in the physical

1188
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:48,529
implementations of subsystems if you

1189
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:50,810
can't find an inherent flaw look for an

1190
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:52,280
implementation for what components were

1191
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:54,560
used in the construction of the system

1192
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,930
what were their technical limitations

1193
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:59,450
how can these limitations be abused and

1194
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:00,950
protected against technical details for

1195
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:03,169
many components are publicly available

1196
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:05,359
and so research into the compromise of

1197
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:12,410
these devices can be done without ever

1198
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:14,810
having to need one in front of you so

1199
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:16,520
here are some various further reading

1200
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:19,910
slides these were all really useful in

1201
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:21,530
the construction of this talk and also

1202
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:23,000
provide more detail into the circuit

1203
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:24,760
areas than I've been able to go through

1204
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,170
in just an hour

1205
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,750
how are the obligatory image references

1206
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:32,030
just so no one shouts at me and I'd also

1207
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:33,200
like to thank Cyprus for allowing me the

1208
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,710
time and resources to put this

1209
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,810
presentation

1210
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:37,010
together they'd be brilliant

1211
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,540
particularly I'd like to thank also mark

1212
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:40,280
Prather Catherine Freneau in London's

1213
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,020
Brad for their guidance of encouragement

1214
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,940
besides Manchester for providing such a

1215
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:54,680
stellar platform and you will listening

1216
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:56,060
patiently thank you very much I think we

1217
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,230
should try to get this mic up on running

1218
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:00,190
through through Kansas anyone go any

1219
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:07,450
questions right well okay

1220
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:10,130
Scott the most gorgeous man in InfoSec I

1221
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:12,859
can't ask you a question after that you

1222
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:14,510
mentioned the AES is currently

1223
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:16,940
considered to be quantum resistant is

1224
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:19,490
that with 128 bits much record we have

1225
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:21,109
to go higher so it's to do with I don't

1226
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:23,899
know the introduces there but I know

1227
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:32,779
it's it's quantum resistive in the same

1228
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:35,119
way that one can control a lot of

1229
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:38,060
computers won't have any extra power but

1230
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,190
it's not yeah it's not using say I'm

1231
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:42,710
number factorization where was the Jesus

1232
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:45,170
have an obvious benefit and so if it's

1233
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:47,630
secure against their classical system a

1234
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,130
yes it should also be secure against a

1235
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:55,250
quantum system is it shouldn't be able

1236
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:56,710
to crack it much faster thanks so much

1237
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:59,390
I'm told I really enjoyed it

1238
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:01,609
we've every cause I'm a computer it

1239
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:03,500
tends to be a logarithm not a

1240
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:05,509
logarithmic improvement an integer

1241
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:09,680
factorization sighs it seems to be

1242
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:11,599
jumped last time I checked it the

1243
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,490
largest number of quantum computer to

1244
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:19,849
factorize ins 14 do you know what the

1245
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:22,368
numbers they came from Jones knows so I

1246
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:24,849
don't know exactly what we've gone up to

1247
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:28,070
it changes by quickie but I do know

1248
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:30,260
after the main estimate again lets peek

1249
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:33,770
into that and but estimates and guesses

1250
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:35,930
that we would need around four thousand

1251
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,040
cubits with a good architecture and good

1252
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,980
noise reduction and error code

1253
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,190
Corrections to get to crack something

1254
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:45,650
like RSA 204 eight so we're still away

1255
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:48,319
off but

1256
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:51,589
it's we have in quantum pieces we have

1257
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:54,200
like a version of Moore's law happening

1258
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:55,609
so it shouldn't take as scary as 4000

1259
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,319
cubic something as massive as it's done

1260
00:49:55,609 --> 00:50:02,440
it shouldn't take a great amount of time

1261
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:08,900
together any more questions

1262
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:12,109
no okay with Tom period this bit more of

1263
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:13,700
a simple world book what really will the

1264
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,680
end product be light for just the

1265
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:18,680
general public more than the private

1266
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:21,980
sensors and all that so it really

1267
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,480
depends on where and how far

1268
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,299
breakthroughs happen within quantum

1269
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,950
cryptography so far with qkd and stuff

1270
00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:29,750
you're very much right and saying it's a

1271
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:31,189
lot of private sector stuff and we're

1272
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,440
not going to really see a lot of that

1273
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:35,450
happening for us it's it's really

1274
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,779
whether we can get some of the smaller

1275
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:43,069
fields say enter your education and

1276
00:50:38,779 --> 00:50:44,299
stuff like that how many how much room

1277
00:50:43,069 --> 00:50:45,770
we give it to grow and how much funding

1278
00:50:44,299 --> 00:50:48,710
the giver and kind of a legs on that

1279
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:52,250
it's really quite to be able to kind of

1280
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:55,369
predict on the public citizen side but

1281
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:58,069
what I would say is even if we don't get

1282
00:50:55,369 --> 00:51:00,890
there very soon with quantum photography

1283
00:50:58,069 --> 00:51:03,920
it's very promising with post quantum

1284
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:06,020
cryptography that will get things like

1285
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,529
securing your home computer on the

1286
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:14,779
internet and going from TLS to some post

1287
00:51:09,529 --> 00:51:19,670
quantum cryptography solution since any

1288
00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:22,990
more questions for your mom no okay

1289
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:22,990
thanks again anyway
