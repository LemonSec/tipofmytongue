1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,928
hello how we doing I'm already flee

2
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:12,940
after party yeah

3
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:15,549
we've survived nearly a full day besides

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,119
well done so my talk today

5
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:20,439
I like big box we're gonna talk about

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,539
automated threats against web

7
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,660
applications specifically those looking

8
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:27,640
for attacks against business logic what

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,039
interested me when I was looking at what

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,869
to present the b-sides was I did a a

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,160
webinar with Scott helm who thank you

12
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:34,120
for not going to see is talk about the

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,538
way it's very kind of you

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,680
his ego is big enough already but I did

15
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,300
a joint webinar with him and we got

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,100
talking about the box threats and he was

17
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,480
saying oh yeah but you know we solve

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,640
this with capture or we do this with

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,050
rate-limiting and we started in this

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,030
conversation I actually realized that

21
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,410
there's a lot of people who make

22
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,149
assumptions about the way that these

23
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,608
automated threats attack website and

24
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:56,050
build web applications a certain way and

25
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:57,699
they don't always think about it in

26
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,030
terms of the risks the business that

27
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:02,620
these different types of attack pose so

28
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,879
as a full disclosure I work for a

29
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,580
company called Metis here based in

30
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:08,530
Manchester and we use a combination of

31
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,590
weblog analysis and machine learning to

32
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,960
look for automated behavior and help

33
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,000
retailers gambling sites came in

34
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,829
companies travel agencies prevent these

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,320
automated attacks things like credential

36
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:22,059
stuffing against their websites so this

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,470
is a bit of a sort of tour of some of

38
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,390
the weird and wonderful things that I've

39
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,310
come across in my research over the past

40
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,649
few months and just really a bit of a

41
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,810
thought piece around how you can think

42
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:33,939
about these type of attacks if you are

43
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,220
building web applications if you have a

44
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:38,529
business that runs online and you know

45
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,880
you've maybe seen some fraud or weird

46
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,740
behavior going on there and trying to

47
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,810
work out what's going on maybe some of

48
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,189
the things you can look for and some of

49
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,479
the common stumbling blocks where people

50
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,789
will try and put in some sort of

51
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,820
mitigation to stop an attack and

52
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,350
actually depending on what information

53
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,119
the attacker is after and how Volleyball

54
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,890
the information within your site is to

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,920
them they might then just work around

56
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:02,409
that in a in a novel way so we'll start

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,390
off with what is a bot what do people

58
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:06,430
think about there is well definition

59
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,110
there it's an automated program

60
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,000
autonomous program on a network

61
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,620
some people think about chat BOTS about

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,720
gaming BOTS and all that kind of thing

63
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,030
but this is specifically just some sort

64
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,310
of automated interaction with the

65
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:23,739
website usually simulating the behavior

66
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,970
of a real user so my research findings

67
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:26,409
which are obviously skewed because I

68
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,480
work for a bot management company so the

69
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:30,040
people we talk to generally have some

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,679
form of bot problem so your mileage may

71
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,629
vary but the websites that I've been

72
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,760
looking at around 53 percent of the

73
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:40,599
traffic hitting that website that API

74
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:44,048
that mobile API whatever it is is a bot

75
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:46,510
good that gray indifferent doesn't

76
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,069
matter it is evolved and when we start

77
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,769
to work with the clients of those around

78
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:53,619
61% of that 53 if you can do the maths

79
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:54,940
feel free are unwanted they don't want

80
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,470
them on there they're just using

81
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,090
resource they're trying to break into

82
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,950
things they're trying to view systems

83
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,290
they're trying to conduct nefarious

84
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,358
activities and it's not always just some

85
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,120
evil cyber criminal if we think about

86
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:08,950
the world of retail it could be a

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,000
competitor trying to get pricing there's

88
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,540
all sorts of different weird and

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,129
wonderful things that go on with BOTS

90
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,260
and what's really quite frightening is

91
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:18,518
when we look at in retail and travel

92
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,280
specifically when we look at the

93
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,530
attempts to log into their sites 9 out

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,900
of 10 login attempts of the sites that

95
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,329
I've been looking at from March to July

96
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,299
have been from automated credential

97
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:32,950
stuffing or account takeover systems so

98
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:35,530
huge amount of traffic huge amount of

99
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,060
results going in there to feed things to

100
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,010
give things information back that

101
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,859
potentially you don't want that's not a

102
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:45,220
real customer that's someone else trying

103
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:47,530
to trick a system so in simple terms

104
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,419
what do we have we have a normal user

105
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,139
they have a browser they make a request

106
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:54,790
to website fairly simple but what we can

107
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,769
do of course is we add some script to

108
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,388
that we had some automation there are

109
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,790
various frameworks for doing this you

110
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:02,139
can use the tools that many of you may

111
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,388
have come across to do testing on

112
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:05,470
websites if you do QA internally and

113
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,910
house if you build web apps

114
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,190
you probably automate a lot of your

115
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,239
testing tools like selenium all these

116
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,430
kind of different things that are out

117
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,230
there so you I didn't a bit of script

118
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,130
and suddenly you can make lots of

119
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:21,130
requests very fast that's the basic bot

120
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,110
that's out there has anyone had any

121
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,150
issues with boss has anyone come across

122
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:29,320
them so what kind of box do you see

123
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:30,758
that anyone take it in yeah so that's a

124
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,889
great example the ticketing industry

125
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,630
gets a lot of flack for box and it's

126
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,250
interesting for them because they're you

127
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,380
know people want to buy tickets to see

128
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,490
the new Act but then ticket touts want

129
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,350
to be able to buy this very quickly

130
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,449
there's often secondary sites where you

131
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,460
can resell those and the ticketing

132
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,770
market is interesting because even the

133
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,810
online tickets the QR code things that

134
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,940
you try and do there's even the people

135
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,050
who sell tools for trying to snipe those

136
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,300
tickets and buy them up very quickly

137
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,070
also sell tools often for amending the

138
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,479
QR codes that the detail looks different

139
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,830
so you know these things I says you've

140
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,750
got to bring idea this is you name an

141
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,669
address people will sell you for a few

142
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,139
hundred quid a tool that can repurpose

143
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,580
those and print out an exactly

144
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,070
legitimate looking one for maybe like

145
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,270
the o2 in London and here is your ticket

146
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,010
and we've put them whatever name and

147
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,659
address you want whatever ID and was

148
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,889
tampered with a QR code to make it look

149
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,990
real so there's some interesting ones

150
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:22,060
with that any good box that people have

151
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:24,190
on their websites no Google price

152
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,030
scrapers aggregators you had you end up

153
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:31,690
was that a bad one in your paper click

154
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:34,000
yeah so yeah absolutely so you know you

155
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,199
get all sorts of bad fraud things I'm

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,389
gonna go start going through a few of

157
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,770
these yeah so you get search engines you

158
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,659
get things like uptime checker so you

159
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,580
know these services you subscribe to to

160
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:44,349
say is my website or visit performing

161
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,240
you might have some security scanning

162
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:47,590
tools that fire off to your website and

163
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,750
scan it and check if there's any known

164
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,710
vulnerabilities sequel injection from

165
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,990
web systems

166
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,719
he might have part the services you

167
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,580
might work with third parties or

168
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,169
business partners who need to get

169
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,240
information from your site to resell

170
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,948
your goods or services so they might be

171
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,840
using automated tools to go and query an

172
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:08,169
API or even just scrape in your wegs

173
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,580
website aggregators price comparison you

174
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,840
know a lot of these things when we go on

175
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,280
and we want to see what's the cheapest

176
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,650
price we can get for something they're

177
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,840
constantly scraping sites looking for

178
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,370
this information so there's a retailer

179
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,469
you might want to be on these you might

180
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,000
not so this is the interesting thing

181
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,889
with box that you can't always just say

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,180
this is a list of the ones I want this

183
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,400
is a list of the ones that are good and

184
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,800
bad because what's good to one business

185
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,030
might be bad to another and then on the

186
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,229
bad box side of things things like

187
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,489
spinner BOTS and these are kind of

188
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:35,349
interesting this is at the idea of

189
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,750
inventory hoarding and if you're

190
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:38,469
interested in this a link and do some

191
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,720
things around

192
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,610
rages attacks and the interesting things

193
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,930
that can happen but things like spinner

194
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,540
BOTS are interesting because an attacker

195
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,890
builds a bot while say an attacker a lot

196
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,540
of this stuff is a gray area a lot of

197
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,729
this stuff is legal because you for this

198
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,530
great websites you can do things but if

199
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,660
you've registered for this event today

200
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,099
he went through Eventbrite you put a

201
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,290
ticket in a basket you have to wait

202
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,700
about 20 minutes you know with it you

203
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,650
have to check it out within about 20

204
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,990
minutes the reason you have to put 20

205
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,239
minute wait times on is someone will see

206
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,120
an event or they will see a product or

207
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,080
they will see a ticket for a flight they

208
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,670
will put it in a basket

209
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,200
hold it there keep it in the basket

210
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,210
whilst they're trying to resell it on

211
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,920
another site they'll only go through the

212
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,479
checkout process once they've resold it

213
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,370
on the other site for a profit

214
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,520
that could be quite a small margin they

215
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,690
could be making a pound per transaction

216
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,830
but this causes you a problem because

217
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,780
you're trying to sell an airline ticket

218
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,770
and it looks like all your inventory is

219
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,719
exhausted because it's in people's

220
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,310
baskets you can't have 10 people

221
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,630
checkout the same seat on a flight at

222
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,370
the same time so you have to hold it for

223
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,500
a period of time but these bots are

224
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,560
constantly trying to recycle this same

225
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,060
with ticketing you might add a ticket

226
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,700
for an event you know there's a flash

227
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,010
sale you managed to get 100 of them in

228
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,539
the queue with different IP addresses or

229
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,740
something you hold them there you sell

230
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,690
them on a third party site since you've

231
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,100
sold them you check them out so from

232
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,750
your point of view there's no risk

233
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,940
because you're only buying it once

234
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,470
you've sold it for a profit and of

235
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,520
course you can scale that you know with

236
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,100
the cloud with all these different

237
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,299
resources that out there very quickly

238
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,430
but as the person trying to sell tickets

239
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,229
or trying to sell airline tickets or

240
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,660
whatever is your inventory can become

241
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:12,219
exhausted so with shopping and retailing

242
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,780
you know there have been cases where

243
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,640
retailers have actually used this

244
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,500
against the competition to make it look

245
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,390
like the competition of certain hot

246
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,560
items in stock because they're sticking

247
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,870
them all in baskets making them very

248
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,970
hard for you as a customer to go and buy

249
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,370
them legitimately so BOTS make the

250
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,840
internet really unfair for real people

251
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,210
at the time and of course this is you

252
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,860
stick up a website you start seeing BOTS

253
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,299
whether you want them or not they're

254
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,969
just constantly scraping the Internet a

255
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,199
lot the time content harvesting that

256
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,659
don't if anyone's come across this but

257
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,400
this is a big one if you write quality

258
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,319
content a blog and newspaper or

259
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,540
something like that quite often people

260
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,890
will come along there's a big set up in

261
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,839
China for this where they will scrape

262
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,030
sites they'll put them up on a very

263
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,470
similar-looking news site

264
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,670
and they'll just have adverts on the

265
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,440
sides and they're making money off

266
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,599
presenting your content

267
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,880
perhaps gated content they might buy one

268
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,500
accountant and stick it up there so if

269
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,510
you're a newspaper with premium content

270
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,710
steal your articles stick them up as

271
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,950
soon as someone's searching for a hot

272
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:10,420
topic he's throwing money on me

273
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,010
someone's searching for a hot topic it

274
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,089
comes up you've gone there they're

275
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,800
getting money off the advertising

276
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,540
revenue so it's your intellectual

277
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,270
properties your stuff that's been

278
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,880
scraped and put on somewhere else take

279
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,050
your thing bots we just can't talk about

280
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,640
account takeover is probably the one

281
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,079
that most people have seen in the news

282
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,260
of late

283
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,960
this idea of controls online people

284
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,160
constantly reuse usernames and passwords

285
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,600
so we'll take those we'll stick them

286
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,089
against different sites and use them to

287
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,230
access goods services personal

288
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,060
information I'll go into there's a

289
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,070
little bit more in a second but there

290
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,380
are so many different variants of

291
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,330
account takeover boxes it's just crazy

292
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,350
some are broad-brush tagged in lots of

293
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,300
different sites some are built

294
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,180
specifically for high-value goods and

295
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,030
services scraping just getting pricing

296
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,680
information sneaker bots so until I

297
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,240
started at net to see it I'd never come

298
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,000
across these so now I'm come across

299
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,140
sneaker bots yeah you see here a stylish

300
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,600
kind of guy you've got the Hat you've

301
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,819
got the glasses this is the thing with

302
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,350
sneaker box people have these high

303
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,850
volume trainers that they go after these

304
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,740
limited releases or these kind of

305
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,910
different things that go on this is a

306
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,980
world that I've never come across before

307
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,329
but this huge amounts of money to be

308
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,640
made in people trade them like

309
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,410
commodities on the stock exchange so

310
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,030
there's a huge amount of tools all of

311
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,370
which seem to be developing c-sharp for

312
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,689
some reason you no idea why I don't know

313
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,240
is about Don they're developers and

314
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,190
trainers but you see all these things

315
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,290
and they're going after so if you're a

316
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,120
website selling some trainers and you're

317
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,339
gonna you know make a few quid on

318
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,290
selling then that's great you obviously

319
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,880
want them to be sold out the problem is

320
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,250
a few teenagers in their bedrooms are

321
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,230
basically firing a bot now you to try

322
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,640
and buy them before anyone else so

323
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,380
instead of a few customers refreshing a

324
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,199
page you have one fifteen-year-old in a

325
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,640
bedroom with a tulip or firing thousands

326
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,650
and thousands of requests you're under

327
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,270
DDoS attack if you're on some sort of

328
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,610
shared hosting or platform which a lot

329
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,170
of retailers are you know Shopify and

330
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,060
things like that you can cause a major

331
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,469
problem to them than other retailers so

332
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,479
although it's great that they sell out

333
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,540
of things quickly just because a

334
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,920
teenager wants a pair

335
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,380
trainers and I'm saying teenagers it

336
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,759
could be anyone to be fair but they are

337
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,250
phenomenally ugly trainers some of these

338
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:14,540
things they're going after them such a

339
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,579
great rate there's there's a volume of

340
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,990
traffic hitting your site and how do you

341
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:19,250
tell what's real and what's not and

342
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,290
there are various checks people try and

343
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,970
put in place but especially in retail

344
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,469
you don't want to do anything that slows

345
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,850
down that user journey that makes it

346
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,170
harder for someone to check out because

347
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,980
they'll just go somewhere else a lot of

348
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:33,139
the time account creators so again this

349
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,449
is often related to sneaker box but a

350
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:37,100
lot of websites offer limited releases

351
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:38,630
or they'll offer raffles or they'll

352
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,399
offer something like that where by

353
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,620
creating more accounts you have an

354
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,730
advantage so again people automate this

355
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,199
and if you look there's lots of things

356
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,540
online like better nightbot and all

357
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:49,008
these other services and software that's

358
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,810
out there that is designed for

359
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:53,120
automating this process if creating lots

360
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,758
of fake accounts to maximize your chance

361
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,990
of copying some new kicks I use the air

362
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,269
quotes because I don't feel comfortable

363
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,470
saying though carving is another

364
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:03,709
interesting one still in credit-card

365
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,509
details you have a small website and

366
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:07,189
you're selling some legitimate small

367
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:09,740
goods you're crafting some things nicer

368
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,750
paintings or something like that but you

369
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,209
have their page where someone can enter

370
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,040
card details attackers search the

371
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:17,810
internet for these so as a retailer if

372
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,519
you have a way that people can get to a

373
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,949
add a new card to their account page

374
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,370
very easily people use this to verify

375
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:27,469
dumps of stolen credit card data or even

376
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,209
worse for you is when they don't know

377
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,709
the full credit card details so they

378
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:33,109
know the number they know the expiry

379
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:35,149
date but they don't know the cv2 code on

380
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,560
the back well it's three digits let's

381
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,839
have a bot cracked up for us

382
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,510
fire it when it comes up with valid card

383
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,889
details great that one works so that's a

384
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,380
huge problem to you because not only is

385
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:47,240
your website being ddosed but your card

386
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,709
payment provider might get very annoyed

387
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,389
that you're being used as part of

388
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:53,089
fraudulent transactions that they can

389
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:54,260
link you to or maybe you're a retailer

390
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:55,850
and when they validate that the card is

391
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,069
real there then I use that to buy gift

392
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,209
cards or something else and then you get

393
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,889
charged back so fraud

394
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,930
your card payment provider gets very

395
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:04,279
annoyed they find you and when you come

396
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,349
to a new suddenly your cost of

397
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,389
processing card transactions skyrockets

398
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,769
so just because you've added the basic

399
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:11,000
functionality in the modern major being

400
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:14,120
able to buy something online using a

401
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,319
credit card you're being attacked and if

402
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,120
we look at the businesses that are out

403
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:19,120
there they've hit the news in the past

404
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,490
year or so around this there's a real

405
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,650
weird mix of companies out here this

406
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,779
isn't just banks which people often

407
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,420
assume this isn't just high-volume

408
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:31,360
assets Dunkin Donuts has been hit twice

409
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,740
in the past year ready for it

410
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,250
even as the donut company the culture

411
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,400
look Oh clapping OH

412
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,680
[Music]

413
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,420
swing-and-a-miss OkCupid turbo taps

414
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,040
delivering all sorts of weird and

415
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,900
wonderful companies out there if you've

416
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,439
seen delivery justy there's been a lot

417
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,699
of things where people have been using

418
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,050
credentials to log into someone's

419
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,850
account then saying this food was

420
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,680
terrible I want a refund getting the

421
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,270
refund then using that to do nada or if

422
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,310
they've got credit card details stored

423
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,949
maybe ordering food there's been all

424
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,790
these things where someone was buying

425
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,710
there's a great one where someone was

426
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,480
complaining that someone has broken into

427
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,910
my account and they had the all they

428
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,440
could do was buy cigarettes and beer

429
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,730
from me source and they were on one of

430
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,110
these delivery services and they were

431
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,210
complaining the attacker of no taste

432
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,760
whatsoever but it's weird and wonderful

433
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:17,050
things like this and again you know as a

434
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,460
security professional we might just be

435
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,500
set here screaming going to factor

436
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,940
authentication or something like that

437
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,650
off capture or things like that but

438
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,260
again these people operate in a very

439
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,730
competitive marketplace and if they do

440
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,439
that district user journey means that

441
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,250
they'll go to briefs or someone apps

442
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,630
becomes quite difficult HSBC is

443
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,950
obviously Nest was a funny one you see

444
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,750
these companies have hit the news saying

445
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,910
they've been hacked and you often see

446
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,860
this carding hack cutting it out all

447
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,870
these things account takeover there's

448
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,390
often word hack involved in breach and

449
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,580
these companies who effectively have

450
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,830
suffered the wrath of a user using

451
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,779
password 1-2-3 and the same email thief

452
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,540
used for everything are suddenly being

453
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:57,970
introduced into the news into media as

454
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,500
being breached and attacked and you kind

455
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,959
of think well maybe that's a bit unfair

456
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,010
but his huge PR damage nest was an

457
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,479
interesting one there was a case where

458
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,950
someone who claimed that nest had

459
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,690
clearly been hacked and breached and

460
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,400
actually this lady had just hears her

461
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,920
normal his name password that's used for

462
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,089
everything else and some person had

463
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,560
thought it was very funny to log into

464
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:16,690
her account and start yelling after

465
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,040
through the cameras that there was a

466
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,440
missile strike coming into San Francisco

467
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,939
and she panicked and threatened to sue

468
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,940
nest and all this kind of wonderful

469
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,480
stuff happens reputational damage just

470
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:30,820
because they've used a rubbish password

471
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,230
spot if I really call example streaming

472
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,670
services all these kind of things

473
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,390
they're an interesting one because

474
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:39,010
they're kind of a two-prong problem one

475
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,680
part of the problem is that these

476
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:45,010
accounts hold value especially anyone

477
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,349
got a spotify family account yeah one

478
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,330
person to pick a few people I bet you

479
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,800
don't use all of the allotted slots is

480
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,660
it six here I think there's a Spotify

481
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,880
family account so usually people have

482
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,469
empty slots if you've used the same

483
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,790
password for anything else have a look

484
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,040
when you get home and log in and see if

485
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,930
those have been sold usually we can find

486
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,880
at least one person who's had that

487
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,760
happen to them sometimes several times

488
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,740
true story friend of mine and had it

489
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,510
happened then they got their other

490
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,150
accounts in their Spotify family thing

491
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:15,250
sold on some attacker then got greedy

492
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,630
and actually sold on their master

493
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,590
account that the main account was

494
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,050
associated with it

495
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,370
smart speakers play music and even if

496
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,439
you're on a remote device you can take

497
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,420
over control of playlists stare at

498
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,370
homelessness and music suddenly cradle

499
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,839
the fills comes on if you've not heard

500
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,840
of if the bank Cradle of Filth do not

501
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,060
google it but then you end up in this

502
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,680
weird DJ battle with someone trying to

503
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,530
listen things someone I work with

504
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,939
currently she found out her account had

505
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,439
been hacked for a streaming service

506
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,960
because every time she logged in the

507
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,000
language had been changed to Spanish and

508
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,210
someone was watching streaming videos

509
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,740
using her account so you know weird and

510
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,880
wonderful things like that the second

511
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,560
problem and this was covered at Def Con

512
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,570
this year and it's really interesting is

513
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,500
what happens when you ring up the bank

514
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,870
and start doing the security

515
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,120
verification one of the questions they

516
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,670
tend to ask you is what's a recent

517
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,260
charge that's gone out of your account

518
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,490
so if you can take someone's username

519
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,129
password that the use for everything

520
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,780
find a few accounts that they use get

521
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,250
access to them you don't need to do

522
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,069
anything with them other than say I know

523
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,390
999 goes out on the 26th of a month so

524
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,069
when I ring up the bank could pretend to

525
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,420
be them I can give you this list of all

526
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,849
these services all these payments that

527
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,290
are going out you know you can see the

528
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,909
last four digits the account it was

529
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,699
associated with you can start to use

530
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,410
these as basically free intelligent

531
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:31,120
source so you can build up a picture of

532
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,380
someone taking starting just with a

533
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,360
compromised username and password

534
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,370
through a lot of online services

535
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,540
something's bound to stick and then you

536
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:39,909
can start to get their home address

537
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,750
their date of birth recent financial

538
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:46,750
transactions all this kind of thing

539
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,250
some of the examples up there Transport

540
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,040
for London took down their services

541
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,480
earlier on to think it was it was very

542
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,790
recently

543
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,140
yeah dates on the 8th of August because

544
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,190
they were suffering credential stuffing

545
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,270
attack and they got a lot of grief for

546
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,950
this people saying well if you can't

547
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,200
handle this and all this kind of thing

548
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,240
but these attacks can be massively

549
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,800
volumetric then you know they're just

550
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,410
throwing throwing day trays so every

551
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,270
time there's a new source of needed dump

552
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,800
of credentials out there you can make

553
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,180
them a problem for you and things like

554
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,740
software licenses you know if you've

555
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,210
ever been on these websites or you go an

556
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,490
eBay and someone selling a cheap office

557
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,530
license sometimes these things can come

558
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,990
because an attacker has bought some that

559
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,330
they can catch out very quickly you know

560
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,280
they'll break into gaming accounts to

561
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,020
get you know the loot boxes or whatever

562
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,180
it is you've built up in your collection

563
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,520
you know online gaming is a very popular

564
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,480
competitive thing there a lot and I'm

565
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,220
not going to blend teenagers again

566
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,350
because that's just mean but there's a

567
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,670
lot of teenagers who are just going

568
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,899
online and they want to steal things for

569
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,220
other people's accounts a lot of the

570
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,260
time you can't trace where these things

571
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,880
have gone to in games so you steal all

572
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,680
their swords and possessions and magic

573
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,860
wands transfer them to your account jobs

574
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,270
a Goodman and cheese this is all the

575
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,610
weirdest fraud stories I ever heard

576
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:57,220
where someone found there's a cheese

577
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,990
wholesaler who was having fake card

578
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,940
details process through the carding

579
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,070
system so basically people were using it

580
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,600
to validate stolen card details then

581
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,980
when they found that was the valid they

582
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,080
tried to order cheese for same-day

583
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,580
collection and if you think about a lot

584
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,870
of those things that are out there where

585
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,639
you can order something can go collect

586
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,770
it from a physical store if you can use

587
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,990
a stolen credit card or account go and

588
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,760
pick up a TV or large lump of cheese

589
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,250
round we're talking like four

590
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,840
restaurants here walk out sell it for

591
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,580
cash value and then you've made a profit

592
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,590
from a username and password you found

593
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,149
on the internet so you know there's only

594
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,250
weird things that happen by people

595
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,870
trying to cash out and initially when I

596
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,700
started noticing I started looking into

597
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,290
this I thought we've all heard of this

598
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,730
you know it's all on the dark web and

599
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,830
these secret market places now

600
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,350
infiltrate them or now do all this cool

601
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:43,360
research and then I found just by

602
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,760
googling you can find shops like bread

603
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,709
shoppers this isn't on the dark web this

604
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,920
is a normal website where you can buy

605
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,480
and sell stolen accounts technically

606
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,179
they'll say it's accounts you don't

607
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,769
really need to use

608
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:59,429
or account you don't have where you know

609
00:19:55,769 --> 00:20:00,869
you want to just sell on but if we start

610
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:01,440
to dig into break up and look at what

611
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:03,418
they're selling

612
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,950
oh look don't condone this wonder why

613
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,710
they've had to credential stuffing

614
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:10,259
attacks resulted in account breaches and

615
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:13,350
again you can go and buy loyalty point

616
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:14,549
schemes for Starbucks subway UK and

617
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,129
Ireland subway so you know this isn't

618
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:20,070
them an American problem necessary but

619
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:21,748
for a fraction of the retail value so

620
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,129
you go on you can buy some still on

621
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:25,139
accounts or some points can be

622
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:27,299
transferred to you you can go in and buy

623
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:29,340
physical goods in the store a fraction

624
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:32,029
of the price because they give you a

625
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,408
login username and password that's valid

626
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:35,970
the other thing is these aren't just

627
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:37,200
like fly-by-nights these are people

628
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,879
who've built a business model around

629
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,980
this they offer support they will say if

630
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:43,049
it's doesn't work for you we'll give you

631
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,700
a replacement within so many doubt you

632
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:45,990
know you've got 24 hours to use it if

633
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,330
it's not valid when you're sorted out

634
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:52,940
for you and you won't been on holiday

635
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:54,470
this year anyone knows yeah I was it

636
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,490
sorry

637
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,190
Florida lovely so you could have gone

638
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,950
there at a fraction of the price thirty

639
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,679
percent of retail and again this is

640
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,369
break into point schemes using

641
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,559
combinations of usernames and passwords

642
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:10,590
and then reselling those on and what

643
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,389
they do is they hoard point schemes from

644
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,340
hundreds of thousands of accounts so

645
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:15,779
they have a bank of them and this has

646
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,519
really taken uptick since all the

647
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:19,440
Bitcoin instability where people used to

648
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,779
hold things like Bitcoin so quite often

649
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,119
now holding loyalty points because they

650
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:26,610
can do this so they can buy a flight at

651
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:28,889
the very last minute for you or a hotel

652
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,149
or a travel package by the time you've

653
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:31,860
got on the flight gone off or you've

654
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:33,689
stayed in the hotel that night by the

655
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,799
time the fraud team picks it up and two

656
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,960
three weeks later they realized

657
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,879
something's gone on and being told I'm

658
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,200
off-camera sorry by the time they

659
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:43,769
realize something's gone on you've

660
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,450
disappeared so what happens well someone

661
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:47,399
has to pay for it so the Blue Point

662
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,350
scheme has to pay off the hotel and then

663
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:50,969
they have to refund the customer whose

664
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,918
account Smith whose account has been

665
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,600
stolen and they get hit twice with it so

666
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,860
it's a really expensive thing to happen

667
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,260
if you're running one of these schemes

668
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,899
and there are actually huge amounts of

669
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,890
now dark web travel agents so when we

670
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:09,610
start looking to it they are fantastic

671
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:11,110
branding so this is one of my favorites

672
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,879
I always liked finding weird art

673
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,350
websites they used to be one for a run

674
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,910
somewhere strain that we tracked in our

675
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,830
malware labs for a long time and they

676
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,120
had a pumpkin with a Ferrari logo on it

677
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:22,629
like a pumpkin carriage with a Ferrari

678
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,969
logo wonderful anyway so patriarchy

679
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,830
travel here who obviously you know with

680
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,780
the Russian Orthodox Church and Mercedes

681
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:30,550
and luxury jets and visit all parts of

682
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,690
the world but you start to dig into

683
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,310
these things and they're offering all

684
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,140
these things it's 30% off

685
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,360
you see people talking about you know

686
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,150
the reputation within this scene and

687
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,530
here we have someone selling multi-point

688
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,840
schemes and actually what we've noticed

689
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,040
is there's more and more entrance to

690
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,510
this market and actually driving the

691
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,230
price down so these people are selling

692
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,629
accounts 5% of retail value points cubes

693
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,250
so they're just you know just giving

694
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,510
them away basically so you can get

695
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,800
access these loyalty point schemes that

696
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,450
you can then use to do all sorts of

697
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,790
other things they'll tell you they have

698
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,260
five thousand you know feedback

699
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,610
reputations they will give you the

700
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,810
crunches if they don't work they'll sort

701
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,909
you some others out they will guarantee

702
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,960
things for you they are certified you

703
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:11,020
know these are people with good

704
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,610
reputations on these online services so

705
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,810
it's really quite interesting when it

706
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,100
starts to dig into this and they

707
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,600
specifically call out that you know

708
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,159
they're worried about the fluctuations

709
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,740
and volatility Bitcoin when you're

710
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,230
paying for these and it can it drive

711
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,600
something sneaker box which we talked

712
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,790
about briefly so sites like stock X now

713
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,830
stock X is interesting legitimate site

714
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,659
selling goods and services but you can

715
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,460
see they're tracking people's different

716
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,590
users market volumes so that you have

717
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,540
trainers and watches and designer things

718
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,919
there's a company called supreme who in

719
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,170
my research I discovered they sell a

720
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,210
brick a household brick was the supreme

721
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:46,030
word supreme down it and it sells for a

722
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:48,070
hundred pounds so normally on incense

723
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,320
maybe who knows maybe I just don't

724
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,909
understand these things but you can go

725
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,500
on these and they have like stock market

726
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,030
checkers so the price of a rare brand of

727
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,920
trainers goes up and down and you know

728
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,660
there's advice on what you should buy

729
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,270
but then the software that you can

730
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,550
actually buy for a few hundred pounds

731
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:05,830
usually it's kind of interesting that

732
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:08,169
you can use this to automate attacks

733
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,850
against as I say tax automating buying

734
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,780
against different shops you put in the

735
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,879
size that

736
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,080
the trainer year one or that sort of

737
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,370
thing and it sits there constantly

738
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,810
holding the site as soon as they're

739
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,399
available it tries to buy them and it

740
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,860
can you give it card details so it will

741
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,510
go through the full checkout process

742
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,919
automatically for you again these are

743
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,530
built in dotnet and what's interesting

744
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,870
is these people who build their software

745
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:31,149
for doing the Box in the higher end of

746
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,770
the sneaker bot market do the same

747
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,810
tricks that the sneaker retailers do

748
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,730
they try and drive scarcity so they do

749
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:39,429
limited releases of their software and

750
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,540
say this software is sold out now you

751
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,770
know someone who's worked in the

752
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,930
software industry I've never come across

753
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,310
software selling out before but they

754
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:46,420
will tell you on their site this

755
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:49,780
particular one is one of the more

756
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,310
popular ones cyber AIO it is sold out

757
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,860
this this particular software were

758
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:55,960
looking at sells for nearly $3,000 I've

759
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,189
seen people advertising out because

760
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,020
they're that desperate to be able to

761
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,000
automate these processes and

762
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:04,810
interestingly enough there's also cloud

763
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,640
services designed to support these so

764
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:09,730
they're doing the same tricks that

765
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,500
people doing real time trading are doing

766
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:13,240
so they're talking about millisecond

767
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,970
advantages they will tell you their data

768
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,190
centers are closest to the data centers

769
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,780
of the retailers that you're looking to

770
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,820
buy from so they're talking up a

771
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:26,350
millisecond advantages and then they're

772
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:28,659
running on a Windows OS but against them

773
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,250
cuz dotnet and Windows so it guarantees

774
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,540
that all sneaker bots are supported

775
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,420
because for some reason they're all

776
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,760
built for Windows but then what happens

777
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,650
is the retailers fight back and they try

778
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,660
and do weird things to throw the box off

779
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,940
so they will put fake listings of that

780
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,830
say hey real human whatever you do don't

781
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,680
buy these trainers this isn't real this

782
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:49,689
is just the left shoe we're selling now

783
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,150
the box don't know this so they will buy

784
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,350
just the left shoe there's a great thing

785
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,780
on Twitter where there's one retailer

786
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,860
who got fed up of these box just buying

787
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,120
up and all the customers complaining

788
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,040
they could never buy these limited

789
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:04,570
releases of trainers so he put up a pair

790
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:06,399
of trainers 9999 dollars and guess what

791
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,480
a bot checked it out straightaway he

792
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,100
actually just put this up as a player

793
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,760
and said don't buy this this is the real

794
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,500
link here interestingly as well if you

795
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,910
look at some of the ways that the

796
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,260
sneaker retailers have tried to get

797
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,090
around this obviously they want to sell

798
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,100
sneakers but they want to kind of make

799
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,929
it fair for people and they'll put in

800
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,320
things like hearing system so you are

801
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,240
held in a position

802
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,820
and some of the Bach tools will offer to

803
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,100
bypass that keifa they know how to put

804
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,350
in basically the right PHP or whatever

805
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,939
web code to add it straight to a basket

806
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:36,320
and check it straight out so there's all

807
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,299
sorts of clever bypasses that they've

808
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,100
started building in and there's one

809
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:42,350
interview with someone who is in the

810
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,209
sneaker bot industry and you know these

811
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,678
are large organizations now and these

812
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,629
are groups of people and they have

813
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,940
basically they do group buys and clip

814
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:51,350
together to cop things that retail and

815
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,659
all this sort of stuff and they said

816
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:56,029
we're at war with that kamae that was

817
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:58,009
his view he saw it as a war with the

818
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:59,539
vendor who was trying to do the CDN and

819
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:02,299
the waffle solution to stop them buying

820
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:03,619
trains as easily so let's do a little

821
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:07,279
bit of an exercise here and how am i

822
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:09,918
doing for time we're doing okay so when

823
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:13,039
I talk to people about how would you

824
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,110
become one of these pop herders

825
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,249
effectively how would you start to do

826
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,049
this and you know when I talk to people

827
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:19,759
I intersect it's often like well I'd

828
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:21,289
start by you know building my own mirai

829
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,240
bottner and then I'd write this code

830
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:24,919
here and then I'd be like doing this

831
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,230
phishing campaign to gather email it

832
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:28,369
gets very complicated very quickly so a

833
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,559
lot of the time people think there's a

834
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:31,879
really huge barrier to entry that it

835
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,529
couldn't just be anyone launching this

836
00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:35,899
attack this is sophisticated attackers

837
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:37,340
so let's have a look at that so we'll

838
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:40,279
start off by trying to find ourselves

839
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,658
some credentials to use online we're

840
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:43,789
going to very carefully make sure we

841
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:47,029
haven't selected Google Image Search and

842
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:48,139
we're going to Google check my dog how

843
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:50,090
we're going to find this nice little

844
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:51,799
Twitter bot here which just trolls

845
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,110
pastebin looking for dumps of green

846
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:57,230
shows so often attackers will put on

847
00:27:54,110 --> 00:28:00,168
samples of larger sets to prove they

848
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:02,059
have good valid details that you can use

849
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:04,039
online so we're just clicking through

850
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:05,480
here and we're seeing huge amounts of

851
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:06,919
accounts hundreds and thousands of

852
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,220
accounts just being kicked out there

853
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:11,749
online so we now have a list of

854
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,149
credentials that we could start to use

855
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:16,340
and of course the big retailers the

856
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:18,049
banks people will always be testing that

857
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,490
but if you can think of a niche service

858
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:21,350
or something that's a little bit off the

859
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,879
beaten track you could try them against

860
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:25,549
that and maybe that's your sweet spot

861
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:26,748
for account takers and if we google

862
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:28,490
combo lists the first thing that comes

863
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:30,259
up is a YouTube tutorial on how to get

864
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:32,450
great combo lists how to sort them out

865
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:34,100
how to do these things so you know just

866
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,470
with a little bit of googling we're

867
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,280
suddenly getting taught how to start in

868
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,040
the world of cyber

869
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,660
and account takeovers now of course we

870
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,520
don't want to do this from our own IP

871
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,220
address we need some sort of proxy to

872
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,930
traffic out through so if we were on for

873
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,120
instance century MBA which is one of the

874
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,320
common account takeover tools we've

875
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,719
maybe go on their forums and there's

876
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,399
people there again offering you know

877
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,320
free proxies there just to try out their

878
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,740
proxy Network they have sometimes these

879
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:03,500
are built from malware infected devices

880
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,910
Internet of Things devices mikrotik

881
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,740
Reuters if I come across another

882
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,360
mikrotik richer I might cry because

883
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,180
they're all seem to be infected with

884
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,669
something or we just find these are the

885
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:16,390
proxy lists that are online so there's

886
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:18,980
plenty of ways for us to very cheaply

887
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:21,110
this case freely become anonymous and

888
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,130
have a list of credentials now how do we

889
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:24,620
automate this how do we put this

890
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:26,330
together well I mentioned century and B

891
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:29,000
either that's one of the tools that was

892
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:31,250
very popular one Long's I'm finding more

893
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,810
interesting moment is sniper again we're

894
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,460
not on the dart lab for any of us so far

895
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,200
we're just on the plane internet we're

896
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,630
going here we found that there's this

897
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,100
account recovery made simple a toolkit

898
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,480
that specifically says it's for using a

899
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:44,600
technique known as credential stuffing

900
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,750
it has a modern UI it has Joe's favorite

901
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,699
angularjs it has all these you know

902
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,940
instant customer service they're always

903
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,830
online it cost $20 in Amazon gift

904
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,020
vouchers you can from $20 of Hung's and

905
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:58,399
gift vouchers you get this tool or you

906
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,230
go on the Pirate Bay and find a crack

907
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,600
version for free if you're doing that

908
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,460
use a VM loads of them about toured with

909
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,649
ransomware nozzles or all the nasty

910
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,690
stuff but what's really interesting with

911
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,720
these tools is they come pre-configured

912
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:13,760
with templates for popular websites they

913
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,290
also have a community program where if

914
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,629
you want to upload your own template for

915
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,350
a particular website you found you can

916
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,090
put that on there

917
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:22,639
and what that does is it basically Maps

918
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:24,110
out the input fields in the output so it

919
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,790
works out wire it needs to stuff the

920
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:27,350
credentials in and then if they can't

921
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:30,170
validate what information needs to pull

922
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:31,939
back out of there so we see a lot of

923
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:34,610
prominent retailers a lot of prominent

924
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,140
websites on there that we can look out

925
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,189
so we'll go through them all but it's

926
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,930
interesting because some of them you see

927
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,940
marked up with things like a silent fail

928
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:42,800
or silent ban so these are retailers who

929
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,790
are trying to stop the counts you've

930
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,350
been able to see whether you've been

931
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,970
successful with your credential stuffing

932
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,860
they're kind of wise to this already in

933
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,450
using different techniques

934
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:55,189
what you'll notice is if you look

935
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:56,960
through the different configure the main

936
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:59,390
website increasingly live

937
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,280
reverse-engineer mobile apps and api's

938
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,990
to go after those so people have put in

939
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,210
all these CAPTCHAs and user behavior

940
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,500
stuff on websites and forgetting that

941
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,120
they've got a mobile app that talks to

942
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,890
an API and the attackers are just

943
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,659
spoofing that user agent and pulling the

944
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,730
data out there while dating credentials

945
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,720
over there when no one's looking and if

946
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:17,240
you look at the trends that are out

947
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,590
there PSD to open banking we're seeing

948
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,200
more and more API is being opened up

949
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,879
where we see in our perimeter extend up

950
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,830
to third parties he'll be taking those

951
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,570
credentials and validating them and it's

952
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,520
really interesting so if you take this

953
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,320
up we're going to do a video recording

954
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,700
of this but you basically put in your

955
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,340
proxy network you put in your list of

956
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,720
username passwords tick the services you

957
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,389
want to try and attack there you know a

958
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,120
lot of those were UK sites

959
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:42,830
UK retailers in this case its room it's

960
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,709
looks at the video streaming service

961
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:49,159
it's checked 168 crowns was per minute

962
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:50,870
using a thousand out of 1,400 proxy is

963
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,640
had two hits and you're seeing where it

964
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,399
says capture at the top is telling you

965
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,110
what those accounts have access to say

966
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,850
or tell your points balance if it's a

967
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,590
loyalty point scheme or a bank balance

968
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,059
or if it's a streaming service it'll

969
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,649
tell you do they have access to the 4k

970
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:04,428
streams or the regular streams are all

971
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,559
this kind of thing

972
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:07,790
so very quickly you have a list of all

973
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,760
the accounts that compromise that you

974
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:12,350
can then go on and sell and there's this

975
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,940
kind of evolution you know this is the

976
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,760
stuff that you can find freely and

977
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,220
easily on the normal internet from you

978
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,860
know basic services that you can just

979
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,150
buy but as we go through it attackers

980
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,559
get more and more sophisticated so

981
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,840
that's kind of the lower tier of the

982
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,950
market that's out there and like I said

983
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,990
there's the attack service that you've

984
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,220
got of when we think about risk and this

985
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,740
is what I'd encourage people to think

986
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,910
about we too often focus on the website

987
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,860
you know what can we do around our

988
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,600
website and then we've got a mobile app

989
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,610
or a third-party built in mobile app

990
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,049
that talks to an API of ours and we

991
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,360
forget that suddenly we can't put our

992
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:46,580
own you know user behavioural SDK on

993
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,110
there or something else complicated and

994
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,850
then we have an API that some other

995
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,678
service talks to or then we have some

996
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,870
business partners or third parties who

997
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,220
talk to our API so suddenly you know

998
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,299
you've got a loyalty points key

999
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,890
applies out to lots of different

1000
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:59,330
businesses they're all subscribing to

1001
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,770
the same thing you're kind of the

1002
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,000
central point but

1003
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,860
one of those can be used to control

1004
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,110
stuff against you what are they doing to

1005
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,540
protect the data that you're supposed to

1006
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,649
be keeping you know that don't need to

1007
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,700
tell you this but there's a phenomenal

1008
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:16,360
optic in a guy's usage out there so when

1009
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,620
we look at defenses blocking limiting

1010
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,178
this is what a lot of people think about

1011
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,669
doing they think about rate limiting or

1012
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:24,290
blocking but user agents the problem

1013
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,120
with this is most of the information

1014
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:28,520
that people rely on is client-side

1015
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,678
information as the user agent you know

1016
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,940
what capabilities it has it can be

1017
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:33,860
spoofed it can be faked

1018
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,929
if you rate limit I can distribute

1019
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,340
through a property network so I can

1020
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:39,679
start to slide onto your rate limiting

1021
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,480
if you want to but the capture captures

1022
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,820
are good in specific scenarios where

1023
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,010
you're protecting like a login or some

1024
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,360
piece of information like that but there

1025
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:50,000
are capture farms up there like to

1026
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,219
capture their fifty cents gets you a

1027
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,440
thousand capture solved by a real human

1028
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,910
being takes about twenty to thirty

1029
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,260
seconds for them to see you send the

1030
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,850
mountain image and they send you the

1031
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,620
text back in that you do tools this is

1032
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:03,639
built-in and automated so you're

1033
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:05,959
automatically cracking captures there

1034
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,550
you know there's the joke that someone's

1035
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,899
put up about congratulations you've got

1036
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,850
your page load time down to 100

1037
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:13,250
milliseconds that's 100 milliseconds and

1038
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:14,270
then you've sought to capture challenge

1039
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,730
on there or something like that which

1040
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:18,440
takes even 30 seconds to solve so it

1041
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,060
becomes a problem for you and then

1042
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,889
there's that the clever stuff the user

1043
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,109
behavior the javascript in the browser

1044
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:25,639
so it's checking your mouth trails it's

1045
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:27,049
checking whether it's a real browser is

1046
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,119
it a headless system all this kind of

1047
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,830
thing problem is again your home kind of

1048
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,510
haven't send that to an attacker they're

1049
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:34,100
processing it reverse engineering and

1050
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:36,379
spoofing the response back to you or

1051
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,029
they're doing a Mechanical Turk getting

1052
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:40,310
real people to move the mouse around you

1053
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,109
get a real user valid cookie set for the

1054
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:44,029
session and then they will just automate

1055
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:46,489
the rest so there's lots of ways around

1056
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,810
this and you know when we've worked with

1057
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,699
organizations one of the things that

1058
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,049
we've come up against is here we've done

1059
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:52,460
all these things and we're still seeing

1060
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,980
huge volumes of traffic that we don't

1061
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,810
understand well let's have a look at

1062
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,890
your system well we've got this list of

1063
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,560
stuff that we definitely want white

1064
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,970
listed so we white list is Googlebot you

1065
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,740
know we were advised to do this by this

1066
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,689
analytics package that said you know we

1067
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,910
wanted to maintain our search engine

1068
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:10,010
ranking they'll look all right down

1069
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,868
there yeah if you're looking at logs you

1070
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,320
can see that it's a valid user agents if

1071
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:15,540
you google those

1072
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,070
that is a valid Googlebot user agent if

1073
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,750
you do her who is look up on the

1074
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:21,480
organization's beyond those it's not

1075
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:23,910
Google so this was a particular website

1076
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,200
you're looking at recently and they had

1077
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,879
a huge amount of traffic coming from

1078
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,660
competitors who were all pretending to

1079
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,580
be Google BOTS

1080
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,740
because everything coming from Googlebot

1081
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,710
was a whitelisted they didn't one-stop

1082
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:38,029
google trolling their site said do it by

1083
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:38,030
user agent which can be spoofed

1084
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:43,230
verifying Googlebot if you don't have to

1085
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,420
do that you have to do a reverse DNS

1086
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:48,320
lookup and see whether that's actually

1087
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,790
coming from google.com or google.com

1088
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,380
because the really clever attackers will

1089
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,930
actually try and use Google data centers

1090
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,250
to send spoof things out so when you do

1091
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,230
that who is look up it says this is

1092
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,820
definitely still Google but it's not

1093
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,350
actually Googlebot it's something using

1094
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,840
a Googlebot user agent from the Google

1095
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,970
cloud data center to appear like

1096
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,650
Googlebot so it becomes very very

1097
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,970
strange very quickly and a lot of the

1098
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:10,740
tools we have in place when we're

1099
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,169
thinking about this in terms of IP is

1100
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,549
the user agent that's not a very good

1101
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,840
way for us to think about it when we're

1102
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:19,830
looking at business logic attacks like

1103
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,090
this nice example of someone who thought

1104
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,910
they'd stopped an attack from Russia

1105
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:25,920
they basically hit a rate limit and they

1106
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:28,109
started blocking these Russian data

1107
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,510
centers so this spike on the Left this

1108
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:32,100
big green one this was some datacenters

1109
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,930
in Russia this was a few different IPS

1110
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,130
and they basically hit a ceiling and

1111
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,359
they start blocking off this Russian

1112
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,670
datacenter and thought the attack was

1113
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,510
over but look what happened after they

1114
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,860
thought they bought the attack the

1115
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,450
attack has basically had worked out

1116
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,730
where the ceiling of their rate-limiting

1117
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,799
was from single eyed peas and then just

1118
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,440
distributed the attack from multiple

1119
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,910
Gio's all sliding behind an invisible

1120
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,220
line just to stay on to that

1121
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:55,040
rate-limiting so they were missing big

1122
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,480
chunk of attack because it suddenly went

1123
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,310
distributed on them how do they do

1124
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,750
tricks like this well one of the cool

1125
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,430
things that probably not a lot of people

1126
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:05,580
have come across is these residential

1127
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:07,740
proxy networks so this one here one our

1128
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,690
free tests whitelisted proxies they

1129
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,089
guarantee not to be on any threat

1130
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,520
intelligence reputation your feeds they

1131
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:17,190
guaranteed to be mobile operators

1132
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,870
domestic IPS for some mysterious reason

1133
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:22,260
that they are anonymous

1134
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:23,520
without usage logs wonder why I'm

1135
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,380
guaranteed to be a hundred percent white

1136
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,229
listed so you think what where are they

1137
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,969
gathering all these things problem

1138
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:33,538
well if we start to look at mobile app

1139
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:35,099
stores you can monetize apps you can

1140
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:35,969
stick adverts on them you can charge

1141
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:38,489
people do them

1142
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:40,469
we can add an SDK like monkey stocks

1143
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:42,749
note here which allows you to monetize

1144
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:44,789
your app by sharing a small amount of

1145
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:47,189
the users bandwidth when their battery

1146
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:49,289
is above 70% they are not using their

1147
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:52,680
device and they have a decent stable

1148
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:54,180
connection so you have to warner use it

1149
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,649
with a little bit in that long terms and

1150
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,749
conditions which we all read in great

1151
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:00,180
detail and put a little notice on the

1152
00:37:57,749 --> 00:38:01,558
Play Store but then suddenly your

1153
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,029
friends and relatives who downloaded a

1154
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:05,160
free app thinking this is a cool game

1155
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:06,989
this is or whatever a part of a botnet

1156
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,269
that allows an attacker to come out from

1157
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:10,890
their home might be so if the IP gets

1158
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:13,049
blocked that's going to be a problem

1159
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,400
because if you're trying to shop and you

1160
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:16,259
know attackers use not to attack the

1161
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,700
cyclotron a shop won how do you tell

1162
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:19,829
who's good and who's bad it becomes

1163
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,859
really tricky and then we come across

1164
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:23,519
over VPN before peer-to-peer free VPN

1165
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:26,369
service

1166
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:28,410
I think they claimed 191 million people

1167
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:30,599
worldwide and there's an interesting

1168
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:32,249
case with with all the VPN obviously

1169
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,460
people I think well what's good to know

1170
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:37,680
the VP only gonna get one exit at a time

1171
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:40,289
but it's free for a reason they have a

1172
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,489
sister company called Illuminati who

1173
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:47,099
then use those and sell those for

1174
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:49,380
legitimate legal scraping services so

1175
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:50,849
you can choose a city you can choose a

1176
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,769
mobile network you can choose a great

1177
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:55,140
level of detail and you can use that as

1178
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:56,308
your proxy network so suddenly the

1179
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,499
things stuck in your website aren't

1180
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:59,940
coming from some evil Russian datacenter

1181
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:01,410
or if you've ever dealt with this before

1182
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,420
things like digitalocean and common

1183
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:05,219
offenders you've got residential

1184
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,309
domestic connections mobile networks

1185
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:10,499
that people can use it becomes very hard

1186
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:12,329
to stop those attacks again I must

1187
00:39:10,499 --> 00:39:13,439
stress in Illuminati do say the terms

1188
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:15,299
and conditions it's for legal purposes

1189
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,890
for scraping for competitive

1190
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:18,180
intelligence things like that so you

1191
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,739
know I'm not saying that they're doing

1192
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,960
bad things but it's interesting that

1193
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:25,049
these networks exist and people often

1194
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,670
aren't aware of them the JavaScript so

1195
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:28,170
again this is someone said oh we've got

1196
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:30,239
this behavioral fingerprinting but we're

1197
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:32,219
still seeing BOTS came through and

1198
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:35,670
that's a mob obfuscated java code on

1199
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:36,719
their system but it's kind of trivial to

1200
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,950
start putting that into something and

1201
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:39,140
reverse engineering it so we start

1202
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,299
looking at the code

1203
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:43,670
going okay it's checking whether I have

1204
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,100
real fonts available what fonts do I

1205
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:48,080
have available is this a real browser is

1206
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,549
this real user of course once you've

1207
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,100
worked out what the tells are you spoof

1208
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:53,630
those and send a response back or you

1209
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:58,370
actually just automate with a real

1210
00:39:53,630 --> 00:40:00,740
browser so this is another one Mike you

1211
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,120
can't generate at all so this is part of

1212
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,640
the sneak about things for generating

1213
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,080
accounts and you look in the description

1214
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,020
of it they're talking about the ways

1215
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,000
that they're using to bypass different

1216
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,770
systems so they're doing things like

1217
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,770
they've discovered by changing the TLS

1218
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:17,420
version to 1.1 it bypasses the thing

1219
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,040
that was blocking them before and

1220
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,150
they'll reverse engineer things and

1221
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,650
they'll do all sorts of different bits

1222
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:24,470
and pieces if you actually look at the

1223
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:26,600
changelog they had a takedown request in

1224
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:28,549
this case from Akamai on the grounds of

1225
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,080
they reverse-engineer the JavaScript so

1226
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:32,000
they could see in the source code so it

1227
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,020
wasn't another technical thing it was

1228
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,060
done on the fact that they didn't

1229
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,800
fringed Akamai's copyright by reverse

1230
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,270
engineering this JavaScript that

1231
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,460
validated whether you're a real user or

1232
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,870
not and they put that in their tool so

1233
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,560
you can see Akamai's script in their

1234
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,259
source code

1235
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,970
you know this is all online available

1236
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,230
for people to see and it's not just

1237
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:50,149
Akamai of course you know things like

1238
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:53,090
CloudFlare there's a library here and

1239
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:54,440
there's a few scraping services out

1240
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,120
there that recommend you use this if

1241
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,740
you're going after site protected by

1242
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,500
clover and they do various different

1243
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,229
techniques to bypass clouds flares

1244
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,580
anti-bot pages so it's this constant cat

1245
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,500
and mouse game every time someone brings

1246
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,330
up a new thing - new way to detect

1247
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,740
whether it's a bot or a human these

1248
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:13,069
people constantly looking to

1249
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,750
reverse-engineer it I'll just wrap up

1250
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,640
with a couple of other examples that are

1251
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,110
interesting so when people think about

1252
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,089
these kind of account taker from these

1253
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:23,030
kind of attacks that are out there they

1254
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:25,220
often think about just the web blogs and

1255
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,570
what's going on there but actually the

1256
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,029
synergy can pull in your back-end

1257
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,680
systems your account systems this was an

1258
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,870
interesting one where website had been

1259
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,390
blind to the system where if you had

1260
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:37,279
five invalid login attempts they booted

1261
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:39,350
you for five minutes based on your IP

1262
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,390
another five the booted here for 24

1263
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,650
hours and then they found the attackers

1264
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,720
you know brief for a brief period of

1265
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,040
time kind of backing off but then they

1266
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,899
came back and they were try and work out

1267
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,000
what was going on and then they looked

1268
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,380
at the number of new accounts being

1269
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,369
created because it's free to create a

1270
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,440
new account

1271
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:55,999
and what the fakirs had done is you can

1272
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,109
almost work out what time zone they're

1273
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:58,519
in by the hours that they're doing this

1274
00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:00,499
but they're running scripts to create

1275
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:01,999
new accounts so they were try and

1276
00:42:00,499 --> 00:42:03,288
credential stuff for different

1277
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:05,328
combinations of username and password

1278
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:07,219
and then use one that they've created so

1279
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:08,269
they know it's valid that gets you past

1280
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:10,849
the hurdle so you're not going to be

1281
00:42:08,269 --> 00:42:12,348
blocked another for one that you know is

1282
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:13,460
valid so you're never going to hit that

1283
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:15,650
five limit because you're always

1284
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,839
sticking in every fifth one a valid user

1285
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,309
account so again this is exploiting

1286
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,049
business object this isn't some clever

1287
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:22,880
remote code exploit thing this isn't

1288
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:25,069
some unpatched vulnerable system this is

1289
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,900
you've got a business logic process that

1290
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:29,989
goes like this and they've worked around

1291
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:32,210
it another one to you can look for tells

1292
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:33,829
from unusual geo locations and things as

1293
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,259
well this was kind of an interesting one

1294
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:37,779
this is a quite a large carding attack

1295
00:42:36,259 --> 00:42:41,539
so they were testing stolen card details

1296
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:43,400
the big light blue line is the American

1297
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:45,469
data centers the attack was being

1298
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,499
launched out of what was interesting was

1299
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:50,420
this one was this particular attacker we

1300
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,919
got to kind of know quite well because

1301
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,009
they always used their home connection

1302
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,420
in Turkey to test the attack and you can

1303
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:58,400
see the little spots here so at the top

1304
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,380
they're doing they're sort of basically

1305
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,989
working out the configuration for their

1306
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:05,089
attack what they need to do the valid

1307
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:06,680
login page that what the card successful

1308
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:09,049
login page look like what the card

1309
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,700
failed login page looks like configuring

1310
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:12,170
it the static going from the large

1311
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,939
American data center and every so often

1312
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,680
you can see the little blip when they

1313
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,819
log in to check whether you know on

1314
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,379
there and that the configuration is

1315
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:20,538
still valid that is still they need to

1316
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:22,069
tweak anything but again there's little

1317
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:23,960
things like that we can start to build a

1318
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:25,339
picture of certain attackers and look

1319
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,469
for other signals in there so it's not

1320
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:29,239
always about looking at the big body of

1321
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:31,430
traffic is did we have a sudden spike in

1322
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:33,769
an unusual geo was there something else

1323
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,910
that we've never seen before appear and

1324
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:36,078
this is why they're coming I work for

1325
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:37,819
tends to use a lot of machine learning

1326
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,039
techniques because you can start to

1327
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:41,619
tease out some of these patterns

1328
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:45,130
relatively easily

1329
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:46,489
so it's still a right for time cool so

1330
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:48,140
summary at the end

1331
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:49,789
bots require a bit of a different

1332
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,219
mindset we often think of security in

1333
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:53,989
terms of remote code execution have way

1334
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:55,880
perhaps this have we got these ports

1335
00:43:53,989 --> 00:43:57,710
open you know are we vulnerable to

1336
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,210
sequel injection or actually with these

1337
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,710
kind of attacks they require a bit of a

1338
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,690
different mindset that you need to be

1339
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,579
thinking in terms of your business logic

1340
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,839
processes and actually working at your

1341
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:07,519
risk you know I've talked about some

1342
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,890
quite scary tactical a lot of these are

1343
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,868
against retailers or things with high

1344
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,400
values behind the multi-point scheme

1345
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:15,759
streaming services things like that so

1346
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,109
if your company has a web app or service

1347
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:20,269
think about you know you might not be as

1348
00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:21,769
at risk you might be might be perfectly

1349
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:23,328
level for you to do some great limit ins

1350
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:25,549
and capturing some filtering of user

1351
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:26,930
agents but just be aware of if you

1352
00:44:25,549 --> 00:44:28,219
suddenly have some other value there

1353
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,129
that the attacker might want to get to

1354
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:33,109
that might evolve very quickly and

1355
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:34,369
building defenses in fear is actually

1356
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:36,619
better so you see some of the things

1357
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:39,229
that people fighting Zika parts are

1358
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:40,700
doing it's actually better to make an

1359
00:44:39,229 --> 00:44:43,308
attacker think they've logged in

1360
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:44,479
successfully when they haven't because

1361
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:47,269
the problem is if you start playing

1362
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:50,598
block by IP or user agent with these

1363
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:52,160
guys or girls then you end up in a game

1364
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:53,569
whack-a-mole and what you can end up is

1365
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,910
almost ddossing yourself because they

1366
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:57,769
can just keep scaling whereas if you

1367
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,509
feed them false information if you read

1368
00:44:57,769 --> 00:45:01,669
that written to a page with some junk

1369
00:44:59,509 --> 00:45:03,890
information if you build it in like a

1370
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:06,049
honeypot system if you automatically

1371
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:07,279
just trigger a password reset if you

1372
00:45:06,049 --> 00:45:09,979
think an account is being compromised

1373
00:45:07,279 --> 00:45:11,239
then the attacker is in trouble because

1374
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:12,859
when they try and resell that account

1375
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:14,119
it's their reputation it's damaged and

1376
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:15,769
they'll just go after someone else

1377
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:17,749
there's plenty for the low-hanging fruit

1378
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:19,758
out there for them so it's not always

1379
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:21,348
about just playing block at the IP level

1380
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,940
block at the user-agent level block at

1381
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:24,880
the date since level something about

1382
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:28,039
building these processes into your

1383
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,930
account management systems client

1384
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:31,969
signals can and will always be spoofed

1385
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:33,078
so you can't rely on that they too can

1386
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:35,779
be useful for the less sophisticated

1387
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:37,009
facts you wouldn't believe a number of

1388
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:39,440
things where you look at the user agent

1389
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:41,119
and it just says pison requests you know

1390
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,529
that's probably not a real user with a

1391
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,869
real browser is it you know that kind of

1392
00:45:42,529 --> 00:45:47,239
level of detail and the other thing is

1393
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:49,460
often these risks fall between the

1394
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:51,109
cracks and organizations the marketing

1395
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,180
team seems that their marketing budget

1396
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:55,160
they have spent on that new email blast

1397
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:57,200
that's gone out you know to launch this

1398
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,910
new product isn't doing quite the things

1399
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,038
they want their analytics assumed that

1400
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,660
the ops team a complainer that the you

1401
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,700
know you've got all these hosting costs

1402
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,538
that you having to scale up all the time

1403
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,308
there's all these different things

1404
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:09,109
security missing accounts being breached

1405
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:10,849
a fraud team somewhere and complaining

1406
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:13,519
the customers accounts have been hacked

1407
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:15,559
it can spread across an organization and

1408
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,479
there's no one clear defined owner and

1409
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:19,310
actually stopping automated threats is a

1410
00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:21,020
benefit to the whole business so

1411
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,220
if you look at the things by forest or

1412
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,420
other people recently it's really

1413
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:25,399
important to start thinking about who

1414
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:27,440
owns this problem in your organization

1415
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,030
and doing that threat modeling if you

1416
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,550
haven't ever had a look at it a wasp

1417
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:33,320
through automated through a humbug have

1418
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:34,510
some really good starts as and how you

1419
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,160
can start to look at these threats

1420
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,950
validate whether you have them build a

1421
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:42,410
minty design process so that's you know

1422
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:47,020
really worth a look other than that

1423
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:47,020
that's everything from me thank him

1424
00:46:53,710 --> 00:47:34,550
first time it has anyone got any

1425
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:36,140
questions yes yes so yeah so the trick

1426
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:37,550
is a lot so that the question is can you

1427
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:39,319
do it if you would like encryption or

1428
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:41,240
something like that to make them receive

1429
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,650
a nice mathematical puzzle effective

1430
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,899
rhythms are solves that you could yeah

1431
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:45,890
so some vendors do do that and we

1432
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,710
actually do something like that

1433
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:50,000
our company occasionally he do like a

1434
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:52,760
proof-of-work to check whether they have

1435
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,200
valid JavaScript get it to you know do a

1436
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,120
calculation and come up with a number

1437
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,980
and again it's part of that technique of

1438
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,529
not blocking the attacker necessary but

1439
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:02,360
consuming their resources the problem is

1440
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:04,880
you tend to consume real users resources

1441
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,860
as well a little bit and attackers if

1442
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,900
they're determined enough can just run

1443
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,730
those things and do them but yes it's

1444
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,590
not a bad deterrence and sort of privily

1445
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:15,230
you filter up the low-level stuff the

1446
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:16,130
headless stuff the car in JavaScript the

1447
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:19,400
things that can just do some basic

1448
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:20,690
simulation so you can do that if you

1449
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,490
look at some of the techniques that

1450
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:24,350
people have also used is people will

1451
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:26,089
look at the site for suites that are

1452
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:28,160
presented and see if they match up the

1453
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:30,170
user agent things like that so just why

1454
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,540
you mention encryption that you can do

1455
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:34,220
things like that some of the bigger CDN

1456
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,210
vendors often do that so when you do

1457
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,310
that initial handshake

1458
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,830
does this details match up you know this

1459
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:41,450
user saying that they're on internet or

1460
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,290
above they're on an iPhone and things

1461
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:43,549
like that we come across that

1462
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:46,759
occasionally where people really don't

1463
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:48,350
understand user agent strings so yeah

1464
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,850
you can do things that it's generally

1465
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:51,410
about what you can do to consume them in

1466
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:53,279
fact as resources and kind of make them

1467
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:56,100
go away a little bit

1468
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,260
yeah so that is polishing see how

1469
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:02,190
question when we're talking about the

1470
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:05,100
Lansky came back together I appreciate

1471
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:08,850
that it's a bit of an amateur yes since

1472
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:11,040
Aziz as he cryptocurrencies most of the

1473
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:13,980
time was the answer

1474
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:18,060
it's a mix yes gift cards loyalty points

1475
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:19,410
that depends on who's doing it there's

1476
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,840
also a different weird and wonderful

1477
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:24,120
payment schemes that they take even see

1478
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,640
some that basically like will do this

1479
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,470
for you and take a bits like a

1480
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,330
percentage thing with the sneaker box

1481
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,830
especially that they'll operate

1482
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,840
everything for you to do is a managed

1483
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:35,430
service effectively you get the sneakers

1484
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,870
but he pay them Thomson Commission and

1485
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:39,629
that's real money and all that kind of

1486
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:41,670
thing and yeah just seem to be in the

1487
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:43,860
past year or so a transition what it's

1488
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:45,030
like royalty point schemes and gift

1489
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,560
vouchers and things like that they can

1490
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:49,080
store and they hold that the more stable

1491
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,100
your crypto currencies a little bit you

1492
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,900
know there's there's some really weird

1493
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,940
wonderful things out there and you do

1494
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,130
see actually if you start getting into

1495
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:58,890
the gaming sector and gambling people

1496
00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:00,060
trying to do things with our betting if

1497
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:02,279
you're interested have a look at net to

1498
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,049
see our websites and bloggers on our

1499
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,090
betting one of our data scientist it and

1500
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,380
people will use this to basically try

1501
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:09,900
and launder money make it look like

1502
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,310
gambling winnings because they're trying

1503
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,200
to place bets they know they can win or

1504
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:14,670
this bookies has a free bet of this much

1505
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,890
and how can I offset that so I can't

1506
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:18,240
lose and all sorts of weird and

1507
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:21,330
wonderful things like that want people

1508
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:32,490
doing strange stuff to generate revenue

1509
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:35,220
or hide illegal games yeah multi-factor

1510
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:37,950
authentication just slow down there have

1511
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:40,259
been a few highly sophisticated attacks

1512
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:42,660
where people have used things to try and

1513
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,310
crack phone systems to get codes and

1514
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:46,589
also to win one for supply it's very

1515
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:49,890
very rare the problem main problem is

1516
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:51,870
that security is this security usability

1517
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:53,609
thing you know I'm sure people are sick

1518
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:55,049
of talking about but it'd be great if

1519
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:56,630
everyone could just jump on board and

1520
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:59,700
we'll do it multi-factor authentication

1521
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:01,980
but in the world of like retail and

1522
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,540
gaming and things are you don't want to

1523
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,270
make users think before they buy the

1524
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:07,060
expensive

1525
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:08,350
they probably don't need so it's very

1526
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:18,640
hard to implement on some of those

1527
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:20,230
systems yeah yeah yeah yeah but the

1528
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,730
thing I always come back to is what

1529
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:24,130
would my parents do if I presented them

1530
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:26,710
is one of those and I know it would be

1531
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:29,020
sell under a coffee cup somewhere so

1532
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:31,690
there is a there is change I agree that

1533
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:33,460
is getting better it's not as bad as he

1534
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:35,320
used to be they're a lot less intrusive

1535
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,360
ways to do these you know the biometrics

1536
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:39,370
you know you can authorize payments with

1537
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,900
a fingerprint and you know these are the

1538
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:42,490
wonderful things you trying to build

1539
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,470
fingerprint reads into cards and stuff

1540
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:46,149
like that but it's going to be a

1541
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:48,490
longtail problem there's always going to

1542
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:50,770
be people for the kind of thing so yeah

1543
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:52,750
I'd love to see more of that and then it

1544
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:56,020
becomes the challenge of sometimes with

1545
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:57,910
you know if it's a API and it said

1546
00:51:56,020 --> 00:52:00,070
mobile operates a third-party mobile app

1547
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:02,440
where does the boundary layer is

1548
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:04,690
responsible for that and it becomes a

1549
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,050
little more convoluted sometimes with

1550
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:09,790
those supply chain issues but yeah

1551
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:12,010
multi-factor authentication actually

1552
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:14,950
kills a lot of them for their account

1553
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:17,650
takeover for the scraping and you know

1554
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:19,750
other things inventory holding again it

1555
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:24,460
is specific solves a specific account

1556
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:26,350
based problem yeah okay I'm being given

1557
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:27,340
time here so we'll wrap up but I'll be

1558
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,990
sticking around for a little bit if

1559
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:32,100
anyone's got any more questions thank

1560
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:32,100
you very much for coming to see me
