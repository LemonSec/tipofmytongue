1
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:08,469
and so my background in cybersecurity is

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,379
predominantly in application security so

3
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:13,748
I have had just under four years of

4
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:16,630
experience with dynamic application

5
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:18,550
security and where I spend a lot of time

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,460
learning about vulnerabilities and web

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,830
applications identify them on also

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,640
teaching people how to identify those

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:30,038
same vulnerabilities more recently I

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,110
have moved into the static application

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,300
security side of things where I see a

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,760
lot more in terms of code and

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,038
applications determining if a fix is

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:43,930
actually truly effects for a particular

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:46,510
vulnerability suppose fun facts about me

16
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,699
and I'm kind of a runner and over the

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,379
summer here the last four or five months

18
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:52,870
I've been just fitting in running Don

19
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:56,230
dimension I on Sunday just there and

20
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:59,589
finished running 300 kilometers and

21
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:03,669
raised about a 440 point for Alzheimer's

22
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:06,430
research okay I am also a very big Harry

23
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,380
Potter fan and as you can see from the

24
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,259
picture there of me this was taking up

25
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,869
my hem party where instead of a

26
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:16,329
traditional bride-to-be sash my maid of

27
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:18,790
honor bought me a witch's hat that had

28
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:20,649
written on it right to be I then

29
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,049
actually went on with my husband to have

30
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,610
a Harry Potter themed wedding and if

31
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,140
anyone is interested in seeing any of

32
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,680
those pictures you can follow me on

33
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,840
Twitter and where I have shared some of

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,390
these pictures yes my twitter handle is

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,600
awesome socks I was on 17 when I made it

36
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,399
and thought I was really cool there we

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,798
are and I'm not that active on Twitter

38
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,320
but please feel free to follow me and I

39
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,030
sometime shared some cool things and I

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,000
definitely read a lot of conversations

41
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,880
on there so with that background up like

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,259
me you're probably wondering why are you

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,119
going to be talking about tracking hits

44
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:57,490
online it's not my job it's not what I

45
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,509
actually do for a living I'm not really

46
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:04,329
not involved in it in itself as a real

47
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:09,160
activity of doing that kind of research

48
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:11,120
and so these two are my primary reason

49
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,609
for being interested in

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,430
but this is my niece and nephew so my

51
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:19,730
sister-in-law's kids and my niece is 13

52
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,709
my nephew is 3 so I've been a part of

53
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,738
their lives for the entirety of my

54
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:27,019
nephew's life and five years of my

55
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:28,849
niece's so I've spent a lot of time

56
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:30,950
living at what they're doing with

57
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:34,369
technology how they're getting involved

58
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,420
in all the different areas of the

59
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,920
Internet

60
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:42,429
for example my niece is has got a

61
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,230
smartphone is on a lot of different apps

62
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,519
constantly asking for whatever is

63
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,260
popular at the time

64
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:51,260
so that she can communicate with her

65
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,220
friends so as you can see they are

66
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,870
little enlarged they have two different

67
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,840
areas of life and they're both

68
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,329
experiencing two different ways in which

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,329
they're it's boost to the Internet and

70
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:08,450
so my top is split into two different

71
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:09,980
parts we've got the baby to child to

72
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,839
each range because they're very

73
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,578
different in the way they are exposed to

74
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,100
the internet on what they actually do

75
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:19,160
online and then we have the what I'm

76
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,680
tween two young adult so the more

77
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,230
interactive the things that a young

78
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,680
person wants to get involved in on the

79
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:32,540
Internet so we will start with the

80
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,940
younger younger side of things the first

81
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,298
thing we're going to talk about is

82
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:40,819
muttering devices from the moment a

83
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,919
child is born nor we have all of these

84
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,888
technologies that we want to be able to

85
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:47,269
manage those children on make sure that

86
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:48,739
they're safe make sure that they're

87
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,680
healthy make sure they're sleeping well

88
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:54,470
and a lot of these devices are getting

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,480
more and more connected so we're seeing

90
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,540
a lot more baby monitors that are

91
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,798
connected to apps on your phone which a

92
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,608
lot of them know you're coming with

93
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,349
cameras on speakers as well as and the

94
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:08,510
traditional listening to the child while

95
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:11,298
they sleep but also some of them are

96
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,370
coming by with a wave in which that you

97
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:16,789
can also talk to you ever is in that

98
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,620
room at the same time and if we think

99
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:21,849
about that from an attackers perspective

100
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,800
if they are able to access that device

101
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,260
they're then able to not only see your

102
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,360
child in their room they're also able to

103
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:32,400
potentially communicate with whoever is

104
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,570
in that room and some of the real

105
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,880
potentials for that are going to be

106
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,360
things like if you have a routine for

107
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,130
putting your child to bed as an example

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,890
generally speaking this may be more for

109
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,719
a more high-profile person who has a

110
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,630
huge house where there's multiple

111
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,340
different entries to that house think

112
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,870
about the fact that you maybe put your

113
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,520
child to bed at the same time every

114
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,500
night there's a big gap between the

115
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,570
times booing and you actually go under

116
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,840
check on the child rather than using

117
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:04,900
this IOT device and that over a period

118
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,929
of time say an attacker is able to watch

119
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,390
what you do with your routine for your

120
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,370
child and they're then able to pinpoint

121
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,020
the exact moment that would be perfect

122
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,060
to go on so they kidnap that child

123
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,430
and these are some of the things that

124
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,080
maybe aren't saw to bite when developers

125
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,810
are creating these technologies because

126
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,690
security as we all are aware it's not at

127
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,430
the forefront of everyone's minds most

128
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,900
people probably in this room do you

129
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,510
really think about security when they

130
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,340
going to do something but for a lot of

131
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,260
these devices especially cheap ones

132
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:41,020
they're designed to function I'm not

133
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:43,030
necessarily be secure if you were at the

134
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,849
talk earlier today about hacking RF you

135
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,200
will have learnt a little bit about the

136
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:51,130
wireless communications and why they are

137
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,710
vulnerable anything sent over the over

138
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,110
the internet and over any wireless

139
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:59,020
communication is potential for being

140
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,630
vulnerable and so just because something

141
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,909
may be said to be secure in any way does

142
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:06,550
not make it so on a lot of these IOT

143
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,650
devices you use a number of the same

144
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,440
frameworks and the same technologies

145
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:14,140
that if one of them is vulnerable most

146
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,100
likely a large majority of the rest also

147
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,390
will be some of the other types of IOT

148
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,050
devices are going to be monitoring

149
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:24,370
health and for most kids that's probably

150
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:28,110
not really necessary

151
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:30,520
so things like the little soft on the

152
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,880
left-hand side right there

153
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,799
piece of my monitoring heart rate and

154
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,280
and but option levels and things like

155
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,740
that

156
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,229
the for a child that may have health

157
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,599
issues it's something that may be a

158
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:45,340
benefit to them but for the vast

159
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:48,159
majority of kids that's not really

160
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:51,190
something that is necessary and also is

161
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,639
something that should be a detriment to

162
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:57,520
them and actually the family in which

163
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,949
that they are living so take as an

164
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,900
example if someone was able to interfere

165
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:04,060
with that data going into that device

166
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,250
let's say it's sent to your back-end and

167
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,409
sent back to the app so that it can be

168
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,720
looked at from anywhere so now it's just

169
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:12,340
stored locally if someone was able to

170
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,590
make it look like your child was

171
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,940
severely ill yes you might be looking at

172
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,969
them going now they're not really ill

173
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:22,330
but as a maybe panicked first-time

174
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:26,080
parent who trusts these devices so sue

175
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,940
them so much you might think oh well you

176
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,639
know what I believe that this may be

177
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,800
true I'm gonna rush to A&E and go on to

178
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,000
make sure that my kid is okay as you're

179
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,949
rushing out of the house in the middle

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,180
of the night someone might be sitting

181
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:39,610
around the corner waiting for you to

182
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:42,370
leave your property and maybe go in and

183
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,490
start nipping things or maybe being that

184
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:48,219
helpful bystander he would then maybe

185
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,409
help you close your door on their way

186
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:53,919
out and actually just won't entry to

187
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:56,080
your home so in the grand scheme of

188
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,448
things with IOT devices they are not

189
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,930
necessarily all that secure and aren't

190
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:04,300
really marketed that way and I also

191
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,219
recently find that most of these devices

192
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,949
especially the medical side of things

193
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:11,080
are not approved by anyone to ensure

194
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:13,750
that they are actually effective or work

195
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,370
in any way and Unsoeld they are just

196
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,889
sort of a see if you'd like it which

197
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:21,909
might actually cause more fear rather

198
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:27,280
than actually help ensue with that and

199
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:29,169
we have one other I am device that while

200
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,568
I was looking for examples of this I

201
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:34,419
really kind of had to think why do we

202
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:37,979
need this so the main purpose for this

203
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:41,260
device is to track your child

204
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:44,320
toilet habits mostly for every time they

205
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,540
have a wet not be you then get this

206
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,500
track done get a schedule for your child

207
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:53,230
so in reality is this really just

208
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,390
finding solutions for problems that

209
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,920
don't actually exist because you're

210
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,949
going to have change so many of these

211
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,969
that do you really need to know how many

212
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:04,560
you've actually changed in a lifetime

213
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,560
like is that really necessary

214
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,670
this is probably not all that secure in

215
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,089
terms of the data that's being entered

216
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,829
and how it's being stored and this does

217
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:17,860
also actually come with some of those

218
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:20,739
other potential issues in terms of this

219
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,200
is a whole system where you get these

220
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:27,370
very expensive nabis that have a little

221
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,740
place for the device to fit on but also

222
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,690
comes with a camera which would be the

223
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,050
same sort of thing of those IOT devices

224
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,490
that are potentially vulnerable so

225
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,949
really you want to spend a lot of money

226
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,410
on already expensive nabis to learn

227
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:46,510
their bite why often your child he's

228
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:49,000
basically moving on from there we have

229
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:53,350
connected toys so moving on to the age

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,970
of kids who are now playing with toys

231
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,970
that are connected to the Internet in

232
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,200
some way or connected through bluetooth

233
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,140
so they can have a more interactive

234
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,339
experience and this particular toy and

235
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:08,350
my friend Kayla is one that it takes the

236
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:11,589
recordings of your child speaking to it

237
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:15,310
at the end response so generically these

238
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:17,440
are these are generic responses that it

239
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,760
provides and so it's not exactly like

240
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,699
there's a person on the other end is

241
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,089
feeding back to the child but if there

242
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:27,640
was a way for an attacker to get those

243
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:31,630
responses to be their own that could be

244
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,980
a case for actual interaction and we'll

245
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,320
get onto another example in just a

246
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,709
second that that is actually a very real

247
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,410
possibility but this particular toy was

248
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:42,300
actually bombed in Germany because it

249
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,750
was considered

250
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,729
device so this particular toy is no

251
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,460
longer allowed to be owned in Germany

252
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,770
because it is basically surveillance so

253
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,690
if you think about a young child who's

254
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,100
learning how to spell their name

255
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,050
learning what street they live on

256
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,320
learning a phone number so that if they

257
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,760
ever need help they know who to call

258
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,590
they don't necessarily realize they

259
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,810
shouldn't be telling their inanimate

260
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,880
object toy of a best friend that they

261
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:12,930
live on one two three four high street

262
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,410
right and so that information is going

263
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,780
somewhere

264
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,699
and so whoever has access to that

265
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,069
information might find out a lot about

266
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,910
that particular child and that

267
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:26,340
particular family putting them at risk

268
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:28,709
so the other toy that I mentioned is

269
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,200
called cloud pets and this is actually

270
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:34,110
one I only saw yesterday and I thought

271
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,620
it was kind of terrifying it is a teddy

272
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,930
bear that your child can speak to it can

273
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,630
record something where it is Bluetooth

274
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:45,180
connected to a phone so the app on your

275
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,610
phone takes that recording from from the

276
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,520
teddy bear says it to a family member

277
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,010
who also has that app on their phone it

278
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,620
then plays that recording to the person

279
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:58,500
on the other end the scary part is that

280
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:01,380
someone anyone with that up you're

281
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,110
connected with three that up can then

282
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,330
record their own voice recording send

283
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,730
our cording back to the bear on the bear

284
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,290
plays a voice recording on this little

285
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:13,260
heart that tells you you've got a voice

286
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:16,050
message it's basically someone should be

287
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,530
Congress having a conversation with your

288
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,420
child

289
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:21,660
depending on the age range of course

290
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:28,229
depends on what's actually said or what

291
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:31,199
potential dangers that can be so moving

292
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:34,650
on that core can be deemed kids if apps

293
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,040
and one of the key things that I've seen

294
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,540
from my nephew who again he's three he

295
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,449
watches YouTube he watches lots of

296
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,610
trends on YouTube and when we're at

297
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,340
dinner you know the sit with a phone and

298
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,170
he'll have YouTube on and he'll slide to

299
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,360
choose the next video that he wants to

300
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,160
watch and as a three-year-old that's

301
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,199
kind of scary that they have that much

302
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,969
ability to use all of these technologies

303
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,939
but when it comes to can see if apps

304
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,040
trick kids is branded eyes this is

305
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,100
something that has lots of block doing

306
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,889
videos things that are meant to be seen

307
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,660
for kids but actually they're tracking

308
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:16,060
conditions are that it will only be

309
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,040
taken out of there if it is reported so

310
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,518
yes there is management it will be more

311
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:25,089
controlled than actual YouTube but it's

312
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:28,269
still inherently a place that videos can

313
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:30,220
be uploaded by regular users on if it

314
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:31,930
meets it into YouTube kids and it's

315
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,319
actually an appropriate it still needs

316
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,819
to be validated on and reported as

317
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:37,509
something that a kid should not be

318
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:40,240
watching

319
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:42,759
I mentioned disney life here just

320
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,939
because it is one of those it's more

321
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:48,759
likely to be see if in terms of if it's

322
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:50,110
you're just learning more videos because

323
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:52,089
it's going to be things that are on TV

324
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,459
it's highly regulated

325
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:57,100
whereas with YouTube YouTube is a free

326
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:59,619
bottle you can in theory put whatever

327
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,630
you want on to YouTube and assuming no

328
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,060
one reports it it could stay out for a

329
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:08,740
very long time depending on the content

330
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:11,829
and with that we're getting into more of

331
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:15,009
the social media aspect of how kids are

332
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:18,060
being exposed to the Internet and this

333
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:20,680
takes me onto the whole industry of

334
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,800
youtubers bloggers social media

335
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,229
influencers people who basically share

336
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,569
their lives online and this comes from

337
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:31,720
two different sides and on this

338
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:34,899
particular em side we're going to focus

339
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,790
more on the families that are sharing

340
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:39,490
this content or the people that are

341
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:42,459
sharing the content on the Internet so

342
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:46,860
we have a number of family vloggers on

343
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:49,059
this slide and with that comes from

344
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,980
people want to share their life right

345
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:53,170
they want to show that there are regular

346
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,120
people that they do fun things maybe it

347
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,128
starts as one of their family members is

348
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,629
in another country and they want to make

349
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:03,939
sure they're involved in each other's

350
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:05,709
lives but that comes down to one are the

351
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:07,469
parents in control of the content

352
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,689
actually being hit on to

353
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,250
on a lot of the family vloggers they are

354
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,200
it's the parent that's doing most of the

355
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,480
editing and putting things together so

356
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,960
they know what's actually going to end

357
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:22,470
up on the internet but when it comes to

358
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,480
those younger social influencers she's

359
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:28,230
cop you have come up either three a

360
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,660
family vlog or three TV in terms of

361
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:34,560
reality TV or just because they're any

362
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,959
kids programs they have a lot more

363
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,760
freedom generally because it's their

364
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,550
content it's the things they want to

365
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,370
share and so unless their parents are

366
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,290
particularly strict and a particularly

367
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,330
particularly aware of what their kids

368
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,120
are doing in the internet they can be

369
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,800
over sharing a lot they can be providing

370
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,920
details that they really shouldn't on

371
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,140
the internet until that becomes a big

372
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,469
scandal or tells their parent actually

373
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,390
watches those videos it can't become

374
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:06,030
that they have shared too much and

375
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:10,890
becomes really bad for that particular

376
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:13,560
child and we are aware parents are not

377
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:16,319
always the best people to advise when it

378
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,380
comes to the internet we have an example

379
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,580
of a family vlogger who kept taking

380
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,890
their kids to school they've loved

381
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,050
taking their kid to school they've loves

382
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,330
the area that they lived in to the point

383
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,120
where someone one of their followers

384
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:33,330
find out exactly where they lived and

385
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,400
started delivering Domino's pizzas to

386
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,260
their house to the point that they

387
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,449
called the place they had to get someone

388
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,330
else involved because someone knew where

389
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,230
they lived and we're basically just

390
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,240
abusing the fact that they knew where

391
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:49,110
they lived and that could have been a

392
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:52,500
very very severe more dangerous and to

393
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:55,170
the this family has had to use home to

394
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,850
get this to stop and they are still

395
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,280
loving they are still loving their home

396
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:02,040
and they are still sharing this

397
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,619
information with the world and to me

398
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,510
that's very scary it's one thing to vlog

399
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,250
in your house to share content of what

400
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,319
you're doing day to day but if you're

401
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,319
giving out that private information a

402
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:16,889
regular person who just lives on a

403
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:18,250
regular street who has ever maybe their

404
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,470
whole life is a huge

405
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,720
they don't necessarily have like the

406
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,390
same contacts that a celebrity and

407
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,240
traditional celebrity might have they

408
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:31,840
have the not only the funds but the

409
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,600
contacts to have personal security to

410
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:39,070
know people who can protect them from

411
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,110
these sorts of issues and so as a

412
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,909
regular person when you're on YouTube

413
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,580
and you want to be seen as a regular

414
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:50,500
person but just sharing your life it

415
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:53,740
becomes a lot more dangerous recently a

416
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,770
few months ago YouTube and went on a

417
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,230
path of us saying that they were trying

418
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:02,950
to protect kids online I'm one of the

419
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:04,990
things that they did was for any videos

420
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,570
that had kids in it that seemed to be

421
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:10,000
doing something that could be beat and I

422
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,639
say could be deemed inappropriate they

423
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,880
started to monetize videos on disable

424
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,180
comments this primarily was on family

425
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,730
vlog channels one of the examples was

426
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:24,810
that I that I came across was a family

427
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,280
where their young son did gymnastics and

428
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:30,520
for all of the videos that they posted

429
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,620
the primary and videos that remains

430
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,200
demonetized when they complained about

431
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,659
this we're the ones with their son doing

432
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,290
gymnastics he was doing a sport that he

433
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:43,360
loved he's only five I think and you

434
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:45,990
tuber basically saying your child is

435
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,000
doing a sport that someone might find

436
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:51,640
that they can use for their own horrible

437
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,430
reasons and you find pleasure in them in

438
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,920
a really horrible way I'm here being at

439
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,020
a detriment because you're putting this

440
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,700
on the internet so your child is

441
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,800
annoying not being able to share what

442
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,020
they love because someone else might be

443
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,510
doing something about this all came

444
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,730
about because the advertisers for

445
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,160
YouTube find out that there was people

446
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,820
making horrible comments in videos on

447
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:19,630
some some of these types of videos and

448
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:21,929
they claimed that this was to YouTube

449
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:25,030
think that this was to protect the kids

450
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,600
but in reality it was to make sure that

451
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,210
there are

452
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,939
Kaiser's happy so that they could keep

453
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:35,350
making money off their advertisers and

454
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:37,390
so it is good to hear the companies are

455
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,000
thinking about this on our considering

456
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:42,250
what is being put onto the internet but

457
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,080
in this particular instance YouTube did

458
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,660
not go the right way in terms of trying

459
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,149
to protect kids they were inherently

460
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,679
protecting themselves I'm Joe Spacek

461
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,110
they making it easier for someone to

462
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:55,360
make use of a video because the video

463
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,549
still were online they wasn't that they

464
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,590
were breaching copyright or breaching

465
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:02,408
terms conditions to the point of being

466
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:05,320
taken off the internet they were just

467
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:07,450
taking away the potential livelihoods of

468
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,520
the kids in these videos because some of

469
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,070
these loggers that is their entire life

470
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,379
they make money off the videos that they

471
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,990
they produce and so any of those videos

472
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,390
being demonetized that kid was

473
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:22,179
potentially like money because that is

474
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:24,429
what their parents do for a living so

475
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:28,200
really they were hindering the children

476
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:31,470
and their lives rather than helping them

477
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,750
one of the other topics here is those

478
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:37,809
social media influencers the young kids

479
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:42,159
that have all of their social media

480
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:44,230
accounts content that they put up of

481
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,289
course should be being monitored by

482
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:50,559
their parents so even the teenagers

483
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:52,840
maybe they have a right to be on these

484
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,090
platforms the content that they share

485
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,939
should definitely be monitored by their

486
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,980
parents because what they share online

487
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,929
especially the more famous they get more

488
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,520
well-known they get the quicker things

489
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:07,090
spread the quicker rumors spread about

490
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,809
anything that they say we thought we're

491
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:12,699
moving into the slightly older side of

492
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:16,360
the talk here we've got the tweenty

493
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:19,360
young adults and a lot of logging stuff

494
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:22,178
there and runs into this right it's kind

495
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,520
of shared with them YouTube it

496
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:27,039
predominantly affects pretty much

497
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,840
everyone and anyone on YouTube can't

498
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,360
share too much but when it comes to a

499
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,860
kid they often don't have a choice they

500
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,610
often don't understand what they

501
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:39,399
shouldn't shouldn't say so we then have

502
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:42,909
these young people here just are

503
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,280
their life in social media they are

504
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,200
getting their first phone so I remember

505
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,110
when I got my first mobile phone I was

506
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,910
11 it was an opiate it had sneak on it

507
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,429
and it had a Harry Potter cover

508
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:57,190
I've liked Harry Potter since then and

509
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,740
it didn't do anything that films do

510
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,480
today kids are getting younger and

511
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,250
younger as they get their first device

512
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,830
which means they're getting younger and

513
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:08,580
younger up being able to use any of the

514
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:10,659
apps that are available on those devices

515
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,360
that's the first topic we're going to

516
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:16,630
talk about so the mobile apps in which

517
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,159
kids are using these days I'm not that

518
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,559
cool with the kids I don't know exactly

519
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,960
what all of the apps are being used but

520
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,660
these are just soft the ones that I am

521
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:30,730
aware of some of them I do actually use

522
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:33,340
myself so the main reason why I bring up

523
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:36,070
these particular apps at least words

524
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,678
with friends in fortnight our particular

525
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:41,050
God if you looked at these apps as a

526
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,450
parent who doesn't use these particular

527
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:46,240
apps you may not know that there is a

528
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:48,820
way to communicate with anyone on these

529
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,780
apps so anyone who uses words with

530
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:55,450
friends you request to play here with a

531
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,940
random stranger here goes make a move

532
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,830
and instantly a chat function comes up

533
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,620
you can talk to that person you can say

534
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:04,260
whatever you want to that person they

535
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,750
can say whatever they want to you and

536
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,129
for a kid who has just about their first

537
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,920
phone in whose thing's all this is

538
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:14,230
really cool that can be the friend they

539
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,840
are not necessarily aware of what they

540
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:20,920
should and shouldn't be saying and they

541
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:23,770
shouldn't shouldn't be talking to so my

542
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,900
point from these particular apps is when

543
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,550
I looked up the descriptions for them as

544
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,070
I'm trying to look at it from the point

545
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,770
of view of someone who is not

546
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:34,659
particularly security aware or an

547
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:36,070
internet where you know where did it say

548
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,679
on words with friends that you can't

549
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:41,950
have a proper conversation with someone

550
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:43,809
that you don't know so there is no

551
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,700
adding someone who's in your area

552
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:47,299
there's none of that it's just you start

553
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:51,080
a Congress

554
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:54,830
on it opens a conversation so to many

555
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,449
parents this up maybe you okay you're

556
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,840
playing Scrabble with your friends

557
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,580
basically but actually it's a lot more

558
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,709
serious than not in terms of that

559
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,799
functionality to communicate with the

560
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,850
wider world because that child could be

561
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,929
talking to anybody

562
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:14,320
one could be saying anything to anybody

563
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:17,149
so when it comes to the experiences of

564
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,580
my 13 year old niece who you got it from

565
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:22,309
a couple years ago for every app that

566
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:25,039
you don't lose it's a quick line side

567
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:26,809
what type of app is it um for the most

568
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,850
part it's very hard to tell what

569
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:31,369
actually is in that up until you've gone

570
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:33,980
into it until you've actually played it

571
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:35,749
until you've seen what is being done

572
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,019
within that up many of them are just

573
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:41,779
games they're just playing a random game

574
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:45,559
like candy crush as an example it is

575
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:47,779
just a single-player game where there's

576
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,539
many others that are not on it's very

577
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:53,359
hard to tell so as a parent hard

578
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:55,369
human to actually say yes or no what

579
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,379
slide actually having been on that app

580
00:24:55,369 --> 00:25:01,609
yourself and actually looked into the

581
00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:05,059
features of it so this particular is

582
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:07,989
just more of a hotties that make sure

583
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:12,309
that the kids as they use these apps are

584
00:25:07,989 --> 00:25:15,700
protecting themselves and are aware of

585
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:18,590
functionalities within those apps on and

586
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,950
making sure that they are safe with what

587
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,330
they do

588
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:25,159
um people are potentially more familiar

589
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:28,549
with Pinterest and read it as more of a

590
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:31,220
community based application but as I

591
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:34,100
said for parents who maybe aren't in

592
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,230
this particular interested in these

593
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,269
sorts of apps they may not know when

594
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:42,289
they if they don't dig deep into what is

595
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:44,809
going on with these applications so this

596
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:47,749
is just a small subset of the types of

597
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:52,639
apps that are potentially dangerous for

598
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:55,420
kids on their mobile devices and we will

599
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:59,959
move into these slightly more scary ones

600
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:02,720
so a couple of things avoid these tre

601
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,790
social media apps as a parent you're

602
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,250
more likely to know what these are on

603
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:10,129
what the types of functionality are and

604
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:12,200
that they are predominantly to do with

605
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,300
sharing content they are to do with

606
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,000
sharing updates about your life talking

607
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,480
to people sharing pictures all of that

608
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,490
sort of thing

609
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,390
right that is what these predominantly

610
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:25,100
are for but kids don't necessarily know

611
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,530
what they shouldn't shouldn't share they

612
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,320
aren't necessarily aware of the fact

613
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:33,350
that a lot of the content on these these

614
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,590
sort of platforms contain a lot of fake

615
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:38,659
information so we've all heard figures

616
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,669
but even a picture of your best friend

617
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,990
on the Internet should be completely

618
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,900
different to what they look like in real

619
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:47,510
life and something that is not talked

620
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:51,370
about enough is that the Internet is not

621
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:53,870
a true representation of someone's life

622
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:58,310
something I've heard a lot going around

623
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:59,929
is this talk of IRL friends so heard a

624
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:03,110
lot of things on Twitter of people

625
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,970
talking about their IRL friends and for

626
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,820
anyone who's not sure what that means it

627
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:10,940
means in real life friends so there's

628
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,649
this disconnect between the people that

629
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,510
you know in real life people that you

630
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:16,790
physically go out and see you go to

631
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:19,640
school with you work with they are

632
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:24,080
you're in real life friends this bits

633
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:27,190
are really bad and image of the Internet

634
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:31,370
to young inflamed influence vegetable

635
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:35,200
sorry I'm sure that was my word and kids

636
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:38,389
are in are getting onto the internet

637
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,430
they're seeing the Internet as my fake

638
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,290
flicks right the people on the other end

639
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:44,320
of the screen aren't necessarily real

640
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:47,000
because they're not in your real life

641
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,370
but actually the Internet is people's

642
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,570
moves in real life they're sharing what

643
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:54,590
they're doing every day and they're

644
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:57,649
sharing pictures of their lives and so

645
00:27:54,590 --> 00:28:00,560
this term both in real life really it's

646
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:03,140
not disconnect between people that you

647
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,610
know are people that you don't own the

648
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,460
people you're talking to on the internet

649
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:13,909
and it does need to be

650
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:16,160
or of a I would awareness what actually

651
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:19,010
happens on the internet is true is real

652
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,900
it's things that other people can see is

653
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,910
a person on the other end

654
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,440
I'm not confined to a lot of the

655
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:28,430
bullying that happens on the internet

656
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,400
and you can see it a lot in internet

657
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:34,610
trolls who just want to mass avoid and

658
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:37,910
poke fun of people and that does come

659
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:40,159
down even to true real life situations

660
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:44,060
it makes it easier to Billy someone in

661
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,470
your skill for example because you then

662
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,330
know that person and you knew their

663
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,160
social medias and you can then create

664
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,020
Phoebe crunch there's not quite ability

665
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,540
on the internet because you don't have

666
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:57,050
to prove who you are to have a kind so i

667
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:59,600
kids these days are meeting and fan

668
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:02,389
accounts so that they can talk about

669
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,179
that particular person or group that

670
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:07,910
they like and then when something

671
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,920
happens I can avoid someone that maybe

672
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:12,140
they have deemed is an enemy out there

673
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,330
their particular fan are there

674
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,310
particular celebrity their funnel they

675
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:19,310
then end up having this horrible

676
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:21,460
conversation between finders where they

677
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:25,399
start hitting on each other for example

678
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,840
and that's something that is generally

679
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,850
speaking not something that would happen

680
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,350
in a physical world you wouldn't

681
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,149
necessarily have the same kind of

682
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,879
arguments you can say the same sorts of

683
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:37,220
things to each other in a real-world

684
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,490
setting and that doesn't make it better

685
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:43,880
because those things can be said

686
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:46,190
anywhere and it's something that very

687
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,080
much needs to be an awareness for

688
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:53,060
parents and awareness for kids to

689
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:55,010
understand what happens online so I want

690
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:58,340
to get into a little bit about these

691
00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:01,820
social media apps and more sites because

692
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,439
they do have eat restrictions so I

693
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,629
double-checked because then you need to

694
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,660
do is avoid 13 it's generally speaking

695
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:11,510
the Egyptians for your social yobs

696
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:15,320
that's true so Facebook Instagram

697
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:18,520
Twitter they are all minimum age of 13

698
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:22,090
and I guarantee everyone English

699
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:26,530
has known someone or seen someone on

700
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:30,580
social media is not yet 30 and if that

701
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:33,639
happens all that these companies say to

702
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:35,919
do is here the step 2 to delete data

703
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,780
quite right as a parent if your child

704
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,020
under the age of 13 has created on a

705
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,760
pint here's how to delete it I guarantee

706
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,650
you there's at least one person in this

707
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,679
room who knows a family member or a

708
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:50,020
friend has created that account for that

709
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,120
child didn't seek information so that

710
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,820
that child can have an Instagram account

711
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,979
a Facebook account so that they can talk

712
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:00,480
to their friends their parents have also

713
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:03,880
created a kind that they should not have

714
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:07,480
if those arc lights are and reported us

715
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,540
than being underage and they also have

716
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,340
to verify that that child is under 13

717
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,980
before they will disable it hi I

718
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:18,490
understand why in that if they are over

719
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,110
13 then that seems a bit unfair but in

720
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:22,300
the grand scheme of things if it's

721
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:24,399
obvious that child is under 13 there

722
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:28,678
should be better mechanisms to protect

723
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:31,240
those kids from the social media lights

724
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,950
there is one that I particularly want to

725
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,929
mention and you may have noticed I

726
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:38,260
haven't mentioned it yet that is what's

727
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:40,570
up when I looked at the eat restrictions

728
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:45,580
for what's up what's up the intersection

729
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:47,620
is 16 plus what's up in itself is text

730
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,649
messaging it's an internet service to

731
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,570
text a number that you have yes you can

732
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,670
guess a numbers for texting random

733
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,889
people but you could do that with a

734
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,290
regular messaging service which you get

735
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:01,360
with your phone there is no age

736
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:04,629
restriction with the option there app on

737
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,300
your phone so something that really I

738
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:10,330
don't personally understand that is why

739
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:13,059
do you need to be 16 and generally speak

740
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:15,370
a little bit more mature you have a wall

741
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:18,639
top appointment to be able to text a

742
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:20,050
direct message to a direct number that

743
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,290
you do to be able to share your entire

744
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:26,409
life with the world you know you on

745
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:28,170
Facebook you could add everyone that you

746
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,520
are

747
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:33,640
potential a potential friend so you

748
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:36,280
might know and you could be 13 you could

749
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:41,440
be as young as 13 or younger because we

750
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:43,030
all know that happens and the social

751
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,670
media is a very scary place when it

752
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:49,960
comes to the next generation just

753
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:53,200
because it is sharing of so much content

754
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,270
and so much of it is fake so much of it

755
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,100
it is portrayed in a particular way that

756
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:59,110
young people don't necessarily

757
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,790
understand nor the parents a lot of

758
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:04,959
parents a lot of adults don't

759
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:08,889
necessarily and see the true nature of

760
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,690
the dangers of social media I will

761
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:13,300
personally admit that I have a little

762
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:15,400
bit of issues but I Constitution media

763
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,200
and I tweeted yesterday that I was doing

764
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,700
this talk gun the whole night was going

765
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,750
how many people have liked my tweet and

766
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:25,020
I know that's bad and something that

767
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:28,150
that is something that if I'm doing it

768
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,950
kids also doing up there feeling valued

769
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,750
by the number of lights that they're

770
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,550
boosts are getting I'm the number of

771
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,370
comments that they get number people to

772
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:38,080
share it that's something people are

773
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:40,689
taking belly in and it's because of the

774
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,580
social media culture and it's definitely

775
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:44,380
something that we need to make sure the

776
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,879
next generation are aware that just

777
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,260
because someone doesn't like your tween

778
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,670
or some of those objects are they like

779
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:53,290
me doesn't necessarily mean that they

780
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:55,240
are a bad person it doesn't mean they're

781
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:57,070
a bad person it just means that someone

782
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,250
has a different opinion um that's okay

783
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:01,780
but on social media for the most part

784
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,670
you have a different opinion and you say

785
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,170
that to the wrong person you end up with

786
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:10,300
a lot of other people who just be

787
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:15,159
quarter than you so how do we protect

788
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:17,950
kids from all of this stuff for the most

789
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:20,710
part it should be protected by their

790
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:22,149
parents you know parents is the one

791
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,590
that's giving them a phone in the parent

792
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:25,990
is the one that's giving the permission

793
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:27,820
to do what they want to on that phone

794
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:31,029
so one of those things is parental

795
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:33,070
controls so whether that is through the

796
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:35,470
device itself through any of the

797
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,560
mechanisms that are available from the

798
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:40,159
platforms

799
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:46,460
as an example would be one making his

800
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:50,480
use and future kids to point but a lot

801
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:53,690
of the time on and parents that I've

802
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,670
seen saying things like I don't want to

803
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:59,210
look at my kids phone because my child

804
00:34:55,670 --> 00:35:01,760
should have a privacy and it's the most

805
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:04,400
part those kids are maybe thirteen

806
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,140
fourteen and that parent is basically

807
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,600
saying they should have a free-for-all

808
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:11,990
on the internet because they need their

809
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,930
own privacy and with that I understand

810
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:17,899
some of it I guarantee before the

811
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:20,149
internet for mobile devices any any kid

812
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,710
that root in a diary their parents were

813
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,680
looking at that diary if they find it

814
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,780
right and they wanted to do mostly to

815
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,359
make sure that they are okay make sure

816
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:32,570
their kid is happy healthy all that

817
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:35,810
stuff but if you give your kid on

818
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:38,150
unlimited access to their device and you

819
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,680
never ask them on it you never find out

820
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:42,350
what they're doing what apps they're

821
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,720
using you have no idea what's going on

822
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:49,240
in that child's life and that can be

823
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:52,160
very scary so one other thing but um

824
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:55,040
they say we protecting kids from their

825
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,770
devices is monitoring apps so I'm sure

826
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,410
sake I've seen advertised an app that

827
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,800
you can put on your child's phone and it

828
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,720
either

829
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,070
Shuchi all of the apps that are in stole

830
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,410
the lodge should be see pictures that

831
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:09,080
are signing those sorts of things those

832
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:11,480
apps are aimed at parents with young

833
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,770
kids or with kids with phones we all

834
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,960
know they can't be used maliciously I

835
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:20,180
personally don't recommend putting a

836
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,940
device app like that on the phone was

837
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,770
like telling that child's I personally

838
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,380
believe that those kids should have

839
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:29,350
knowledge of how much they can do on

840
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:33,770
their device have an open conversation

841
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:36,520
between the child and the parent to make

842
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:37,509
sure that anything that you online is

843
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,070
something that they can talk about

844
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,140
something that they can bring out if

845
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,150
they are experiencing bullying for

846
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:46,089
example on the internet they can come

847
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:47,950
and talk about it but as a 13 year old

848
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:50,830
at the youngest in terms of the social

849
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:53,100
media apps monitoring out device whether

850
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:55,960
it be through an app or just even a

851
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,870
every couple of days every every week

852
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,760
every whatever regular conversation with

853
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,290
that child watching about their day

854
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,240
their sitting on the sofa with their

855
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:07,630
back to you because they don't want look

856
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,910
at you having an ability to talk with

857
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:11,740
that child and make sure that you see

858
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:13,420
what they're doing on that device make

859
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,279
sure that you see what conversations

860
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,990
they're having to make sure that they're

861
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,730
aware of what they shouldn't should be

862
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:21,759
doing online having that conversation

863
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:24,190
being open with them it's something that

864
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,950
we definitely need more off because kids

865
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:28,630
are inherently doing and talking about

866
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,370
things that they really probably

867
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,990
shouldn't or should be a little bit

868
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:33,400
nicer to each other if everyone was a

869
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:39,549
little bit nicer to each other and the

870
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:43,300
internet would be a much nicer place so

871
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:46,540
next up and almost there is a ulcers

872
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:48,760
possibility so I've talked about these

873
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:52,890
ops the state of things that people use

874
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,450
them for I do believe that these

875
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:57,250
companies should be really thinking

876
00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:00,069
about how to protect the people that

877
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:02,170
they're using the apps we all know apps

878
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:04,600
are printed on immediately someone has

879
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,850
an malicious way to use the particular

880
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,529
application and so I'm not saying you

881
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:10,480
don't create anything that's definitely

882
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:12,220
not the way to go but we do need to have

883
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,020
major shins basically we are getting

884
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:18,250
better there are ways to report

885
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:20,230
different posts or comments though such

886
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,270
things but we need them to be easier to

887
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:25,420
see we need kids to be aware of them a

888
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:28,870
lot of the time and people have these

889
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:31,840
clients for so long that they aren't

890
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:34,089
familiar with the new additions because

891
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,710
no one necessarily tells you if

892
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,540
something's added to Facebook do you

893
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:41,440
actually get a step by step of how to

894
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:43,270
use it looks likely not all right so

895
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,330
parents may not be familiar with the

896
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,509
ways in which they can and

897
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,560
the kids on encourage the kids to report

898
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:52,380
potentially dangerous things on the

899
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,730
internet then we have parents who talk

900
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,770
to a lot of white parents and their

901
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:58,260
responsibility or with protecting their

902
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:00,990
kids online a lot of it comes going to

903
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,120
open communication ensuring that while

904
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:05,009
they're being taught how to be a human

905
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,049
and how to converse with people which

906
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,720
I'll admit I'm not very good at at the

907
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:12,120
best of times these kids need to be

908
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:15,270
taught how to behave online it's not

909
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:18,810
just just online that's okay it needs to

910
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:22,170
be in actual social issue of being able

911
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:24,210
to communicate with each other we don't

912
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:27,000
have the kids themselves so I'm sure

913
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:29,490
where babies do not have a choice that's

914
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,450
entirely up to parents when a newborn is

915
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:32,790
put on the Internet

916
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:34,980
pictures videos whatever that is the

917
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,080
parent that is entirely on the parent to

918
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:40,560
make sure that they are protecting that

919
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:42,900
child's but as the child gets older into

920
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,759
the days in which they are being allowed

921
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,670
to go outside with their friends they're

922
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,170
getting a devices than itself that's

923
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,720
when they start taking on their own

924
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:53,850
responsibilities so what you put online

925
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,410
as soon as you have access to an account

926
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:58,230
you done you can read and write and you

927
00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:00,660
can share things that becomes part of

928
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:03,000
your responsibility no I would say not

929
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,470
entirely because you generally learn

930
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,910
from the people that you are surrounded

931
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:11,430
by but you're still responsible as a

932
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:13,830
1314 to sharing content you need to be

933
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,279
aware of what you're doing on the

934
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,900
Internet

935
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,240
that does come with the states and

936
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,890
everyone makes mistakes but a lot of

937
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,080
that comes from feedback parents on

938
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:24,390
feedback from friends on the community

939
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,870
to make sure that they are doing their

940
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:30,120
best with what they have and then we

941
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:32,880
have schools in government so there are

942
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,980
programs in place for teaching and

943
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,170
cybersecurity teaching how to behave

944
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:40,260
online on actually just yesterday and

945
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:42,570
was talking to you and someone who had

946
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:44,760
said that they went into school and

947
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:47,070
we're doing a cybersecurity talk they

948
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,960
were explaining to kids that when you

949
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:52,710
take a picture of your friend you make

950
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,780
sure you have their permission at the

951
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:58,320
same time the Ted teacher at that school

952
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,250
was taking pictures of all those kids of

953
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,170
a particular

954
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:05,670
person I went question when query they

955
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,740
didn't really understand why that person

956
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:10,200
didn't want their company and they were

957
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,189
like well what's the problem and they

958
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,279
just didn't want their picture on

959
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:15,720
Facebook that had teacher sharing not

960
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,510
actually listening to that conversation

961
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,850
they had not actually taken in because

962
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:23,640
they said oh but that talk was for the

963
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:25,890
kids so why would the adults need to

964
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:29,190
also learn those things and that's a

965
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:31,259
really important part of the people I

966
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:33,300
write those kids are telling them how

967
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,670
they should be here and so they also

968
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:40,890
need to be educated as much as the kids

969
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:44,190
themselves do and what parents are

970
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:46,170
unaware odd things can happen so while I

971
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:49,110
was organizing and putting together this

972
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:51,360
table I had seen before Evie ously lots

973
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:53,510
of people had shared speech and

974
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,690
[Music]

975
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:59,510
competitions I see I suppose and from

976
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:03,810
the legitimate websites right our

977
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:05,580
unofficial alliance right so this is two

978
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:08,220
examples those three people that are on

979
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:10,350
my facebook Hey all three of these

980
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:13,830
people are parents to have them work

981
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:16,259
with kids for their day job and they all

982
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:18,830
shared two separate dominos pages that

983
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:22,320
were not real they both have the same

984
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:25,230
host avoids winning to treat heart

985
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,500
diseases that's not really something

986
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:32,220
that is unlikely for dominance to do but

987
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:35,520
if you see the picture on the right hand

988
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:37,520
side there that's the real dog each its

989
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,340
donors pizza with your little blue

990
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,320
circle with a with the checkmark in it

991
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:45,350
they have not seen the small steps to

992
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,800
make sure that that was a tree

993
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:49,830
legitimate point

994
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,570
I got shared of anyway I actually did

995
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:53,160
speak with these people and just sort of

996
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,730
said you know these aren't true your

997
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,520
minds

998
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,660
be careful one of them had said that it

999
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,490
was their friend that had shared this

1000
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,990
with them and they would go back and

1001
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,330
share that with their friends because

1002
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,759
these are simple steps that are there

1003
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,860
are in grant

1004
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,530
in applications but aren't necessarily

1005
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:12,110
no and aren't necessarily aware for

1006
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,550
Dalton parents these but if these

1007
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:16,370
particular parents are very well

1008
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:19,070
educated on working with kids because

1009
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:21,790
they work with kids they do understand

1010
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:23,960
lots of cyber security in terms of

1011
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:25,490
sharing information and then they can

1012
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,690
share pictures of kids with like parents

1013
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:28,490
permission that's all is that sort of

1014
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:30,680
stuff but when it comes to their own

1015
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:33,589
lives they're not necessarily as I

1016
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,850
heated as we need them to be I don't

1017
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,650
actually know what the end game of this

1018
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:38,690
was it was probably just fishing for

1019
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:41,000
information email addresses credit card

1020
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:44,660
numbers whatever they asked for to get

1021
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,980
your pizzas um I didn't feel like

1022
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:50,120
wanting to share it because that would

1023
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:53,000
be a body tumble right and that's it

1024
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:56,810
with that I want to end with a picture

1025
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,080
of my kids this is my cat Dobby and my

1026
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:02,930
dog chips and they are just misbehaved

1027
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:06,500
all the time if you want to follow me on

1028
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:07,750
Twitter as it said it awesomesauce like

1029
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,869
very much for listening to me

1030
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,869
[Music]

1031
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:25,019
have any questions before right you

1032
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:28,589
could always turn around to set up to

1033
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:32,848
make shoulder it turns out a propriety

1034
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:34,950
boat that crosses the line of personal

1035
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:38,759
privacy that companies they're taking

1036
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:41,160
between privacy else was right and so I

1037
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:43,829
actually believe there is talk of making

1038
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:47,239
a way in which this is kind of going a

1039
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:47,239
bit off-topic but there is a way of

1040
00:44:47,329 --> 00:44:52,650
there trying to create identification

1041
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,390
I'm a centralized location where you

1042
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:57,749
prove that you're with the inner beauty

1043
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:59,879
so this comes from it I think it came

1044
00:44:57,749 --> 00:45:01,950
from a podcast actually where where I

1045
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,799
heard this and in terms of trying to

1046
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,868
access auto websites on that there is

1047
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:09,719
going to be attempt to make it that you

1048
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:12,029
can access them without this centralized

1049
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,279
identification so I definitely don't

1050
00:45:12,029 --> 00:45:16,410
think that every single company sign up

1051
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:18,509
for you should have access to your

1052
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,038
password or your driver's license or

1053
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:21,690
your birth certificate there should

1054
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:24,599
definitely be a centralized way of doing

1055
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:28,380
but that is something that would create

1056
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:37,589
some type of a capability when it comes

1057
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:40,859
to being on the internet basically and

1058
00:45:37,589 --> 00:45:44,069
also identify himself with the article

1059
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:49,578
citizen we were but now partly on both

1060
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:49,579
of this you registered with them and

1061
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:57,629
sort of idea yeah and the problem there

1062
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:59,249
is obviously what type of third party

1063
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,829
right you need to trust the third party

1064
00:45:59,249 --> 00:46:03,689
with your information and not that a lot

1065
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:05,489
of people really care because many

1066
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:08,160
people would say stop if I don't

1067
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:09,479
remembers so many people were like I'm

1068
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,629
already giving my information to

1069
00:46:09,479 --> 00:46:13,379
Facebook why do I care but actually this

1070
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:15,150
is a whole

1071
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,590
banane that you're doing exactly the

1072
00:46:15,150 --> 00:47:13,200
same thing with a bajillion other

1073
00:46:16,590 --> 00:47:15,720
companies it's not actually yeah no I

1074
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:19,319
definitely agree a lot of it comes from

1075
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:22,080
the social life that the kid has offline

1076
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:26,100
can affect their online presence but I

1077
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:28,290
know personally as a very my problem

1078
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:31,290
we're pretty and well informed when I

1079
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:34,320
was young I still meet many mistakes

1080
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:38,180
online and so it that is definitely a

1081
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:41,610
big aspect and but it's something that

1082
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:45,540
all of those things eat a little bit

1083
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:47,910
more protection for kids everything

1084
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:49,920
needs a little bit more and when it

1085
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:52,500
comes to whereas researching this most

1086
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,780
of it came from internal family and so

1087
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,270
if I was to do another talk with him may

1088
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:59,130
end up day and I would want to write run

1089
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:01,080
try a little bit more into the wider

1090
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:09,810
community and see what other people feel

1091
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:11,370
and is where these issues I felt very

1092
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,049
much for a research person so I would

1093
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:14,480
have to investigate about to see where I

1094
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:24,320
would go with love

1095
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:31,490
yep there's a cool shot right back

1096
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:37,400
she doesn't look like this but I

1097
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:41,200
actually have a desirable safety my love

1098
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:44,750
looks mostly from this little virtual

1099
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:49,910
environment to little sister now

1100
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:53,060
lobsters and she's well but I never a

1101
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:57,350
lot parents are not as involved in this

1102
00:48:53,060 --> 00:49:01,609
kind of industry do do love reliance on

1103
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:04,190
the principal problems and she's got

1104
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:05,960
grounders threatened controls I should

1105
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:10,310
go see little kids to go around the

1106
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:12,109
front and I think you know I mean I had

1107
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:17,779
a conversation happy about their

1108
00:49:12,109 --> 00:49:20,840
parental controls were right and they

1109
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:22,130
were you know she's around as old as

1110
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,790
time

1111
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:27,560
yeah which is very frustrating and but

1112
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:30,050
she'll some nerves that I would pick up

1113
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:36,520
and in fact and when trolls and

1114
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:36,520
commissioning that Lucy I kind of custom

1115
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:47,780
all wrestler and knocking on then you

1116
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:53,020
know parish everywhere I really need to

1117
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:56,180
do that because we don't bother standing

1118
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:59,770
crashes on the kids workmanship young

1119
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:03,799
yang back thirteen-year-old barrier and

1120
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:07,250
you know is in slaughter Marian's really

1121
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:09,410
kick it will sign it now and so did

1122
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,420
absently where there was some

1123
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:16,640
verification I think generally that

1124
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:20,540
would be really but I appreciate also

1125
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:23,020
from that would be a very different gas

1126
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:36,400
constant that as well because they're it

1127
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:38,800
a little bit us for the barrier in terms

1128
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,060
of restriction I do feel like companies

1129
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,920
probably don't want that in general

1130
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:44,620
because they know a lot of their users

1131
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,390
are young they knew that they don't they

1132
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,700
would lose a lot of their market if they

1133
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:53,160
did put those researchers in taste so

1134
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:53,160
yeah I praise you for the way you're as

1135
00:50:55,530 --> 00:51:07,150
well one of the things I think it goes

1136
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:18,010
through life brings lip regarding both

1137
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:20,650
of that process and above everyone else

1138
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:23,710
may say don't you review it before a

1139
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:26,890
starling sources then food because I'm

1140
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:32,020
actually bid to do that with it now give

1141
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:35,910
me a lot more faith in bull initiatives

1142
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,910
which stay with an email account that I

1143
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:48,280
know was all that any kind of second

1144
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:50,050
part well things happen here so it is

1145
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:58,900
the the parental side of things is

1146
00:51:50,050 --> 00:52:00,190
really important how do you think the

1147
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:05,230
change of next five years

1148
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:07,510
yes so much people talk about it you

1149
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:09,070
know and the Internet's always teaching

1150
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:11,260
everything we do online is always

1151
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:14,380
changing so it very much depends on the

1152
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:16,270
way anything goes in terms of do we fit

1153
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,470
in say it's ways of proving who you are

1154
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:19,450
your age

1155
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:22,180
do we not how do we then manage that I

1156
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:23,770
personally don't really know and I know

1157
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,080
there are a 10

1158
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:27,910
to make things better but whether or not

1159
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:31,060
they're in the right direction whether

1160
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:41,080
they actually will do anything I really

1161
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:43,360
don't know I think this generation get

1162
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,069
older and they experience a lot of

1163
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,290
what's going on on the Internet

1164
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:49,060
they will then have that effect of well

1165
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:51,940
I don't want my kid to have to deal with

1166
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:54,640
that so I'll teach them how to be used

1167
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,920
better and but I think that would take a

1168
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:00,790
while because obviously it's still very

1169
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:03,930
young and that would take a bit safe to

1170
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:03,930
get out of people
