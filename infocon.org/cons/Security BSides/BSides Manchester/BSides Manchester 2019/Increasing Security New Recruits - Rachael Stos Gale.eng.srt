1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,220
you

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:12,959
right so I'll stop I went to b-sides

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:17,789
leaves in January of this year and when

4
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:21,990
I did that I was in security I wasn't in

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:26,550
IT I've been at home as a housewife for

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,470
7 years 7 to 8 and I've been reading

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,610
about the CCN it's been reading the book

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,560
doing some study was that but I thought

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,370
security would be something that might

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,230
be interested in I had followed people

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,570
on Twitter and security accounts for

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,550
years I never thought of it as something

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:51,030
that I could do and the last minute I am

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:55,230
managed to blag a ticket to definitely

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,940
sold out B site leads by saying hello am

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,828
i worthy cause I've got towel care if

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,539
anybody's got a free ticket let me know

18
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,199
I'd really like to go and see the the

19
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,600
keynotes

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,170
you know please you know if anybody has

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,550
well let me know so I tagged in the

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,470
keynote speaker with that because I did

23
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,429
want to see her she retweeted thank you

24
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:17,130
very much and that and then I got him

25
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:19,140
very kindly chat from Symantec said oh

26
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,740
I've got spare one you know you have

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:28,710
mine so as I thank you and I came I saw

28
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:31,589
a whole selection of talks and I was

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:36,539
really excited so Owens away

30
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:40,230
and studied and not long after that I

31
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,090
got my first job in security and doing

32
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:47,610
exactly what I wanted to be doing so

33
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:51,560
this talk is really about how I came to

34
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,850
be in security from the point of view of

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,290
somebody who is completely outside the

36
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,179
sector but hopefully there's something

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:03,480
useful there for you if you're already

38
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:04,920
in IT or if you're students and and this

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,410
hopefully will have something in it as

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,610
well for people do recruitment if you're

41
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,470
thinking that's your standards

42
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,120
passive recruitment aren't always

43
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,160
furnishing you with the range of

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,050
candidates that you'd like hopefully

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,970
we've got somewhere and some ideas here

46
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:25,190
about ten how to find other people so

47
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:28,990
first thing we often hear if we can't

48
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,650
get the people why not well we know that

49
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,690
basically there aren't enough to go

50
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,770
around that the figures on this or

51
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:39,500
something like by 2022 just in Europe

52
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,820
this meant to be a shortfall of security

53
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,850
professionals of about three hundred and

54
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:48,230
fifty thousand people so it's huge

55
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:49,670
it's a new sector but there aren't

56
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,010
enough people to go around who are

57
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,500
already qualified if you're going to

58
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:58,220
recruit people for entry-level positions

59
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:00,050
and we're in a good position to look for

60
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,790
people who aren't already in security

61
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,680
potentially go and see didn't I teach

62
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,090
but the question then is will there be

63
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,670
any good that's what you want to know

64
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:11,810
and will they be ready soon because a

65
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,369
lot of pathways and suggests you know

66
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,290
yet you can do this come to our degree

67
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,270
and I thought what I could do but I've

68
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,929
got you know but it's agree I've got a

69
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:24,770
professional qualification and I can't

70
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,780
really at that stage I thought I can't

71
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,320
go back to uni and do it all again I

72
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,060
just need to find a way in and so what

73
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,739
are the barriers to peer to entry for

74
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,550
people who contemplating their career

75
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:39,709
change no these are my thoughts so time

76
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:43,010
the investments of time are you going to

77
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:45,709
you know I'm 37 now I didn't really want

78
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,120
to spend three years doing an

79
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:51,709
undergraduate degree in a completely

80
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,050
different area money also I've got

81
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,000
student that's already you know you've

82
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,980
got to think how much is it going to

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,560
cost you to get into the sector that you

84
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,488
want and the third point security in

85
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,440
this case is it is a safe bet but the

86
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:10,040
biggest thing I think that so a problem

87
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,670
within security and recruitment is that

88
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,739
nobody outside knows what we do they

89
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,450
don't know the the roles of job roles

90
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,060
they don't know how they fit together

91
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,099
how that built into a career past even

92
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,410
within the sector

93
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,180
kind of we're all slightly Mavericks

94
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,160
finding their own way to its you know

95
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,530
great the job of time and now I'm an

96
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,450
analyst I can go to be a senior analyst

97
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,679
and as hecklers have passed there so

98
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,810
that you know or I could go in a

99
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,360
different direction but it's hard to

100
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,280
tell from outside what it is what it

101
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,170
looks like even if you go on prospects

102
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,570
start at UK you know Career Service

103
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,700
website it doesn't really tell you very

104
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,620
much about what the job entails so it's

105
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,360
hard to know what to apply for it

106
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,190
doesn't tell you very much about how the

107
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,640
rules fit together and build into a

108
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:58,510
career if that's something we can gets

109
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,190
out then we're in a much better place to

110
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:04,270
help people understand that it's worth

111
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:07,230
coming in so my comments here is why

112
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,909
take people from outside IT now this is

113
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,440
a slide that's kind of focused it

114
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,170
recruiters I'm jumping backwards on

115
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,910
boards all the time between hopefully

116
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,890
they're kind of applicant size and

117
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,350
they're approved aside so my take people

118
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,000
from outside IT for the first points

119
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,240
you've got more people to choose from

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,730
good starts second career changes of

121
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,590
extra skill the skills so my point there

122
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,690
about since accents customers needs if

123
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:36,700
you have somebody who's been working in

124
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:38,980
the automotive industry or in HR or in

125
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,890
everybody needs security some of your

126
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:44,410
customers will have that kind of

127
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,900
different world you know to you and if

128
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,720
your team comprises people who know that

129
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,179
sector or who know something about it

130
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,580
then you're getting for the same price

131
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:58,150
as your other new entrants you're

132
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,950
getting some extra expertise that can

133
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,799
help you home to your customers needs

134
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:07,060
and different emotional and soft skills

135
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:10,630
are honed by different roles now my

136
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:13,660
thinking here with this one is different

137
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,820
roles need different skills so if you

138
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,160
have somebody who's say been working a

139
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,780
night shift in the care home they will

140
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,400
look probably at some point how to do

141
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,869
that make that decision

142
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,900
don't call an ambulance now for this

143
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,150
person do I alert my superior or do I do

144
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,020
I just know Nightline right now if

145
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,489
you're making that kind of

146
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,789
life-and-death decision to look after

147
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,000
some

148
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,680
else you're an very well-placed to make

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,930
the decision and feel brave about it

150
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,340
when you think right I'm here on my own

151
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,750
in the office of you know with a

152
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:46,570
skeleton staff at like 3 a.m. on Sunday

153
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,790
morning do I now wake up this director

154
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:51,310
and say I can't leave any kinda get

155
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,140
through to anybody else on the calling

156
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,550
tree but I think there's an incident you

157
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,409
need to get up out of bed somewhere

158
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,420
everybody up because that you know it

159
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:02,230
takes some nerve so that's the next bit

160
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,810
grave as can be if you are doing a

161
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,540
career change that's so dramatic it

162
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,790
takes nerve because when you learn

163
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,430
anything new there's a lot of being

164
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,930
wrong and it's embarrassing and it's

165
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,360
hard especially if you've done something

166
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:19,420
else and been good at it so then go back

167
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,880
to the position of not being good at it

168
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,470
and just you know doing all the stuff

169
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,800
failing which is kind of the learning

170
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:30,550
process that's that's hard so the people

171
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,280
that you get coming in a brave committed

172
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,250
quite often taking it and a pay cut to

173
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,950
go to your new sector not always depends

174
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,300
what you're doing before but you know

175
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,190
say the same prices are their entrance

176
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,840
that's not unfortunately for people

177
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,480
coming in that's from the employers side

178
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,700
and people often don't don't really

179
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,320
change feels to stand still from my own

180
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,740
points of view having seen that so I was

181
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,840
able to change fields you realize I've

182
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,000
changed my life this was huge I wanted

183
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,760
to do it and I've done it so what am i

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,170
doing now so consequently you get

185
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,300
motivated people who are ready to do

186
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,790
something else also I know people

187
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,210
looking for more diversity in their

188
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,700
teams

189
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,560
if you think that IT is still really

190
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,510
quite right to mail if you look in that

191
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,340
if you're looking at pool you're going

192
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,700
to get more of the same so look at

193
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:24,070
something else at different sectors okay

194
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:25,659
so this is also for recruiters what can

195
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,060
we do right now this is all great thing

196
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,970
needs the problems we know what they are

197
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:33,520
how can we get people interested so my

198
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,840
first point is have a low risk path that

199
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,549
you can tell someone who expresses an

200
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,400
interest the path I follow to get here

201
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:42,969
in terms of the study was quite

202
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,130
low risk in terms of money in put into

203
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,870
it the time that I spent on it but it

204
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,580
was interesting so buddy it was one of

205
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,170
these things where nobody was watching

206
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,630
me I could put as much or as little into

207
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:55,479
it as I wanted and do it at my own pace

208
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:57,340
so this is kind of a low-risk entry

209
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,110
thing so I'm going to show you I'll put

210
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,510
my qualifications up on the last slide

211
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,340
that's a sex talk so you can just if you

212
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:07,840
if something interests you you can then

213
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:10,660
take a photo or whatever but here we've

214
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,980
got to open dates now I did have it I

215
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,120
think we should have open things so

216
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,380
people can see what we do and then it's

217
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,300
stricken with it I work in a secure

218
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,340
environment

219
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,849
you know keypad to back to education you

220
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:23,710
think yeah this is yeah so I'm not sure

221
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,360
quite how about that but maybe just go

222
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,470
on in there there's some people or if

223
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,840
you check them out for us I don't know

224
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,270
but that's a thought the other thing is

225
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,940
promotional material that explains what

226
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:36,189
what the job actually is how they fit

227
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,900
together and how you kind of work

228
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,970
through it in a kind of pathway to a

229
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,610
different career and this is the big one

230
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,110
for me make sure you're not putting

231
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,590
people off by asking for too much on the

232
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,240
job spec so there's a well quoted report

233
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,780
the fueler Packard reports that was in

234
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,940
Forbes in 2014 it's being referred to a

235
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,030
lot women are less likely to apply for a

236
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:01,330
job if they don't meet all the criteria

237
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:03,100
so if you know it's after that anybody

238
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:07,920
who's quite anxious because men can be

239
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:11,020
anxious too so if you want to widen your

240
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,020
pool of applicator applicants you know

241
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:16,390
don't make it too overwhelming if it's

242
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,910
an entry-level role if you're asking for

243
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,130
something like I don't know security

244
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,810
plus you could say fine or you know see

245
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,170
you I say plus these are things that I'm

246
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:28,089
looking at under I'm working towards the

247
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,170
some of them will say oh I think it's

248
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,960
about doing this after you've got three

249
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,250
years experience it's that catch-22 it

250
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,160
wasn't meant in the last talk you know

251
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:40,720
how do you get experience maybe what you

252
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:44,850
need is not a set of qualifications but

253
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,500
attributes for somebody to do the role

254
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,310
so what makes a good analyst because

255
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,370
this isn't this is my experience

256
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:55,279
defensive side when I came to the talk

257
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,680
it was by beside leaves the keynote was

258
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,540
by some heroes and she was standing at

259
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,430
the front telling how she German

260
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,379
implemented a whole kind of security

261
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:08,269
learning process as it engaged people

262
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:10,040
and they you know improved their level

263
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:13,040
of understanding and it's in a large

264
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:17,540
firm I think it was a law firm and she

265
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,759
was talking about how you got people to

266
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,309
engage with learning and how we get them

267
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,470
to to learn take things in and it struck

268
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:26,959
me as a former English teacher and from

269
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,600
a secondary school sitting at the back I

270
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,729
thought my experience is actually

271
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,350
relevant here I know all this I'm you

272
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,149
know I can I can I can do this I've got

273
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,730
something here that can be useful in

274
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:40,160
this career so this is some Bloom's

275
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,769
taxonomy of them so we've got here this

276
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,559
is kind of like the first lesson of

277
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:48,199
pedagogy in your PGCE you know different

278
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:49,490
orders of thinking so the idea is the

279
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:51,319
higher are the top three of the higher

280
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,029
order thinking skills now if you're

281
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:54,979
going to be an analyst in a sock for

282
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,930
example you need all of these so we've

283
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,819
got the knowledge level comprehension we

284
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,579
understand it more deeply I mean these

285
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:03,889
are broken down you can see apply it to

286
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:06,800
something see if that was good

287
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:09,019
and put it all together and develop your

288
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,029
own comment on that so these are all our

289
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,259
higher them or the thinking skills these

290
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:15,290
are things that we need to work with

291
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:16,850
analysts the other things ask my

292
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,860
colleagues some more senior colleagues

293
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,279
what actually makes a good analyst in

294
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,449
your experience so um the response I got

295
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,860
it's not about your level of knowledge

296
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:26,930
or experience it's about your ability to

297
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:30,079
gather information and cut through it to

298
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:32,719
the juicy important bits and technical

299
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,519
skills are great but more valuable it's

300
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,170
a sensible head for knowing how to

301
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,519
approach any problem from a position of

302
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,529
zero knowledge because we're all going

303
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,879
to be looking at new threats if you're

304
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:42,529
sitting in the top there's going to be a

305
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,149
zero dare you haven't seen before

306
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,639
that's replicating and you don't have to

307
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:49,779
do with it so you have to know how to

308
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:53,509
approach it even more than what it is

309
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:56,329
also we're a new industry if you can do

310
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:57,860
the part of working out your own path

311
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:59,599
plotting all this because this is not

312
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,170
something these are skills to have to

313
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,920
learn

314
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,240
and to get here float your own path you

315
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,860
know you decide your own syllabus what's

316
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,060
the stuff that you have to learn you

317
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,620
need to catch all that in how you can

318
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,750
fit that into your life make it all

319
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,110
happen by the time you've done that you

320
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,209
can tell your room would be employers

321
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,970
you have all these skills and it'll help

322
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:22,130
you carry on with your career so what do

323
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,870
you need to know to get a job this is

324
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,510
just that's a bit tongue-in-cheek

325
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:29,029
it's me saying this is what I did and

326
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,800
hopefully this will be useful to you so

327
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:32,089
as I say this will be up on the final

328
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,609
slide I know you can't see these

329
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:36,050
terribly well so don't worry about that

330
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,430
this I started off with this so much the

331
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,500
introduction to cybersecurity did it

332
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,089
through future learn I think to do it

333
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,120
with certifications about 40 or 50

334
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:46,160
pounds it assumes no prior knowledge if

335
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,600
you end up not going into security it

336
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,709
looks good on your CV anyway because

337
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,230
it's something everybody needs to be

338
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:54,199
aware of it's through the Open

339
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:57,709
University on futurelearn approved by

340
00:13:54,199 --> 00:14:00,439
GCHQ was a good introduction good

341
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:02,869
starting place next bit I'd say you need

342
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,269
to know how the network side of things

343
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,060
works so that you can fit it all

344
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:11,000
together so before you even buy anything

345
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:14,959
look at the OSI model and you know a bit

346
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,310
of Wikipedia and whatever and make it

347
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,199
all fit together and then I went to have

348
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,609
a look at the sea science which big book

349
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:24,290
thoughts you know about 40 pounds and

350
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:27,470
worthwhile to see how it starts from the

351
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:30,769
basics and works up now this is

352
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:34,329
absolutely my favorite this is a

353
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:36,100
Coursera course it's a specialization in

354
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:39,229
introduction to cybersecurity

355
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:43,510
specialization and it has four different

356
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,510
courses in it I'm quite keen on it

357
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:48,769
introduction to cybersecurity so it

358
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:50,899
hasn't it things like the first ones in

359
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:55,670
it you look through more module it talks

360
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:57,350
about the cybersecurity gen generally

361
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,349
this bits on cryptography and there's

362
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:03,079
stuff on there's a module called real

363
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:06,380
time cyber threat detection and

364
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,959
mitigation something about how you

365
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:13,089
secure enterprises and infrastructure

366
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,089
it's really a very good course and very

367
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,880
gently present it if you're feeling

368
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,490
nervous the guy that you know on there

369
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,439
all the videos or starts off hi there

370
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,860
folks I'm Adam arrow so and it's really

371
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,870
just like our thanks s you know a

372
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,480
feel-good thing so and then I just

373
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,190
topped it off with a bit of HTML because

374
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,500
again just on online course through

375
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:38,370
Coursera because I was trying to guess

376
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:41,460
what sort of thing might you want if I'm

377
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,930
looking at web traffic I'm going to need

378
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,170
to know what normal looks like before I

379
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:47,760
can detect anomalies so that's the plan

380
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:51,180
so how would you know you've done some

381
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,130
studying how would you get a job so be

382
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,250
parts of communities I got my job

383
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:58,680
through Twitter after having done some

384
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,470
urban studying I said I'm looking for it

385
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,839
you know an entry-level job in a sock

386
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,410
could you know if anybody knows of

387
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,520
anything and okay I think using

388
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:11,790
cameraman ever sit Portsmouth up limited

389
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:14,490
somewhere very far away from me I said

390
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:17,849
oh my company's got a stop near you send

391
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,320
me a CV and they did and hopefully then

392
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,720
the start of October you'll get some

393
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,210
money now because before with them on TV

394
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,530
to a tower and here we are so tell

395
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,880
people that you're looking and where

396
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,000
there's a lot of people say and looking

for job in a saucony awesome what what

398
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,870
you know where are you know like Texas

399
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:41,850
and less okay so say where DC 1 Phi 1 is

400
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:43,650
the least DC I would say anything you

401
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,120
can go to whether it's that kind of

402
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:51,140
thing where they have the talks or

403
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:53,670
whether it's CTF so have the box things

404
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:55,260
that's a really good thing to look just

405
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,780
cause you're building a community people

406
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,580
might say to you oh I'll mention you are

407

build your them things there if you're

410

411
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,629
something that you like remember to

412
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,580
tweet at the person even if they're

413
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,440
really impressive and thank them you

414
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,179

415
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,800
everything you know

416
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,080
lift your top six pretty much back you

417
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,790
know and then they simply might retweet

418
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,319
it and say you're very welcome or

419
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,930
something like that and also matically

420
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,129
you know you can see that the people

421
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,839
that like that you know you cannot

422
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,950
follow each other you building a

423
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,929
community in the interview itself I run

424
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,400
this past the shop manager that was very

425
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,770
stunning here is scary

426
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,440
doing this into my boss's boss much

427
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:44,960
scary so but he let me it's clicker so I

428
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,920
feel I'm getting some good advice so

429
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,110
don't try to black technical knowledge

430
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,690
in my interview I could talk about

431
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:55,409
three-way handshakes and you know this

432
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,700
is in the header for the for the syn

433
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,100
packet and it's not that mean at blah

434
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,720
blah blah but I couldn't tell you what

435
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,669
my port numbers were which I don't think

436
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,160
I could say I think I was asked what

437
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:08,250
what you find on port 443 and I was like

438
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,690
mmm so that kind of showed you you not

439
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,230
meant to be the full product I still got

440
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,410
the job

441
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,570
be ready to talk about but it can really

442
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,950
annoy people if you drag off oh yeah I

443
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:21,210
know that I'm just not telling you today

444
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:23,010
so be ready to talk about recent

445
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,610
security events so that shows your

446
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,660
commitment in you enthusiasm and what

447
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,070
does not manager actually said to me is

448
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,510
if somebody comes in they're really

449
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,909
enthusiastic you know for an entry-level

450
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:35,070
role I'm going to be hard-pressed not to

451
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,020
just give them the job because anything

452
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,600
that they don't already know they'll

453
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,260
learn because they care so in show your

454
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,760
enthusiasm you in a really good position

455
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,220
be ready to talk about recent stuff and

456
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,140
have researched the company so if you

457
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,900
can look at the website but maybe also

458
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,180
the if you look at the website but also

459
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,710
like things like a company report or

460
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,450
anything you can find if people look up

461
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,700
the people who are in serving you on

462
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,340
LinkedIn before you before you go you

463
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,650
know have researched a bit know the job

464
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,980
that you're applying for speak to HR

465
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:10,200
when you have that conversation before

466
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,240
before you get the interview ask what

467
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,740
exactly did I do is this you know be

468
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,840
ready to go in their last questions oh

469
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,370
and also and be friendly because they're

470
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,689
quite often there recruiting their

471
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,909
colleagues so if you can remember

472
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:24,130
through your nerves just like that

473
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,950
a positive thing so how do we live

474
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:29,080
happily ever after now so new starters

475
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,640
keep being who you were in the interview

476
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,129
because it's easy to go quiet

477
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,690
the difference between saying I'm here

478
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,300
I'm really excited I want to learn and

479
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:40,780
being in a room full of like 30 people

480
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:43,030
who know a lot more than you and you

481
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,500
know they're not necessarily being funny

482
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:47,139
about it they're just getting on with

483
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,580
their jobs which look really cool over

484
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,670
their shoulders and it's kind of

485
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,689
intimidating keep asking questions and

486
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:56,770
don't just kind of tell it on yourself

487
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,270
employers when you've got your new

488
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,129
starters if their career changes

489
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,500
particularly they might need a bit of

490
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,300
reassurance I got welcome letter from

491
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,030
the summer and you're saying you know

492
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:10,409
preaching brick see you exciting times

493
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:12,550
here you know see you in a week and oh

494
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,930
wow it made a big difference to me

495
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,879
starting if you can if can welcome

496
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:19,810
people like that and schedule time to

497
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,070
check in on them so you say okay instead

498
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,440
of I'll just catch up with you later in

499
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:26,260
the week say okay so I booked an

500
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,550
appointment in four 12.com Friday and we

501
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,730
can just have a run three way or up to

502
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:32,350
that makes you feel a lot more calm I

503
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,730
think as a new staff that you know when

504
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,379
you've got something you can actually

505
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:38,400
you know if something comes up there's

506
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:40,720
some time you can address it people and

507
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,510
invest in your colleagues if you can so

508
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,220
new starters try and make connections

509
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,170
within the firm if there's something

510
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,910
that you know you need to ask somebody

511
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,810
from a different team and you've seen

512
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,000
them you had a little chat in the

513
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:54,340
kitchen go okay it's specialist in the

514
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,950
kitchen you know or whatever that's a

515
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,990
positive thing employers for your career

516
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,730
changes if you have a uniform it's just

517
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,650
polo shirts or something have it ready

518
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,540
to go when they start when I started in

519
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,420
the sock I think you're feeling a bit

520
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,960
kind of Laura Ashley compared to my my

521
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:13,840
colleagues in hoodies and jeans so if

522
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,390
you can start you know that they might

523
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,830
not know what the standard is there so

524
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,040
give them a head start

525
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:23,050
keep up the study when you've learnt all

526
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,470
these skills to study by yourself

527
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:28,510
big push and if you can keep going it

528
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,669
increases your pain and your value in

529
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,129
the market

530
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:33,269
and employers in that case expect that

531
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:34,949
they won't necessarily stay in that

532
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:35,999
entry-level role for long because if

533
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:40,169
they've come this far they'll keep

534
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:42,479
pushing new starters big one monitor

535
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:45,029
yourself and be honest about your needs

536
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:48,929
because if you're not their normal

537
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:50,820
intake you might need some supports in

538
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:52,409
places they're not expecting they might

539
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,329
not just be denying you on purpose they

540
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:57,450
might just blow okay yeah sure we'll

541
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:59,099
help you with that and if you can do

542
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,769
that instead of just running away and

543
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:03,539
never coming back one day tell them give

544
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:06,389
them a chance and again therefore

545
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:09,059
employers expect the unexpected so you

546
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:10,918
again same thing you might be finding

547
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:16,139
things hard that you didn't know because

548
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:18,059
the more diversity in your workforce the

549
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:20,998
things will definitely change the feel

550
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:24,149
of my work and how it goes so here's

551
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:25,979
that final slide study resources in fact

552
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:27,958
if that's any use to I would say the

553
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:29,249
Coursera ones the great thing about it's

554
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:32,789
the one with all the hot Sun stars is

555
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:34,320
you can audit the lot for free you don't

556
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:38,249
you can't take the examples the

557
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,749
qualifications if you are not subscribed

558
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:44,279
the subscription is about 40 pounds a

559
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:46,469
month but you could learn everything you

560
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,700
know if you're ready to go and then just

561
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:48,809
pay for one month subscription and

562
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,690
hammer through the courses because you

563
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:53,519
can watch the full lot so there we go

564
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,649
I'll leave that up on the screen if

565
00:22:53,519 --> 00:23:06,479
anybody's got any questions it's time to

566
00:22:55,649 --> 00:23:13,168
mix imposter syndrome I'll tell you when

567
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:15,869
I went into it an exciting week these

568
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:17,839
are my kind of suggestions that have you

569
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:20,999
punched through it and I think for me

570
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,700
when I first got to the sock I was I was

571
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:26,159
struggling that a lot and people were

572
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,839
telling me things I was like you know I

573
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,700
understood what they were saying while

574
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,019
they were saying it and then Zagon and I

575
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,999
was just thinking honor so what I did

576
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:36,269
then as soon as I got there was I

577
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:40,859
studied for my Security+

578
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:43,139
and I took me in three weeks and then I

579
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:45,299
passed it and when I passed it I was

580
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:48,029
like okay maybe I just have to be here

581
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:49,080
so I would say like certifications even

582
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,849
it doesn't have to be the fanciest one

583
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,289
in the world make you feel like you're

584
00:23:50,849 --> 00:24:06,539
less of an impostor that's that work for

585
00:23:52,289 --> 00:24:08,339
me I think it's you know this is taxing

586
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:11,519
with something looking it's easy and

587
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:13,589
somebody said to me you get more fails

588
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,249
on the see science than you do people do

589
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:19,678
books courses and do this full CCNA

590
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:22,109
because doing something harder also

591
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,450
revises something easier so what I'd

592
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:26,158
suggest is there's a repetition that was

593
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,169
mentioned in our last course your than

594
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,879
isotope you've got to kind of keep

595
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:31,320
repeating it at regular intervals don't

596
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:31,859
feel ashamed about going back over old

597
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,479
ground

598
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:35,279
give yourself you know people eat it

599
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:36,690
yourself oh yeah look at me I'm revising

600
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:42,209
things I'm doing it Sarah Lakewood me

601
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:43,499
you know and if you do that and you

602
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:46,289
carry on with something harder even

603
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:47,459
though you can't 100% remember that will

604
00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:56,879
help you revise the easiest attitude

605
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:58,619
that's my experience it's got to fit in

606
00:24:56,879 --> 00:25:00,809
with your life so yeah I mean when I was

607
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:02,249
in there sitting in the sock I was there

608
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:03,418
all the time feeling really

609
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:04,829
self-conscious because all my colleagues

610
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,029
were there and I knew that everybody

611
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:07,739
could see me even if they weren't

612
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:08,789
looking particularly so I was like well

613
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:11,179
I've just got to crack on with this

614
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:13,259
study and I got really into just like

615
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:14,759
slamming it off of hate every day

616
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:16,649
and those the other thing is if you're

617
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:17,820
doing a lots of studying eat lots of

618
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:20,428
protein think about it like

619
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:25,708
weightlifting this is my advice you know

620
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:27,209
just eating it loads of chicken in the

621
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:28,829
afternoon let's put load of protein and

622
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:35,219
keep it keeping it yeah that's my best

623
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:38,049
advice how do you decide when you

624
00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:40,789
remembers anything

625
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:46,690
which the the entry-level session which

626
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:49,009
ones yes well I just finished my

627
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,710
security specialization and I thought

628
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:54,109
and also to be honest my husband's in

629
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:57,139
nineteen not security and you know he's

630
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:58,369
always been ya know so he suffer and his

631
00:25:57,139 --> 00:26:00,199
eyes be saying oh you're really good

632
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:02,139
it'll be fine don't worry and so and he

633
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,659
knows he does a lot of recruitment and

634
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:07,369
he sounds like yeah yeah go for it so I

635
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:08,479
had that extra help to get me into the

636
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:09,678
industry because otherwise I wouldn't

637
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:12,379
have been able to see the pattern in the

638
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,429
same way but he's like yeah you said you

639
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:14,539
know you've got a good head on your

640
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:18,710
shoulders go and apply for something

641
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:19,908
alone so that's why but I've just

642
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:30,470
finished the courses if you do that

643
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:31,639
start playing anything else oh yeah

644
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:35,059
totally

645
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:36,469
I mean I think I did that and that kind

646
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:38,359
of helped me understand what sort was

647
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,519
aside from anything else because I think

648
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:42,678
the last one the real-time cyberattack

649
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:45,889
detection and mitigation that covers

650
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:48,769
something and to do with the new actual

651
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:50,508
Sox and the guys talking about having

652
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:52,369
I've never I say there's telling about

653
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:54,830
how them you know they set them up in

654
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:57,109
the first place so that thing but if

655
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,668
that applied but after that I think the

656
00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:10,899
security plus and when you're doing it

657
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:14,119
every day that helps now I'm good and

658
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:16,369
excited so I'm I've got to for my target

659
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:18,049
to work I've got to do the CEO is a plus

660
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:20,238
by the end of the year and should be

661
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:23,509
going onto crest of next year I'm hoping

662
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:25,489
to become a senior analyst basically so

663
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:27,320
I came in level one analyst

664
00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:29,570
past my security process became circuits

665
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,099
at the level two analyst and the next

666
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,869
thing is that I'm aiming processing it

667
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:34,249
but I'm conscious that there's going to

668
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:37,810
be somebody else on in the minute so I

669
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:41,700
probably ought to go so thank you

670
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:41,700
