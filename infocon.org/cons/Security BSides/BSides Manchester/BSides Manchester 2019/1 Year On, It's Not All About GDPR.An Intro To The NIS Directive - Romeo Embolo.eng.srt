1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:14,860
okay hi everyone i'm romeo and I'll be

2
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:18,220
talking today about introduction to the

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:22,539
network information system directive an

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:24,820
iced tea and also we all know that

5
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:29,259
there's been a lot of birds about gdpr

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:32,168
but there was a silent one moving along

7
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:33,670
with GDP are called this directive and

8
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:38,319
that's the one I'm going to be talking

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:40,030
about today prior to doing that you know

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,809
it'll be the case of introducing myself

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:46,960
and also going through some case study

12
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:50,519
the aims of the directive and the

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:55,629
guidance that support that directive and

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:59,079
the toolkit that the NCSC develop and

15
00:00:55,629 --> 00:01:02,410
how we have customized it in in CGI and

16
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:09,070
also what it means for sector that are

17
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:11,460
concerned well CGS has at the plants we

18
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:17,970
are in know 40 country in more than 400

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:22,869
location our revenue is 1.5 billion and

20
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:27,180
also we've developed 175 IP solution now

21
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:31,119
and we are servicing basically 5000

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:36,549
cities and the same with our friend

23
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:38,579
teller swath so we went back to

24
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:42,430
university recently as a mature student

25
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:45,490
Cardiff University graduated with a BS

26
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,710
in information system and carried on

27
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:52,630
doing a master in information security

28
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:54,460
and privacy since then was engaged in

29
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,170
working with the Welsh government

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:01,479
assembly I don't know if you guys

31
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:03,850
remember the or hm I see CD you know

32
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,740
being lost and things like that at the

33
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,780
time the government decided to review

34
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,929
all the information assurance so I was

35
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,819
part of the audit team were basically

36
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,140
surveys that party to make sure that

37
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,358
they were complying with those new

38
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,059
directive and control that input put in

39
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:22,420
place I've also worked with financial

40
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:26,010
services insurance Admiral pretty

41
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:30,839
insurance the likes of at radius mainly

42
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:34,238
involved in GDP our readiness also

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,450
flirted a little bit with financial in

44
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,299
text our top developing being part of

45
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:44,048
development team to do with developing

46
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:47,230
messaging up to a true payment system

47
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:49,150
and and a socialite since the nine

48
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,268
months that that up joined CGI as a

49
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,180
cyber security consultant and at the

50
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:59,200
minute I'm walking in smart metering

51
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,939
program and I'm a PK administrator the

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,089
dealing with crypto system you know

53
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:06,668
issuing a digital certificate and the

54
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:10,930
searchlight when I'm not doing all of

55
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:13,180
these play brucha basketball and I'm

56
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,280
trying to see if I can run the London

57
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,989
Marathon but that's not that's quite a

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:23,459
big deal for me I don't actually know if

59
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:26,639
um when do that is quite hard okay now

60
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:30,870
before I start I like us to go through

61
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:35,139
like your help there through a scenario

62
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:38,439
let's say there's a power outage in

63
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:41,139
London for next eight two hours in one

64
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,680
of the train station can you possibly

65
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:58,829
give me Distin area that could occur

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:04:01,689
anything that you can think of yeah so

67
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:04,870
is be overactive in this final sonic

68
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:08,078
word yeah so this reception services

69
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:16,959
people are stranded and what else could

70
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:18,410
think of actually assaulted okay and

71
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,660
also yeah that

72
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,400
that's one thing what about no police

73
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,730
being sent because there will be a chaos

74
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,919
people wanting to go in other part of

75
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,810
the country and all those different

76
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,600
system being connected that's going to

77
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:37,460
be a massive kind of like disruption so

78
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:42,890
basically this actually happened the

79
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:45,919
beginning of the month and in a matter

80
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:49,580
of two hours about a million people were

81
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:53,570
affected by power a page that only

82
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,510
lasted two hours and it was a thin cross

83
00:04:53,570 --> 00:05:00,110
station services there you know God can

84
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:02,480
counsel and it even affected if switch

85
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,200
hospital because they had a backup

86
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,900
generator that couldn't they couldn't

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,659
basically make him function and for

88
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,419
about thirty minutes they they run out

89
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,070
of power imagine if they were carrying

90
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,470
out operations there and things like

91
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:23,180
that what will happen people you know

92
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:25,090
when not being able to to join to make

93
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,940
phone call you know any things like that

94
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:32,179
they said they were problem with power

95
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,980
power station it wasn't a cyberattack

96
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,670
but he could have well been a

97
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,960
cyberattack

98
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,430
and that would have been you know kind

99
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,190
of the scenario that could have happened

100
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:46,090
had it died I didn't I had it occur like

101
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:49,580
that so on the more factual basis the

102
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:55,940
coverage and center Forrester the carry

103
00:05:49,580 --> 00:06:00,260
out model some cost that could generate

104
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:05,030
the derive as a result of sophisticated

105
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:08,330
attack and it was basically resulted it

106
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:11,150
there was this impact you would have

107
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:15,340
impact between nine and thirteen million

108
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:19,159
household those would have lost

109
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:22,460
electricity and also disruption around

110
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,630
the same amount of people would have you

111
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,669
know you would have affected

112
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,310
transportation jitter communication and

113
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:34,090
water services and in terms of the month

114
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:39,100
the lost out of course between 11.6 and

115
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:42,789
eighty five point five billion and over

116
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:45,520
the next five years the GDP the GDP

117
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:48,430
would have been affected around forty

118
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,409
nine billion to four hundred forty two

119
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:54,340
billion so I don't know if you guys

120
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:56,890
remember also in 2017

121
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:01,840
it was the one crying somewhere

122
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:05,340
phenomenom okay although people didn't

123
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,409
die but that affected a lot of people

124
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,020
NHS the twenty-sixth trusts were

125
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:14,380
affected out of the twenty six we had 81

126
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:18,390
that were affected and so does scenario

127
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:21,250
is basically to let you know how with

128
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:24,090
technology evolving now the threat

129
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:27,690
landscape as well is evolving we have

130
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:32,080
computing the to pervasive in

131
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:34,030
information IOT been increasing so the

132
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,169
the landscape is really increasing and

133
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:41,039
as we know legislation always play

134
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:45,190
catch-up so if it was the case then for

135
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:50,620
the EU member state to try to come up

136
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:52,719
with a strategy to to basically provide

137
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,390
like a move the legal measure to ensure

138
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,880
that the overall level of security was

139
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:05,010
basically managed within the EU so it

140
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:07,540
was the case of setting up computer

141
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,070
system response and Incident Response

142
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,260
approach those nation

143
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:15,040
it was the case of improving

144
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:17,680
communication making sure that the

145
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,530
culture of cybersecurity was kind of

146
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,440
like spread across member state it was

147
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:25,809
also the case of making sure that they

148
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,440
can put some sort of best practice and

149
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:33,130
information took it that those member

150
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:37,780
would be able to to derive all different

151
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:40,779
control from that and so they identified

152
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,389
the different different vital sector

153
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:47,589
that we can see their digital services

154
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:51,060
energy have transport banking digital

155
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:54,639
infrastructure financial market and

156
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:57,339
basically water as well so those

157
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,259
different sector here in the UK are

158
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:02,699
actually part of the critical national

159
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:07,600
infrastructure and so in term of scoping

160
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:10,660
the NASD it covers the vast majority of

161
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,990
those sector apart from banking and

162
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,439
financial services that are already

163
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:20,829
regulated they or they have their own

164
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:24,248
legislative of framework so when we

165
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:26,559
speak about we talk about in this

166
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:29,920
directive there are three main

167
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:33,269
stakeholders or a component that we need

168
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,209
to bear in mind we have what we call

169
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:40,149
operator of essential services and those

170
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:44,138
are basically organization that provides

171
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:46,689
an essential services that to do with

172
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:48,639
our daily life and that can have a

173
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:52,500
massive impact as well on the economy

174
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,939
and also based on the fact that the

175
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,309
network and information system is

176
00:09:54,939 --> 00:10:03,250
concern any disruption to that will the

177
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:08,680
very will really disturb the whole whole

178
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:10,930
dual setting so the mist-covered aspect

179
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,680
as well and we didn't it we also have

180
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:17,769
digital service provider the likes of

181
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,680
search engine online like a place and

182
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:23,529
then throughout service provider okay

183
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:28,508
thing with the directive is you know it

184
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:32,050
covers organizations that have more than

185
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:36,809
50 employees and with the turnover of

186
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:40,149
more than 10 million so those different

187
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:42,939
the needs as well make sure that there

188
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:46,029
is there are competent authority within

189
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:48,870
the Member State that are responsible

190
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:51,720
for making sure that

191
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:56,340
the organization comply with with the

192
00:10:51,720 --> 00:11:00,410
directive in the case of nice it's

193
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:03,210
actually you have sector-specific

194
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,670
competent authorities so if we take what

195
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:09,660
you have a competent authority that is

196
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:12,180
related to water so all operator of

197
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,660
essential services their sector specific

198
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,969
but digital service provider the

199
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:25,709
competent authority there is the ICU as

200
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:29,100
well yeah so okay so I talked about the

201
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:34,640
toolkit and best practice that each

202
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:38,700
member state would develop so the NCSC

203
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:42,540
develop a framework which is basically

204
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,580
an audit auditing tool and for 1200

205
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:48,420
ization - money better manage the

206
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:51,150
cybersecurity - risk in relation to the

207
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,819
operator of essential services the

208
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,100
directive itself come to force as I

209
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:03,839
mentioned earlier almost at the same

210
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:06,380
comes at GDP I may 2018 so so how what's

211
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,330
the structure of the world framework

212
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:12,600
it's divided in basically four main

213
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:14,940
objective managing the race protecting

214
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,160
against cyber attack detecting cyber

215
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,450
incident and minimizing the impact of

216
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:24,780
cyber incident so true underneath those

217
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:29,400
different objective you have 14

218
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:32,569
principle those 14 principle and on the

219
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:37,140
line by what we call indicator of good

220
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:40,080
practice so each objective principle of

221
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:43,050
indicator of which is basically a

222
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,080
statement declarative statement by which

223
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:49,319
that needed to be abide - in terms of

224
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,050
making sure that that specific objective

225
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,300
is still is being complied - and you

226
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,930
have the three degree of rating not

227
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:01,589
achieved partially achieve and also

228
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:07,290
achieve itself so and those different

229
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:11,040
indicator of good practice you have in

230
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:13,530
39 individual assessment that you would

231
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:19,640
basically rate those objectives against

232
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:21,720
so how those are basically prescriptive

233
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,970
depending on the nature of the

234
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,740
organization and the specificity of the

235
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,870
organization is the case of really

236
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,050
making sure how you can customize this

237
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,580
and then make it work for yourself or

238
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,140
for your organization or your

239
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:39,840
organization that you're trying to

240
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:42,060
assess so also with in CGI so before I

241
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:45,240
was talking about you know how we do it

242
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:48,540
in CGI this is an example of indicator

243
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,700
of good part of good practice so you

244
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,120
have the principal there secure

245
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:57,150
configuration and then followed by the

246
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,040
whole indicator of good practice and you

247
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:02,670
have the different statement that need

248
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,730
to be filled or and control that you

249
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:12,390
need to follow to to basically complete

250
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:14,820
that indicator of good practice so so

251
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,460
how did we do we so basically what we

252
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:24,600
did is to take the 14 principal line

253
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:27,180
them up within those principal we came

254
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,400
up with other component for example if

255
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,439
we take governance we will do governance

256
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,959
will have three component both

257
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:39,360
directions role and responsibility and

258
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:44,550
decision making we developed we expand

259
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:50,700
on the remains to the the tuff framework

260
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:53,849
by adding extra statement day we

261
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:57,960
classify them in terms of degree of

262
00:14:53,850 --> 00:15:00,630
maturity and those degree of maturity we

263
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,270
mark them in terms of percentages so you

264
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:06,210
will have zero percent ten percent 40

265
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:10,030
percent 70 up to 100% and then scoring

266
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:12,820
and so those would be you

267
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:15,370
develop the control but that's why we

268
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,820
have cyber assessment framework or the

269
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:20,560
test so you would line up all your

270
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,960
inquiries there or your examining

271
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,540
examining document and the searchlight

272
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:29,140
and basically you you will result into

273
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:31,920
them so different I did not include the

274
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,300
controls here because his internal

275
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,490
sensitive but you'll have a lot of

276
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,609
control indicators that need to be

277
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:42,580
fulfilled so what you do is okay let's

278
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:47,590
say you take in this specific outbreak

279
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:50,590
governance and we say it roll 40% you

280
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:52,720
will put across there and then you fill

281
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:55,450
all of those in terms of which are what

282
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,800
level the organization is and what it

283
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:02,380
gives is basically each principal would

284
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,829
tell you where they are in their

285
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:10,120
compliance and this is only a snapshot

286
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:13,030
you have is a very long spreadsheet and

287
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,780
you will give you at the end this spider

288
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:18,130
diagram despite the diagram basically

289
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,520
allows you to start the conversation

290
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:24,939
with either your internal client or if

291
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:27,850
you are consulting from your client so

292
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:30,430
and the different aspect of it gives you

293
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,589
really the rating and you can basically

294
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,020
tell to the client okay this is you know

295
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:39,420
in a snapshot where you are and what

296
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:44,500
direction should we be going towards to

297
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:47,829
so this we actually and we have an

298
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:52,660
internal tool in CGI called iris so

299
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:55,510
where previously the spreadsheet will we

300
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,180
integrate it within our database which

301
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:00,000
basically means that okay with all the

302
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,380
control data already there so

303
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,109
integrating this within our database

304
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:08,470
allow us to basically run the risk

305
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:11,050
assessment if is to do with the operator

306
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,209
of essential services you will have all

307
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:16,079
those output straightaway when may you

308
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:21,089
carry out your your discuss as well so

309
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:23,409
so the challenge is then would be

310
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,990
definitely they will they need to

311
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,640
the business change program there will

312
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,040
be challenges in terms of those

313
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,190
different sector that we already manage

314
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,690
we mentioned earlier organization that

315
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,000
are working with the government are

316
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,490
really concerned people who are doing

317
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,780
cloud computing offering you know shared

318
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:45,670
services so your incident notification

319
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:48,850
will really really need to be looking to

320
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:51,130
same with reporting it and also trying

321
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,169
you know how do you now and the great it

322
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,570
between you know within your business

323
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:58,270
continuity plan of course the option

324
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:01,060
first of all you need secondly due to

325
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:03,910
your risk assessment you've got to go in

326
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:07,389
to fine-tune your your notification and

327
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:11,020
within 72 hours because the this is 72

328
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:14,110
hours and you have to adjust it and you

329
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,990
have to report it to the NCIC this is

330
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:19,990
not a competent authority they're just

331
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,520
acting as a incident response team so

332
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,850
they will certainly be giving you

333
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,550
guidance there and aligning all of those

334
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,840
dragging them in social the way that

335
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:32,440
that can be aligned with your business

336
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,990
continue to measure what I declared will

337
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,030
declare benefit to that you are

338
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,520
compliant not only are you compliant to

339
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:42,430
Denise but in vast majority of cases

340
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,740
that align your compliance to gdpr as

341
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:47,380
well you will increase your business

342
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,510
activity you'll have new business

343
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:53,440
opportunity when in terms of bidding and

344
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:55,120
you'll develop expertise as well not to

345
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:01,840
mention that will give you a competitive

346
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:05,469
advantage you will avoid penalties is 17

347
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,199
up to 17 million that's do little

348
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,910
difference with GDP are first of all

349
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,370
when this came out the government was

350
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:15,010
thinking of aligning it as well along

351
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:16,709
the line of GDP uh but they said you

352
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:20,080
know when there was that consultation

353
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:23,520
they decided to keep it to up to 17

354
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:27,340
million yeah so that's pretty much it

355
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,730
that's me done I hope you make a little

356
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:34,169
bit of sense to you guys and welcome any

357
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,170
questions yep

358
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:46,530
ten employees we provide infrastructure

359
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:48,890
service in scope I think the government

360
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:58,649
so far there in the slide here

361
00:19:48,890 --> 00:20:02,820
the government yeah if you got NCSC

362
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:05,490
website because this is since November

363
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:12,300
2018 I think the government was meant to

364
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:14,010
publish a list so they were 129 company

365
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,620
that were listed so it's the case of

366
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:21,810
trying to get in touch either with NSS

367
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:31,580
yes your eyes i co2 have more clarity on

368
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:34,050
that what I know is the information got

369
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,659
circulated in terms of the organization

370
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:39,540
that were basically deemed to be

371
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:47,580
eligible or fall under the criteria so

372
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:50,460
yeah we know just so you know just of

373
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:52,649
the DSP - okay so who gives you such a

374
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,590
framework because it's all aligned as I

375
00:20:52,650 --> 00:21:02,660
have established yeah yeah this is

376
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:02,659
heavily aligned to ISO 27000 yeah

377
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:16,770
something else okay

378
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:19,950
that's me done if my email address there

379
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,510
if you need more clarification in terms

380
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,850
of everything to do if the nest

381
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:29,160
