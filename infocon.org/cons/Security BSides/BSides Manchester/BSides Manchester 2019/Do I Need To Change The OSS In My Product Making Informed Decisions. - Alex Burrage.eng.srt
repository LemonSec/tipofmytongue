1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,690
yeah so this is the last talk on this

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,679
trip today

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,209
so they've told me that I can talk for

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:15,969
as long as I want so you guys are like a

5
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:19,090
3-hour talk so no we talked about OSS

6
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:22,480
and managing OSS in products that have

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:24,070
already been released so I'm a security

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,949
incident response engineer for

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,380
blackberry I've also been a software

10
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:31,359
developer and they systems architect so

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,129
I kind of seen all of the different

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,070
parts of managing OSS putting into

13
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:38,110
products deciding what goes in what I do

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,579
at the moment is where my team is

15
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,800
responsible for maintaining the security

16
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:43,149
of blackberry products so right before

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,640
us it's already out there in the market

18
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:48,340
we want to keep those to go and keep

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,350
those up to date what that practically

20
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,910
means is that I spend my time looking at

21
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,980
OSS libraries and the vulnerabilities

22
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,599
analysis like these so these are the

23
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,190
ones I've looked at in the last month or

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,429
so and that's because I ran out of space

25
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:04,179
on the slide but yeah so it means like a

26
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:06,549
huge amount of visibility into OSS

27
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,220
libraries which ones which ones are bad

28
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:11,009
what makes them good me bad and so

29
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,630
hopefully what I'm gonna do today is

30
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,950
help you guys to make products that are

31
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,259
more secure so I have to do less work

32
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,840
keeping them secure so you can put good

33
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:21,070
code into your products and then you

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,049
have to do less work keeping them up

35
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:29,850
today so there's not really any

36
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:31,810
technical details in this talk so

37
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,020
hopefully everyone can get something out

38
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,759
there if you use RSS if you develop - s

39
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,090
hopefully you can get some idea of what

40
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,740
your users are looking for it can

41
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,570
hopefully reduce your risk reduce the

42
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,679
cost of your company like I think

43
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:49,869
everyone can get something out of this

44
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,399
cool so where are we today these are

45
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,840
some stats I pulled off the internet as

46
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,430
always all starts on the internet have a

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,009
pulse but hopefully this gives you some

48
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,649
idea so this was the first one was a

49
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,090
black duck scan this is all the things

50
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:04,049
that they scanned there were an average

51
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:07,860
of 250 seven separate RSS components

52
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:11,290
which to me is huge number to manage and

53
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,380
the use of OSS is going up not going

54
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,570
down this is

55
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,980
well be living now and I want a big

56
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,510
disclaimer upfront I think oh it says

57
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,640
it's a good thing I'm not here to bash

58
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,380
it you know the world wouldn't work

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,750
without it I think it's great it allows

60
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,250
us to make better code hopefully we can

61
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,480
use it better than we are doing in the

62
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,920
moment but so I don't want to give

63
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:36,420
anything on the impression that Isis is

64
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:37,739
bad unless it does that policy so and

65
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,679
just to make sure we're all on the same

66
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,410
page what I mean when I talk about open

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:53,760
source is the source code is made

68
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:55,710
possible either of the cable yeah I'm

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,410
not going to talk about like if it has

70
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,030
to be free well what licensing model

71
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,650
they have to use like I'm just going to

72
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,790
ignore all that so we're gonna say that

73
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,180
anything where the source code is made

74
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:09,030
public catch and what that means is that

75
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,070
the security risk to all our companies

76
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,800
or products that we're making is

77
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,420
different that it would be in the olden

78
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,600
days using the traditional model or

79
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,519
floats or steamboats and what I mean

80
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,170
today but if we convince you guys off is

81
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,870
that our decision-making hasn't caught

82
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,010
we're still lagging behind the use of us

83
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,770
off that's why developers are doing

84
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:33,359
things but we're not keeping up with so

85
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,780
open source so what public I said the

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,150
source code is public actually in pretty

87
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,070
much every case there bug tracking

88
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,500
systems on topic as well so anyone

89
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,290
blocked an issue against a library you

90
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,830
can go and look at that it's usually on

91
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,980
github

92
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,360
some companies were on their own bug

93
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,100
tracking things but a lot of them use

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,170
github you can go and see what issues

95
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,540
have been logged and when issues haven't

96
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,339
been fixed you can go and look at the

97
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,470
old bucks you can see what fixes they

98
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,050
did develop you can see what tests were

99
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,459
on or get keeping the walls or reduction

100
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,350
tests there were all of that information

101
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,610
is public on the internet anyone can go

102
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:13,079
read it so what does that mean well it

103
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,030
means that your headache is public if

104
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,620
you're using this code all the

105
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,750
information out that is out there in the

106
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,920
world so anyone trying to attack your

107
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,260
product have so much more information

108
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,790
than they would have done before

109
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,480
probably is a great example of that if

110
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,900
you were if you want to see

111
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,310
in fact amusing non-secure RIFs you

112
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,799
understand up the server that uses an

113
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,270
unpatched version or open SSL and see

114
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,070
how long they take somebody's at it and

115
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,359
you'll be counting in minutes not hours

116
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,040
because people are just scanning

117
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,090
internet because all the information

118
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,490
about properly this out there

119
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:46,770
this isn't open SSL vault I'm not here

120
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:50,170
to bust open SSL that's just how we work

121
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,210
so it's all bugs as I say we have a huge

122
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,490
amount more information about the OSS

123
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,620
library we can look at the history we

124
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,200
can look at their previous fixes we have

125
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,150
access to their development life cycles

126
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,380
we can see what developers are working

127
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,659
on and see what their future versions

128
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,340
they have in development you know we can

129
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,310
read their code we can decide which

130
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,080
functions we want to use so we have all

131
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,210
of this extra information as I say all

132
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,400
of this is just out there publicly and

133
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,859
what this means is that we can make

134
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,289
informed decisions and also we are doing

135
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,880
I'm saying we can do and we should be

136
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:27,490
making more important decisions with the

137
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:29,590
information we have so the kind of the

138
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,970
point that my talk today is that is to

139
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:35,440
answer is to help us make a decision and

140
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,970
to get to the point what we're just

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,500
talking about the same thing I'm going

142
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,330
to make a bunch of assumptions so I'm

143
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,500
going to assume we know what OSS is in

144
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:46,240
our in our products that maybe not

145
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,410
completely realistic if anyone does know

146
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,630
every single bit of software that

147
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,640
they're using only surprise but for the

148
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,100
sake of argument we'll just or say we

149
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,919
know what we're using and what version

150
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,100
we're using which is again not realistic

151
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,420
and it's non-trivial to find out out of

152
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,640
the same value we know what you're using

153
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,400
we know what version it is so like we're

154
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,039
still supported don't use on supporting

155
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,140
loggers and that we have today for if

156
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,970
we're not today we have a good reason

157
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,349
for not being up today we know that the

158
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,600
version we're using has vulnerabilities

159
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:20,440
that don't affect us or you know we're

160
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,240
planning to do an update to whatever we

161
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,920
are happy with the version that we use

162
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,620
so once you've done all of those things

163
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,660
once you're using software which is

164
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,550
still supported and it's up to date or

165
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,690
as of today it's practical then what

166
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,910
else can we do

167
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,230
well how about putting the only thing

168
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,020
you can do to reduce

169
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:40,240
to your company or your project is to

170
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,830
replace your access so take the excess

171
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,740
likely that you're using find a

172
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:48,700
different one which gives you less risk

173
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,110
and then replace it if anyone knows

174
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,310
anything else you can do other than

175
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,720
keeping your libraries up to date and

176
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,390
replacing them with relaxed risky ones

177
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,930
he's come and tell me because as far as

178
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:01,180
I know this is the only thing you can do

179
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:03,130
hmm so if we're going to talk about the

180
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,090
placing access you might be seeing that

181
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,030
thinking well that isn't realistic

182
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,729
nobody's actually going to do that but

183
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,020
that's not true or at least all the

184
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,790
situations that I've seen that's not

185
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,210
true people make this decision all the

186
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,010
time

187
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,539
they might not you know have a meeting

188
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,800
sit down what the documents say we're

189
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,780
not replacing our library for this

190
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,000
reason but that doesn't mean they're not

191
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,909
making this decision and usually they're

192
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,830
going oh it's too much or are the the

193
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,830
security benefit I'm going to get from

194
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,210
that it's not enough ooh how do they

195
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,349
know that how to project managers know

196
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,909
that how are they making this decision

197
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,460
well they're going on gut instincts

198
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,560
they're saying you know I we did this

199
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,200
before and it wasn't worth it so I'm not

200
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,810
gonna doing it but as I've said with no

201
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,190
access we have a huge amount of data we

202
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:51,310
should be using methods that we should

203
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:53,710
be making informed decisions so before I

204
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,480
go all need to kind of the bulk of the

205
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,729
talk there are a bunch of tools out

206
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,010
there that help none of them give you

207
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,810
the whole picture and so kind of what

208
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,099
I'm talking about today is pulling whole

209
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,470
bunch of information together but these

210
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,920
will help if you want to talk to me

211
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,840
about any of these any of these tools in

212
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,480
particular like come grab me afterwards

213
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,130
I'm happy to talk about them but for the

214
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,140
sake of completeness here are some

215
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:21,909
things that help but none of them give

216
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:23,110
you the whole picture so what are the

217
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,400
factors that we want to take into

218
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,170
account so say we want to get gather

219
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,060
data what data do we want to gather so

220
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:36,039
if you're looking at a library a good

221
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,599
way or assessing insecurity risk is what

222
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,880
honor abilities has it had will see

223
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,700
visas out so we'll see these as it had

224
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,400
in the past how many does it have today

225
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,779
which it hasn't passed yet how severe

226
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,300
were they what

227
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:52,449
issues where they all this information

228
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,589
is out there it is public you can there

229
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:57,699
are tools that will grab this all

230
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:59,259
together for you so this one plots the

231
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:02,319
number of other parenthesis per year and

232
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:04,209
it's a twenty BFF school so you know you

233
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:05,620
can see that all the last few years the

234
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:07,599
number of quality of these has gone down

235
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,769
maybe that you know gives you some

236
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,910
confidence about the quality of the

237
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:12,459
library

238
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,459
on average the cbss school was glad to

239
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:17,949
know about a poly again maybe that's

240
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:21,638
okay so you can use this information to

241
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:23,319
say well this libraries you know is not

242
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,259
as risky as some other ones so maybe

243
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:28,959
that's not too bad you can also look at

244
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:30,850
how quickly the issues are fixed so as I

245
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,709
said we have at least read the bunch

246
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,540
wrapped industry so we can see when an

247
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:36,399
issue was raised when a security

248
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,170
researcher when a pen sets became a long

249
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,999
moment but here is my POC for this

250
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,680
vulnerability and then you can see how

251
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:45,490
long it was before the fix was in

252
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,939
production and you know if a library

253
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:51,040
consistently takes six months to do that

254
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:52,449
any zero days that let me guess that you

255
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,709
get because you were using that library

256
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:55,599
they're going to be around for six

257
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:58,209
months maybe that's not very few

258
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,279
duration so we can take all this

259
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:04,479
information into account and we can get

260
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,980
an idea of the help of the library so we

261
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,350
have one the manatees the thing that

262
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,019
comes along with ability is a patch so

263
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,120
we can see the commit history for a

264
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:16,149
library obviously they're not all going

265
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,860
to be security commits but we can pick

266
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:21,129
out the ones that are relevant for the

267
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,529
information that we need and this gives

268
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:27,040
us a lot of information about the health

269
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:28,899
of the project so you know all the

270
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,219
security fixes that again checked in are

271
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:31,839
they the kind of simple things that we

272
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,429
would have expected to have been done

273
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,439
already like are they just putting in

274
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:37,420
null pointer checks before dereference

275
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:39,129
it pointers or are they you know just

276
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,839
checking for the integer overflows they

277
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,670
doing that kind of basic level that we

278
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:45,819
would assume a mature library would have

279
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:47,378
found all those bugs like they're all on

280
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:49,809
the other sides you know if the patches

281
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:52,269
that are going in and capturing weird

282
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:54,589
obscure corner cases or race conditions

283
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:56,360
or you know those hard to find

284
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,590
then we go okay this is the kind of

285
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,330
thing that's getting back it probably

286
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,670
called the low-hanging fruit

287
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:05,990
this is a mature stable library that we

288
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:07,699
can trust because we have the patches we

289
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,080
can see all the source tree we can see

290
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:14,330
which directories which features a

291
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,620
getting patched and those might be the

292
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,510
features that we're not using so like

293
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,430
before the security stuff all the

294
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,930
patches that are going in and you know

295
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,339
the feature that we don't use the whole

296
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,930
pirate tree that we don't use for that

297
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:27,529
we can say that doesn't affect us that's

298
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:30,920
good we can see what regression testing

299
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:32,570
is done while gatekeeping there is the

300
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,010
last point I put on this slide is time

301
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,350
is about backporting I think this is

302
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,850
really important if but library develops

303
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,890
patches and they're not able to back

304
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,270
port it to their older versions that

305
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,120
gives me a lot that makes me very

306
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,520
nervous about that library and they you

307
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,320
know is their coach or coach and so fast

308
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,910
that they can't back for things because

309
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,950
the code is so different that's

310
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,160
generally not a very mature library

311
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,240
there are some good reasons sometimes

312
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,250
but generally if the library's changing

313
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,440
that past that makes me as a user

314
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:04,100
nervous like the state of our library in

315
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,300
general if things are being backported

316
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,560
you know they have the developer

317
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,810
resources they're putting the tiny

318
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,699
audacity fixing things that makes me a

319
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:17,000
lot happier so I visited a couple of

320
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:19,040
slides about code reviews art Kohn we've

321
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,780
done like when people make check-ins is

322
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,120
there a gatekeeping system do they have

323
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,160
to be plus formed what regression tests

324
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,690
are there you know do you have to check

325
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,000
in a unit test when you check these some

326
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:30,260
new code does that do you have to have a

327
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,680
certain level of code coverage before

328
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:36,710
it's accepted you know all these kind of

329
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,390
gatekeeping code use give us an idea of

330
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:42,530
the quality of the librarian of the

331
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:44,120
majority of that library you know how

332
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,589
many developers have to look at a piece

333
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,750
of code before it goes into production

334
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:50,890
and is it your cup because you're using

335
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:53,720
this like if that's just one person

336
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,490
that's you know gonna make me feel not

337
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,560
very happy if there's a proper

338
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,910
regression test you know if it has to be

339
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,469
peer reviewed all that kind of stuff

340
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,199
it's going to give us a lot more

341
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:06,080
confidence so all of these things are

342
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,580
going into contributing to our

343
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,580
impression of the health of the library

344
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,880
so as I said before we have we have all

345
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,520
the check-in history so we can see which

346
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,370
users or which developers are checking

347
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,980
in code we get an idea of the size of

348
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,810
the team so you know is this team is

349
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,550
this OSS library that I just found and

350
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,140
get help is it just one guy you know

351
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,370
SanDisk average making a product or is

352
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,830
there something that has a proper team

353
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,420
of developers working on it and it's

354
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,850
gonna be you know well supported going

355
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:41,990
forwards more eyes on home generally

356
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,190
means less issues but you know we're not

357
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,530
just gonna count the number of

358
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,510
developers we want to look at which

359
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:49,339
developers are making significant

360
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,720
regular contributions just because you

361
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,610
have ten different people who have made

362
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,300
the check in doesn't mean little what

363
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:58,370
you want the same amount feature is a

364
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,069
big one there so sometimes with some

365
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,560
smaller effects you might have a large

366
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,510
development team but in reality each

367
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,579
developer is just working on in their

368
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:12,439
own sandbox who's working on their own

369
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:14,330
feature and so in reality nobody else is

370
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,950
looking at that code is there the person

371
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,480
that does that bit and if there's a

372
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,970
vulnerability pair the person's get a

373
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,130
fix it so you have a potential bottle

374
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,410
may bear on you getting fixed because

375
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:27,380
the essentially warned about it but you

376
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,400
can develop that things for you so you

377
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,980
know just because they have a lot of

378
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,590
steam doesn't mean actually they're all

379
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:36,820
working across across the codebase and

380
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,820
they're all up in each other's code

381
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,140
documentation everyone hex documentation

382
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,150
they're working for a team documentation

383
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:48,560
but what a lot of really documentation

384
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:51,199
right and what I'm going to say is code

385
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,780
OSS libraries that are well documented

386
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,820
generally haven't been well plans have

387
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:59,030
enough developer resources on very

388
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,680
mature maybe you're gonna make this feel

389
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,189
worried about the security risks they're

390
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:07,130
going to introduce so you know I found

391
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,360
this was an article I read some of you

392
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,770
might be familiar with it but basically

393
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,110
you know it tells you how to integrate

394
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,160
it on each of these ten different

395
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,370
environments and there are probably

396
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,719
detailed step-by-step instructions if

397
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,760
somebody's gone to the effort of doing

398
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,590
that you know they're properly looking

399
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,569
after their

400
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,280
they have popular developer time to do

401
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,560
that kind of thing it's not exciting

402
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,390
it's not you know it's not sexy so why

403
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,880
they're going to develop but if they're

404
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,410
doing that I'm feeling a lot more happy

405
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,880
about the code that they're writing for

406
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:39,500
me I'm not saying that's the only way to

407
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,550
do with documentation I'm not here to

408
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,100
talk about what councilors good

409
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:48,290
documentation like it's a whole separate

410
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:51,350
topic but in general I think we've all

411
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,990
seen good and bad examples for brick so

412
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,150
you know the amount of effort those

413
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,890
points of the documentation gives me a

414
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:01,240
sense of the amount of effort people are

415
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:03,680
putting into making their livelihood and

416
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:07,240
that's going to make me happier about

417
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:10,310
the security risk that I'm taking on

418
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,780
release history so we can see how

419
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,229
frequent releases have been in the past

420
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:18,020
and we care about security you know we

421
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,790
can look at do they do security point

422
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,650
fixes or do they just wait for the next

423
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,650
major release in six months or a year

424
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,970
and then hold in a whole bunch of sugar

425
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,860
it's and fixes when they get there and

426
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,350
therefore even though they might have

427
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,260
converted the pigs I am in production

428
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,310
until the incremental version comes out

429
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,069
that's a problem for me as a user

430
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:39,560
because I'm saying they're using known

431
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:43,310
vulnerable code until they do their next

432
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:47,089
major release future roadmap is also

433
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,979
another good one if I know that this

434
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:52,100
library has like two or three future

435
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,480
versions planned ahead the development

436
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,460
team is doing some planning they have

437
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,560
plans to support the library for at

438
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,960
least two more versions why but that

439
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:03,560
might be six months a year the library

440
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:07,310
is less likely to go out of support so

441
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,899
that's going to make me feel happier so

442
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,990
as I say all this information is out

443
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:16,070
there I can use this to build up on my

444
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:18,319
picture of how good the libraries so

445
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,810
this using my code this is probably the

446
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,280
hardest thing to quantify and what we're

447
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,409
trying to do here is answered two

448
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,359
different questions

449
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,940
how are we to be affected by one

450
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:32,270
abilities and how hard is it going to be

451
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,180
to update our code so I'll talk about

452
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,639
the first one

453
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,770
so how likely are we to be affected by

454
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,940
fun abilities so we've said before we've

455
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,610
come to the vulnerabilities in have in

456
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,960
the past that might be an indication of

457
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:48,330
where it's gonna happen abilities in the

458
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:50,790
future so if we're not using the

459
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,290
features or the API calls that are the

460
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,420
ones that had one abilities well then I

461
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,070
don't care if I'm using a library and it

462
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,170
has a one ability in a feature that I

463
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,350
don't use that doesn't affect me I'm not

464
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:02,820
bothered however if I have a big library

465
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,780
you know I only use one part of it but

466
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,960
it's the part that's always getting

467
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:09,690
pinged by by the security people that's

468
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,730
gonna make me worried now exactly how

469
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,320
you go about doing that is not something

470
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,600
on your answer today you can just count

471
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,760
features you could look at how many

472
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,350
distinct API calls you made you can talk

473
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,640
about your code coverage statistics this

474
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:26,610
is a really good code coverage tool but

475
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,180
like in general getting some idea of how

476
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,979
much of OS is likely use and in

477
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,820
particular which parts of it you use is

478
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:38,280
a really good idea so when we talk about

479
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,649
the second thing so well I said at the

480
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,149
beginning was what's the question we're

481
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,330
trying to answer should we replace our

482
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:47,610
OSS now we've talked about risk the

483
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,290
other thing we want to talk about is how

484
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,979
much effort it's gonna be to do that

485
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:55,350
replacement work and so that's the other

486
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,330
part of this equation you know if if we

487
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:00,060
only make one or two API calls replacing

488
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,580
that is likely not going to - that the

489
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,080
every file that our code base calls this

490
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,510
library because I don't know we're a

491
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,490
crypto librarians colleagues OpenSSL the

492
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:12,360
whole time that's gonna be a massive

493
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:15,690
headache so again exactly how you

494
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,300
convert code use into man-hours and like

495
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:21,210
their effort is a topic that I'm not

496
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,379
gonna go into but my point here is that

497
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,780
all this information

498
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,220
you shouldn't happen like you know it's

499
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,190
not public because how you use this code

500
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,320
is not public but you can you can put

501
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,780
out up your own code bases so you can

502
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:41,070
get an idea how hard it's going to be to

503
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:42,110
make this up so those are my seven

504
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,860
impactors

505
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:49,419
that I think go into judging the

506
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:52,189
security impact of analysis library

507
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,990
these are the things that we have users

508
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:57,620
are looking for if you know of any

509
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:59,030
others please come tell me afterwards

510
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,709
I'm trying to make this a comprehensive

511
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:04,280
list I've missed any I would love to

512
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:08,030
know I think these are the things that

513
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:12,649
go into judging the security threat that

514
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:14,090
our libraries providing to us so I said

515
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,130
from the beginning what we're trying to

516
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,449
do in the area to make a decision and if

517
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,980
that decision is going to be to a place

518
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,530
for access well then we need to look at

519
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,990
the alternatives but hopefully what

520
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:27,379
we've done here is we have a methodology

521
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:29,720
we have a set of factors to look into so

522
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,429
we can run the same analysis on those

523
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,780
envelopes so you know I have a few

524
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:35,090
libraries in transit so I just want to

525
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,340
use I run the same analysis of the same

526
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,590
factors and then I can make a proper

527
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:45,409
multipliable

528
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:47,149
in - but I can defend the last point as

529
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:50,720
I've said is probably the hardest one is

530
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:53,390
how much effort it's going to be but

531
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,160
there are methodologies out there we can

532
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:58,640
we can we can come up with an estimate

533
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,280
and so then what you've got is a basic

534
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,080
business decision this if I put in this

535
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,010
much effort I'm going to get this much

536
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,659
this much risk reduction everybody's

537
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,000
appetite is going to be different some

538
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,700
people will tolerate no risk at all you

539
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,260
know some people are so overworked that

540
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,730
they have no infant affair and therefore

541
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,120
they'll tolerate huge amount of risk

542
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:22,610
unless it's super trivial - to make the

543
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,080
change so that's the decision that has

544
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:28,610
to be made on a company by company basis

545
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,070
possibly on a project-by-project basis I

546
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:33,168
don't know who but my point here is that

547
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,830
if you have data if you do multiply both

548
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:38,030
of those things then you can make a

549
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:42,799
defensible decision you can make it good

550
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:45,710
data-driven decision so we did this

551
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,470
example and we did this exercise we

552
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,910
haven't come in super in detail I'm not

553
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,010
going to say which two levers it was

554
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,080
because I

555
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:56,860
haven't spoken as those delivery so they

556
00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:00,399
can't defend themselves but we were

557
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,959
using my px with the alternative which

558
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,660
provided the same functionality it was

559
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,620
letting boy and so we looked into the

560
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:10,570
details and you can see that the average

561
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,979
number of vulnerabilities doesn't

562
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,570
actually go down that much like if we

563
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:18,160
were any matching what none ability per

564
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:21,668
year but that's not a big deal but the

565
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,650
key point was development team size so

566
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:26,380
the Allah be on the left was basically

567
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:29,080
just one guy no library baby on the

568
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,960
right it was a property or property

569
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,879
development team and what that meant was

570
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:39,280
when we looked at how long it took

571
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:41,140
patches to be introduced the time the

572
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,610
time it took for patches for

573
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,030
vulnerabilities to get past the library

574
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:49,479
hex was like six months so you know

575
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:51,010
researchers will come along for their

576
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,990
POC on this company's

577
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,309
tracking system and then it would sit

578
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,500
there and then eventually things were

579
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:59,470
going to production on average about six

580
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,780
months later locally y-you know things

581
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,429
were patched within weeks and then they

582
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,799
would release a security point base and

583
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:10,660
then the users will be up to date so

584
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,668
this is the kind of information where if

585
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,440
you're just going on a gut instinct if

586
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:15,669
you're going well it might be too hard I

587
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,710
don't know how much risk and how much

588
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:19,030
risk reduction I'm going to get making

589
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,190
that petition is going to be hot once

590
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:26,168
you have all the data it makes it a lot

591
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:29,410
included to make that decision so where

592
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:31,809
do we go from here so I've talked about

593
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,910
these seven measures you can rate each

594
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:35,320
one of these on a scale I didn't do that

595
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,160
from the previous slide but you know you

596
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,928
could read each one out of ten how much

597
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,390
how much threat you think it's

598
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:46,150
introducing then you can weight those

599
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,250
measures and you can calculate a risk

600
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,660
for placement school so I'm thinking of

601
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,780
here is something that looks a lot like

602
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:55,510
CDSs you know you can look at how many

603
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,780
CDs though how many have how good the

604
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,760
patches were how many developers

605
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,290
they will plug those all into some

606
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,550
algorithm it will spit you out a number

607
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,520
between 0 and 10

608
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:06,409
that's how much risk there is you can

609
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,340
look at how much code you're using that

610
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:15,260
gives you your risk replacement school

611
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:16,429
and as I've said a couple times now all

612
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,860
this information is out there publicly

613
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,750
on the internet there is no reason you

614
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,709
couldn't develop a tool to scrape the

615
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,170
internet pull all this information

616
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:28,040
together and do all this for you

617
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:29,750
automatically when it comes to looking

618
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,340
at your usage of the courage you would

619
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,380
then need to plug that all into your

620
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,199
like code testing your regression

621
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,460
testing software obviously that wouldn't

622
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,050
be public but inside your organization

623
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:45,350
you could do that and and so yeah so

624
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,850
doing this is then requires no manners

625
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,919
at all you can have this just running in

626
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:51,230
the background you can set your level

627
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,420
you know if my risk reduction goes above

628
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,910
this much for this amount of developer

629
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:57,740
effort take me send me an email and

630
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:02,450
they'll make that change and then you

631
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:04,370
can automate all of this and the hard

632
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,760
work goes away and you get security

633
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:10,310
benefit for free we're a long way from

634
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,990
that if anyone wants to develop this

635
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,800
please do so you'll make my life so much

636
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,690
easier

637
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,250
I'm not gonna steal the IP from you or

638
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,670
anything like that but this is where I

639
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:23,030
think we as an industry need to go to

640
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:25,310
make everyone's life easier and that's

641
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:27,740
the end if anyone has any questions you

642
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:29,629
can ask now and I'm outside ping me an

643
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,750
email part the reason I'm giving this

644
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:35,420
talk is to get feedback so so selfish

645
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,130
reason I want people to you know provide

646
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,660
me with the things I've missed the the

647
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:42,890
factors that you take into account

648
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:45,590
you're looking to assess so yeah get in

649
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:48,920
touch with your angles and things like

650
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,149
this pressures down so you measured what

651
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,640
with github

652
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:55,550
that's where I get an saying like this

653
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,320
code develop home so these files are all

654
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,300
this current about but I totally ship it

655
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,010
did it at home this yeah and I've had

656
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,389
that been talked about for do you know

657
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:04,670
how many tools that help you visualize

658
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:06,560
that let's say like this this these

659
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,110
files on this log directory this code

660
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,860
this

661
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:12,600
to be very personal you know I don't

662
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,030
have any tools nope

663
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,620
I don't it feels like it wouldn't be

664
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,330
very hard to develop one you know you

665
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,299
could just look at the gear check-ins

666
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:23,850
and you know you can draw you can draw

667
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:26,250
like a directory Qi just want to do that

668
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,990
I mean is taller than baseball how many

669
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,270
developers is contributing to reach

670
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,790
directory but oh yeah I don't know but

671
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:36,120
he's not to do that today that's just

672
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:38,790
and yeah some of the metrics I do see is

673
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,620
quite typical because all scoot off the

674
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:44,309
meditation for me as a developer would

675
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:48,090
be code of adèle straighted chalk where

676
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:50,549
is to complete newbie they expect to be

677
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,990
sort of step through the guidelines and

678
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:54,480
those kind of things this is quite a

679
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,280
subjective measure that and I also think

680
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,740
people try and gain the system

681
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,440
I love github Austria whole bunch of

682
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:06,330
accounts I don't have how much people

683
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:10,799
the project may serve the heavy protect

684
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:13,049
from game that's a very good point I

685
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,030
would say if a developers going to that

686
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:16,410
much effort to game the system it's

687
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:18,960
probably easier for them to just make

688
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,669
good code like nobody makes byte code

689
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,160
and then choice them place videos give

690
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:25,410
us true Google thing is something far

691
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,120
now because if you're in competition

692
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,940
with one of those others use some

693
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,909
support packages from the OSS a

694
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,890
competition group some songs that you

695
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:36,419
give away the free version right and

696
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,100
then this is all ramped up around

697
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:41,669
outside make money yep

698
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,110
so there will be an incentive to appear

699
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:44,940
high obviously something like that

700
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:48,209
metric will be very good in an answer

701
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:50,040
pack scope my nexus result yep it's a

702
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,320
frog and it would score all the things

703
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,200
that never follow you get embed them

704
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,010
yeah yeah I mean that's kind of what I

705
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,870
haven't minded

706
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,850
yeah there are ways of getting the

707
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,439
system it didn't take you long to get

708
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:06,269
all the bottom and then Amazon's

709
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,769
if the score isn't it I would say I

710
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:09,750
think it's hard to do that for all the

711
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,580
metrics I think ultimately it's going to

712
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,580
be hard to completely fake the library's

713
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:16,949
reading is and and so that's why I had

714
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,529
like you know I mentioned weighting the

715
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:21,120
different letters so you might as you

716
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:23,460
said like for your use you might not

717
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,809
care how good the documentation is you

718
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,879
can just adjust that wasting down to

719
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:28,860
zero the number of vulnerabilities that

720
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:31,590
like this having and passing out how to

721
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,330
get them how critical they were that's

722
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,730
something conveyed but it's like

723
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,639
something poking it right now so that is

724
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:41,700
gonna be a lot harder to manipulate the

725
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:45,899
metric on that one so yes you're right

726
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,669
it's not it's not perfect but I think

727
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:51,120
there is some benefit at least I'm

728
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:54,720
getting users pretends this last is a

729
00:28:51,120 --> 00:29:01,350
she's paying between keep replacing

730
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:03,990
something contribution yes open SSL

731
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:09,080
anything that is expired the community

732
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:09,080
large was that if uses SSL

733
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:19,009
depolymerization waiting yeah who's

734
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:21,179
always doing so however blackberry now

735
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:26,730
other companies I worked for in the past

736
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:28,379
tend to be reluctant to contribute code

737
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,330
that they've both as a company job if

738
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:33,120
it's likely because there's an IP issue

739
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:35,639
there that's not always the case and in

740
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,000
certain I felt you know big companies

741
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:43,080
have but those were things that I mean

742
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,600
but there's massive source license use

743
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,820
my own source code you've got mister

744
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,459
changing right so that that's one point

745
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,080
is that companies are reluctant to make

746
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,399
any changes to talk to poetic about the

747
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,750
parrisha listened to doing that because

748
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,758
they know they have to contribute back

749
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,710
so they will either use the library has

750
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:00,389
published although we use a different

751
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:02,159
largely as part now

752
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:06,330
yeah people should contribute OSS

753
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:09,240
everything like completely agree in

754
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:12,119
real-world situations where I fit him in

755
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,630
my personal experience the decision

756
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:16,129
they're making are we

757
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,740
not going to spend our developer effort

758
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:21,290
on improving just likely I want and quit

759
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:24,410
pegs column I want to reduce my threat

760
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:26,420
phone today the quicker way of doing

761
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:32,270
that sometimes it's just a place of love

762
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:34,970
it yeah this decision make it won't be

763
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:37,820
for everyone and some people will want

764
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,050
to be back to libraries but having

765
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,129
misinformation out there I don't think

766
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:43,210
it hurt anymore

767
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:46,910
if they could see this information yeah

768
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:53,780
do you share your assessments back to

769
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:55,670
the projects and so we don't cut me this

770
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,920
is still quite like an immature project

771
00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:02,870
it's not really up and running in any

772
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:04,070
serious way we should do like the vision

773
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,600
I have for this that sounds a bit

774
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,310
grandiose but like where I see this

775
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,409
going this doesn't all this information

776
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:11,450
should be made public as well so yeah

777
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,430
country maps back to the other source

778
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,870
libraries then as I said part the reason

779
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,460
I'm giving this is so that both if

780
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,439
developers can see the kinds of things

781
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,850
that we looking for you know they might

782
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,250
think but nobody actually cares about

783
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:24,020
them if a story about the right name but

784
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,880
what I'm trying to say here is that if

785
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,990
I'm trying jobs for security risk

786
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,570
that's what other perhaps as I've taken

787
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,980
- ok so yeah like the whole point of

788
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,889
this is to give back to the community

789
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:39,980
and to help people to make more mature

790
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:41,570
or shorter again Thomas a cubist and

791
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:45,050
obviously the information that you need

792
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:48,169
out is hi penny Lightman CDA's do you

793
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:52,700
have any tools as part of our test which

794
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:55,730
looks at inside of a balloon to do with

795
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:59,600
that and you do have you know like I

796
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:01,460
said code review set to a developer how

797
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,250
do you know that the hum injected a

798
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,320
malicious cordage good then I was taken

799
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:08,870
aback I'm doing nothing until days such

800
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,760
a day arises but you know that pop the

801
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:15,290
wide open I see coming off me so

802
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:17,750
suspected but yeah I don't know how many

803
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:19,190
tools that do that I'm just rolling

804
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:22,130
something compacted could get up it's

805
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:26,410
all to do that if you can catch people

806
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:30,310
checking in militias homes you know that

807
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:32,530
mm that would be a massive win if you

808
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:34,540
get something to do that I don't know of

809
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,460
any automated ways of checking for that

810
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,560
so if that's the thing you're worried

811
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:41,050
about then one of the things I mentioned

812
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,550
these period protease so game you know

813
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:45,070
two sets of humanized and look a piece

814
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:46,659
of code as I wished before you could

815
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,740
wipe the different metrics right so if

816
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,900
that's the thing that you're worried

817
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,120
about then you wait that tightly and you

818
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:54,820
say you know I'm getting massively more

819
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,409
trust Pro where two sets of the two

820
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,419
individual developers have looked at

821
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,110
kotodama coded you because that reduces

822
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,660
that risk

823
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:04,000
I know everywhere you completely

824
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:07,920
eradicate that will catch every instance

825
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,920
but that's the major piece

826
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:15,150
