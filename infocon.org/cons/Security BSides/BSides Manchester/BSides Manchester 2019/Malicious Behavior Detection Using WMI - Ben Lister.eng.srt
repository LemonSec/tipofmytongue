1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,120
welcome in

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,360
yes this is my talk on malicious

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,690
behavior detection with WR mine we start

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,429
the little caviar I have a function on

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,349
the timings this could be a 20 minute

6
00:00:17,429 --> 00:00:21,778
job could be applied with it young but

7
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:23,220
it's look next so like the way I'll get

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,439
you all out room and I'll be happy and

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,698
get to lunch early alright

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,710
so Who am I mouki science or math

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,650
graduate graduated in July from the

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,680
University of Manchester I've been an

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:41,850
intern nzc groups in just over two years

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,610
now and on Monday I'm gonna start a

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,120
proper job you know become an advil into

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,820
big wide world and this photo is me for

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,830
a week ago when I was jumping off tower

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,620
in Australia I'm hoping that the Rose

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,989
didn't snap all I heard was bungee

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,890
jumping and I'll say I was less nervous

21
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:03,840
about doing that that answer right now

22
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,549
alright so what this top going to be

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,710
about this is going to be part of the

24
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,229
research of my final year project at

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,699
university so why give them up on your

26
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,619
project if I created a rudimentary

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:19,590
detection system built around WRI and

28
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,369
try to get a better idea about how to

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,829
view my works but also one problem

30
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,469
probably tackle some issues with where

31
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:31,589
comes to detecting a fishy focus on

32
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:34,288
living offline binaries or bobbins so if

33
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,109
you don't know these are binaries

34
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:39,630
executables which you'll find on Windows

35
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:43,259
operating system every day to come with

36
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,939
home with the build and you normal use

37
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,619
of them they're pretty standard so I'm

38
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,219
going to do anything what people find

39
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:55,979
ways for using them or using them in a

40
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:58,619
way trying to malicious activity so what

41
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,249
is WR mine this curry that toughest part

42
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,639
makes its it's not exactly a nice simple

43
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:07,649
concept to work with so the easiest one

44
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:08,949
that got was is an interface for

45
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,200
applications act

46
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:14,260
data provided by the operating system

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,000
and hardware components so what does

48
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,518
that mean well this basically sudhish

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,840
into the paper

50
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,450
it's basically you've got everything

51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,180
every aspect of the operating system the

52
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,339
affinity book processes services to

53
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,930
start commands what you can think of it

54
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,319
there's probably an object which is

55
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:35,230
record WI represents where and if this

56
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,798
objects have properties associated with

57
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:41,470
them and we basically have all these all

58
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:42,940
this data all jumbled together and then

59
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,890
got ways of working with it to be a

60
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,349
protocol to transmit the data around and

61
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:50,380
we have this service that runs and this

62
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:54,849
service that manages that stuff and how

63
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:57,250
is its execution around them all right

64
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:59,290
so what's the most useful thing I found

65
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,650
and so when frame this text and system

66
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,170
was how do we query the data now to do

67
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,989
this w life has its own query language

68
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,569
it's called WQ are very similar tasks

69
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:13,780
you up it's got a few keywords they're

70
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:16,000
different and it's somehow more useful

71
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,430
features like joins and Union that kind

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,709
of thing but for all intensive purposes

73
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,109
are pretty useful and we have these two

74
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:26,350
objects here these are the eventful or

75
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:28,299
object and the event consumer object now

76
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,299
what we can hear winny's in the event

77
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:34,030
filter we give a we're given a query or

78
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:38,709
what the service will do is the service

79
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:40,060
will run it will query for it will look

80
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,690
for this brilliant and return the data

81
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,000
now what will we actually querying for

82
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,950
well we'll have you have look in a foe

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,389
on the right gives you a query so that

84
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:54,130
is looking for the instance creation of

85
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,209
wind and the process objects that is

86
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,480
named Mike Harsha

87
00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,730
so it's pretty simple we look for

88
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,980
instances creative modified or deleted

89
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,780
and then we can pick one of these

90
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:08,160
objects which represent some part of the

91
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,349
operating system and it will return or

92
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,359
any data so in this case it will return

93
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:17,500
any process which is what starts with

94
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:20,500
the word what does the event consumer

95
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,570
objecting well leave a consumer get to

96
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,590
be linked with the event filter

97
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:29,469
this will run on the query data on the

98
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,049
return data from the query so what we

99
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,980
can do is we can run scripts we can

100
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:39,250
combine lines we can log events send

101
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,020
emails through it this whole thing

102
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,480
together with the filter to consumer

103
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:47,020
binding object which is just links or

104
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,820
two sort of service will run it looks

105
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,520
for the event filters it queries to the

106
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,270
data any days this return passwords the

107
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,039
event consumer the event consumer months

108
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,780
so what the example on the right what

109
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,380
we're doing here so we're querying for

110
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:04,059
any powerful object I mean how would

111
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,030
process object of the name PowerShell

112
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:12,250
and then we're going to run this VB

113
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:13,869
script on the return data so looking at

114
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,390
all this so this is where I got the idea

115
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,670
of trends in context we've got a lot of

116
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,130
data we've got a way of querying the

117
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,470
data or a goal way of acting upon the

118
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,870
query data so we can query for events

119
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,730
and that we can act upon them and that

120
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:32,490
gives us the basis of some bomb

121
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:36,490
detection so how is this going to run

122
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,620
out of it so the B on the right is what

123
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,580
we call more files that manage object

124
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,480
wanna now this is how we create objects

125
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:49,060
or one of the ways cream objects tax to

126
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:51,460
W my repository well neighbors stop and

127
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,960
this is just a stand informant what we

128
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,049
do is you would write it this is a text

129
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,219
file with right it would never use a

130
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,100
utility that comes with Windows called

131
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:03,220
Malcolm run that through and it will

132
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:06,130
compile the the tax kill hook and put

133
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,930
the objects into the WI repository that

134
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,330
they themselves will be queried this

135
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,730
will be my service back and look at them

136
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:18,250
we can read them and this is the main

137
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:20,530
way if we can use two things so did it

138
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,790
section system file is there so we get a

139
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,299
big well we're going to create some more

140
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:27,250
files so the each rule if you like we're

141
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,009
gonna cram more file we're going to have

142
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,360
event

143
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:32,479
shelter we should have pulled some

144
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,139
suspicious event this might be like

145
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,300
purchase tration service equation it

146
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,180
might be DLL loading and it might be

147
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,169
could be of various fun things anything

148
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,110
that returns

149
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:47,719
that's just look at it from our VB

150
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,309
script with it the VB script might

151
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:53,389
perform some additional checks if needed

152
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:54,649
it might be that yeah we want to think

153
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:56,180
it's a little bit suspicious we want to

154
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:58,809
try a little bit more we've got a bit

155
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,889
more functionality by reading the script

156
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:02,449
and then what we're going to do so we're

157
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:05,149
going to compile this mod file it's

158
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:06,830
going to go into our pod the tree the

159
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:09,740
service is then going to pull through

160
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:12,680
it's going to go through it finds your

161
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,309
men it runs it runs our script we lock

162
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,089
the event

163
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:21,949
biff-bash-bosh sort see ya so this is a

164
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:25,099
crudely put together diagram found out

165
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:27,050
with word up in ms word kind of

166
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:28,849
described wise but it's es we're gonna

167
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,919
have our detection systems and create

168
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:33,229
the more file it's going to work within

169
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,669
the building of my architecture the

170
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:36,229
service is going to run it's gonna

171
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:40,279
execute our script it's going to write

172
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:43,370
12 so what sort of things are we going

173
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:46,610
to be sending so I kind of split into

174
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:49,819
some more simples and then some more

175
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,259
kind of complex rules so what we're

176
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,699
talking about simple rules we're just

177
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:55,969
looking at things that happening the

178
00:07:52,699 --> 00:08:00,080
behavior of stuff happening at one one

179
00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:02,120
time so this might be looking at command

180
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,149
line arguments like I said so these the

181
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,519
11th one wineries that normal use from

182
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:09,680
is fine which is when a pack is trying

183
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,569
to abuser that's what we're looking for

184
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,969
Tricia's events all of the ways of

185
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:16,729
looking at that is understanding how is

186
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:18,439
being run and a good way understood how

187
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:21,680
is being run is what come on line

188
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:24,469
arguments beans so a great example of

189
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,719
this it might be PowerShell via road and

190
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:29,589
some of using the back exec bypass like

191
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:32,510
yeah that might be a normal or might be

192
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:34,698
an indicator to only indicators that

193
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,880
might be sufficient or might be growing

194
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:39,099
and code

195
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,200
again pretty normal but it could this

196
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,810
end here specialist and the floors don't

197
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,670
offer examples first I'm probably gonna

198
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:47,439
use PowerShell demotes just because it

199
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,530
works well with a lot of the examples

200
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,690
but Shaw a little bit of thinking think

201
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:56,920
some other other things that could be

202
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,720
happening yeah next one they look at was

203
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,689
looking at parent processes so we're

204
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,000
looking at not what's being run but what

205
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,070
is running it so again I'll get using

206
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,220
example a PowerShell is PowerShell runs

207
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,050
normally this run is parent practice is

208
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,330
going to be exploring on XE you know

209
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:17,050
storms justice click the power icon

210
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:20,860
opened up but it's get suspicious when

211
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,420
maybe you get Word or Excel sporting

212
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,830
PowerShell you know you're not probably

213
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,680
gonna have some kind of malicious macro

214
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:29,800
in there and then you can look over

215
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,020
other examples of the kind of check the

216
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,410
hierarchy processes so what all you want

217
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,600
so I don't be the way around this would

218
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:41,110
be you just call its florida exceed and

219
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,430
powerful I see that would get on the

220
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,700
first rule but then you're looking to

221
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:47,859
explore to exceed masking run from say

222
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:50,080
from CMD so you know that's special so

223
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,600
you've got a saw about looking at the

224
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,060
the behavior of how the processes linked

225
00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:00,280
together how what parent process does

226
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:02,800
well from finding simple would be D are

227
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,490
learning so we're going to look at what

228
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,339
dll's

229
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,840
are being loaded into the process so

230
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,430
this uses the slow this is the query

231
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,640
right at the bottom and uses a slightly

232
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:15,160
different type of query will see from

233
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,710
the top to they're both looking for any

234
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,420
instance creation event the bottom one

235
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,620
doesn't use it just like these are

236
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,349
looking for the creation of something

237
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,750
this guy's own event is the modulo trace

238
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:29,710
which is event that comes up every time

239
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:32,260
a DLL is loaded into a process so what

240
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:34,630
this will return this will return the

241
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:37,510
name of the deal are being loaded and

242
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,010
the name of the process is going into so

243
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,840
the system that management automation

244
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,060
deal is

245
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,290
but powerful deal it's basically if

246
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,369
you're if you're running some kind of

247
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:50,050
power shotguns or you're looking into

248
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,200
that functionality you're going to need

249
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,740
this dll so obviously if powder loading

250
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,060
in that's fine that's normal behavior

251
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,500
but you may look at other processes

252
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,989
loading in anything

253
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,600
yeah that's not right something's going

254
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:09,610
on there I'll give an example of a

255
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:11,200
little later on and then that we have so

256
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,300
there are a lot of simple rules and then

257
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,920
I don't have to have any examples to

258
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,109
these we have some ideas and more

259
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,979
complex rules

260
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,960
so these are what you're looking at

261
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,370
maybe a bit of a wider picture you're

262
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,940
not just looking at what's happening a

263
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,830
very shortly and the first one is

264
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,660
looking at frequency based schools so

265
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,240
this is where you're looking at an event

266
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,250
might if you just happen once it might

267
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,170
not be suspicious if it's happening a

268
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,180
lot of times in a very short period of

269
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,069
time then that might be something that

270
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,609
you're looking at and you can run all

271
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,520
that with these WMI queries so if

272
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,160
there's a special clause but having

273
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:52,240
which is where you do like a select your

274
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,610
a been within the women clause in

275
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,470
keywords all about the period of time of

276
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,010
looking at removing one means within the

277
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,280
last minute

278
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:03,250
and if you then I'm having it maybe

279
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,510
having 100 and I'm saying this events

280
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,990
happened over hundred times in the last

281
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,040
minute maybe that's that big enough

282
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,280
something suspicious

283
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,219
and finally linking rules together so

284
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,670
again one process doing one thing might

285
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,410
not be suspicious multiple processes

286
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:24,250
doing slightly different things so you

287
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:27,069
might have the creation of file say my

288
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:29,950
Psalms written to deal fast death and

289
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,570
then they've run from dealer well maybe

290
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,900
that might be a suspicious event you

291
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,950
know they're not exactly

292
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,900
you're not exactly looking at that

293
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,520
happening a lot it might just almost

294
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,250
drop their malicious payload and then

295
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,420
using one of these logins to run it so

296
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,830
you can create those like that by

297
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,479
linking them adding you some line

298
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,520
logical operators into your commands

299
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,650
enter your queries you can get pretty

300
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,360
intense with it they can be as long as

301
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:55,230
you want

302
00:12:51,360 --> 00:13:00,329
they match will you just lay by the few

303
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:07,619
keywords that you have all right and

304
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:10,769
yeah I said pretty sure yeah yeah if you

305
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:14,009
want more there is this market Humber

306
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:17,009
there's a the whole project so there's a

307
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:19,549
nice long read over fall which goes into

308
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:22,619
a lot more detail than Apple in today

309
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:25,739
and yet this mobile cook does one

310
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:27,959
example that will give actually house

311
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:36,860
can have a demo video for laps about

312
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:36,859
passwords it'll be alright

313
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:42,209
yeah the example the demo video is gonna

314
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:44,399
show is going to give example the deal a

315
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:46,290
lot everyone and this is a little most

316
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,929
fun part my project was working out how

317
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:51,540
it's because it's not something that you

318
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:53,249
see them all kind of thing so why that

319
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,439
was a bit is I've created a malicious

320
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:59,220
macro trying to malicious think that

321
00:13:55,439 --> 00:14:00,899
Trinidad malicious dotnet 0 which had to

322
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,459
make but which was an unmanaged year

323
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:04,379
also could be loaded in by the word

324
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:07,859
process and I created malicious micro

325
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:10,319
and the macro load with live she had was

326
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,049
a one-liner Peng it loaded in this DLL

327
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:15,540
and random function this function excuse

328
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:18,929
and PowerShell and what that meant is

329
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:21,540
the macro had full capabilities of your

330
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:23,399
PowerShell commands yeah you could run

331
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,339
you militias payloads about this kind of

332
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:28,529
thing but never actually use PowerShell

333
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:30,779
if you looked up your practicing support

334
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:32,519
ourselves never called you know they

335
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,980
shoot is all coming from it with all

336
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,629
excelled IX e so this is like so there's

337
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,970
not a lot of indicators for something

338
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:43,069
that I've got you there upon a macro to

339
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:45,419
be alone so what we have there is an

340
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:48,689
example of the deal are being loaded in

341
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:50,569
and what will happen is that module load

342
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:53,248
rings event would be called Oh

343
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:55,679
systems automation dot management have

344
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:56,939
been loaded loaded into Excel by XE

345
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:00,419
that's suspicious

346
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:02,639
and we would have a good happen it's a

347
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:05,550
lot more interesting in the video but I

348
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,530
thought the memories were good but

349
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:12,609
watch it anacondas up but hey thanks for

350
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:28,209
coming I hope you've enjoyed it I hope

351
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:29,460
you got one job any questions soon

352
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:33,480
you're like handsome to fight those

353
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:36,280
pitchbook postures yeah testing it was

354
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,370
lengthy process especially the some

355
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:43,060
lights on the dl uploading rules that

356
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,790
was basically a runner rule

357
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,709
look at my logs how maybe like at one

358
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,050
point I ran it I just had it running for

359
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:52,090
about a minute and my log file had about

360
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,740
thousand entries that I had to go

361
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,140
through like work hard what is this

362
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,810
process doing it was one of the big

363
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,730
things this is a kind of a background

364
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:05,079
process that pre-compile a lot on that

365
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,670
do deals so I can notice existed so when

366
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,260
you're looking at DLL loading this wall

367
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,120
with load in so we'll do a little bit

368
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,610
pre-population before the process needs

369
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,350
them so I can have to light this that

370
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,840
one and then look back through log this

371
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:20,980
is a lot less thing is but yeah but

372
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:24,340
intense process so possi old things that

373
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:29,830
was around detection wanted to say bill

374
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:32,250
to prevent yeah so like not going to

375
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:36,070
detection I was just writing for logs

376
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:38,260
yeah kind of restricted by just having

377
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,600
BB scripts like that was pretty much all

378
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,120
be excused my heart it's not I finally

379
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,100
saw right in this moment it's it's old

380
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,010
for reason no one uses it for reason

381
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,650
there is a discount

382
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:52,960
I never implemented it but a good way of

383
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:56,439
getting around that would have been if

384
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:59,980
you implement in a college jet sure a BB

385
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,950
script can then will not call again but

386
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,540
come object could be written like C++ or

387
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,350
the seashell that gives you a bit more

388
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,389
functionality

389
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:10,990
you don't look there's more prevention

390
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,980
stuff so like this process is running we

391
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,250
think it's dodgy

392
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,300
alright let's fill operands are looking

393
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,200
at a more

394
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:23,290
yet more product if you're trying to

395
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,540
walk not using the comics is the

396
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,119
philosophy a good way of looking to the

397
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,340
notch like Windows notifications so like

398
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,860
what suspicious have had occurred you

399
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,570
could pop up a notification guess want

400
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,669
to check it money leave

401
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,760
yeah I'm call of I never really got

402
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:42,760
round time restraints a unique on had

403
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,170
enough time tapes monopoly but it's got

404
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,690
to be something that without how old

405
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:58,210
cabbage I just feel a lot more fit

406
00:17:48,690 --> 00:18:01,660
thanks Jesus person saying okay yes yeah

407
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:05,590
Sevilla the the big downside of this

408
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:07,870
disease relied on the process name as if

409
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,840
someone's changing the person's name you

410
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:15,310
gonna get around them I didn't realize

411
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:17,889
this yet bit to lay out but they're all

412
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:20,169
they're all moving indicators you would

413
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,420
have a look for like you could then you

414
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:25,030
go to the thing is create an event for

415
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:27,760
the file modification event so someone's

416
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:31,020
saying alright I want to run PowerShell

417
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,040
maliciously I'll get change it its name

418
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,770
that make you look for a pop

419
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,950
modification os1 changing the name back

420
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:41,710
seat or DLL awesome blog and the new

421
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,630
credit is that would be an overhaul and

422
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,640
another suspicious event that you pick

423
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:49,780
up so people changing it into system

424
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:55,780
file is also not at all be tempted using

425
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:57,490
the same double your libraries I so the

426
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:03,270
best way to learning

427
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:11,770
yeah is to copy PowerShell today I

428
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:13,930
legitimate yeah I see and yeah I mean

429
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:17,620
yeah be good dipping into you then have

430
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:21,550
a look at so I'm crazy legitimate yeah

431
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:28,000
we told by something else yeah I don't

432
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:29,710
recognize that but that we get into by

433
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,929
adding some pot like so

434
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,399
by to the farm motor casing and just

435
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:36,720
change things it's like songs copying

436
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:40,090
stuff but I said or deleting stuff

437
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,980
actually it says in Texas as strong as

438
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,799
the amount of effort that you want to

439
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,890
put in to create rules like I think so

440
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,889
you have to like happy citizen part of

441
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:54,549
that days of my life to to stop people

442
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:59,230
doing so by that you had overalls which

443
00:19:54,549 --> 00:20:01,840
detected people doing but if you just

444
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,520
have the basic will that them Fred stay

445
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:09,658
then yeah you're right so now if you

446
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,658
think internet that easy job okay I

447
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,350
think about like a minute lesser by one

448
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,840
by sure maybe is everywhere I'm gonna

449
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:22,129
like a lunch great stuff

450
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,129
[Applause]
