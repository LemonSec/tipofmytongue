6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,180
something to publicize me I'm up fairly

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,300
late edition so I could be now fitted in

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,640
there about five minutes ago to check it

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,210
we're starting off with a degree in

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,980
botany long live the soft white house

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,109
because of consultants we got into the

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,519
ground full web developer in month not

13
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:45,120
man connect to the web

14
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:51,218
yes I'm not all ships typically special

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:54,459
so at the age and I mostly do study

16
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:57,249
learning and over the final year

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,460
projects and first a bit on the side I'm

18
00:00:57,249 --> 00:01:03,850
taking techniques and so today I'm a

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:07,840
loss what lose your hat and how do you

20
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:15,550
think design making a case by case basis

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:23,980
may be careful together hand is up to

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:26,440
use the decided to hacker happy going to

23
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,820
the station this morning on top of my

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,450
latest on the gap on the hate line

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,059
checking tickets

26
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,820
look at his competence to say hello

27
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:41,280
understand my culture behind the

28
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:46,720
intersect conferences cyber security

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:51,070
cyber suppose alright busy thank you

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,770
and so it's a common shorthand has a bit

31
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:58,539
of bad guys are they really cause

32
00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:05,009
they're not he won't be here for really

33
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:09,280
level diversity through last fall and so

34
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:12,460
it didn't used to be like that how I

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,780
used to be a constant term and I with

36
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:20,140
the other perp X voice Oh

37
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,000
our code shortcut inclusion modification

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,799
the Pelican ticket to a publisher

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,020
chapter new committee trying to get the

40
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,630
slot to work I was happy

41
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:34,690
we used to be a cover piece of courage

42
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,530
unity who originally came through some

43
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:43,420
hacking improvement for existing systems

44
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:47,950
but a lot from late 1960s that I play

45
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:52,660
the loose nineteen seventies the mid

46
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:55,329
1980s personal computer started to

47
00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:00,600
appear my father looked rather

48
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:03,160
suspiciously at my spectrum and he said

49
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,730
he's not going to spend all my secrets

50
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:11,109
all over the world and I don't we've not

51
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:13,959
amendment he was raised with our favor

52
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,120
work that was taxes on it you shall not

53
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,310
be kept private

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,500
yes it's not connected to any of these

55
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:25,840
what's this why that's the payment alone

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,829
we've got the Modi's and then you've got

57
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,590
the films that glamorized it things like

58
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,150
wargames

59
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,269
hackers no longer content with benign

60
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:40,900
improvements younger ones in particular

61
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:43,720
looking at a bit of pain because of

62
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,660
publicity and of course we've got to

63
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,269
keep half the planet firmly in mind yes

64
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:54,100
Missy I knew you let me get to like that

65
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:57,640
mention in their academics then the

66
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,230
world wide web came along and apartment

67
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,100
providing lots of opportunities for

68
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,090
doing really good stuff hey hey

69
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,590
sentimental opportunities for doing

70
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:13,420
cooking stuff with packet dance nothing

71
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:15,459
about the passwords NC chefs invading

72
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,390
privacy all the fun stuff you can do

73
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:24,039
with my hands

74
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:28,659
why do we talk about hats if I can be

75
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:30,370
new short pants I told you at all but

76
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:35,830
Apple iPhone these

77
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:39,639
Westen's if you tell the lone ranger who

78
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:42,609
died because he hadn't why hassle I mean

79
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,960
it was a bit shifty very often done to

80
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,790
the mast on that

81
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,479
he's got a white hat we've got speak of

82
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:51,040
going and simply the LSAT himself he's

83
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:55,690
got a black hat and he's the back

84
00:04:51,040 --> 00:05:00,940
darling so it gives us a shorthand so we

85
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:05,740
have the hunters the hackers my teeth

86
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:09,370
back in they've got the black hats poke

87
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:12,060
around but it's a war easy as I've been

88
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,680
malicious or personal gain

89
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:28,780
we've got white house the internet with

90
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:34,630
hackers wall through symbols never work

91
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:49,299
with children animals or technology or

92
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:53,349
medical services literally years later

93
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:57,870
very quickly to active why you'd be kind

94
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:57,870
of bothering it wouldn't be interested

95
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:06,789
they have that past the violate computer

96
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,830
security little vision beyond being

97
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:11,020
malicious look just people they can

98
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:15,010
actually see some way of making some

99
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,659
money easily they let them the amount of

100
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:20,699
effort it's in liquid usually make some

101
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:25,810
money what a multi good the slurs learn

102
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:28,990
quite happy ethical hackers their tactic

103
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,840
permeability testing security of systems

104
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:38,500
might be hard to do so maybe just

105
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:39,940
curious and the gray hats it might

106
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,390
happen to assist in the powerful

107
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,910
violation and then

108
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,190
straight film bilities often have be

109
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:51,450
perfect with the true rules but panty

110
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:55,260
Navy John and so we classified the names

111
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:57,719
Turner for an all and seeing who decide

112
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:00,800
to have us at their feet never efforts

113
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,650
to make it to gray hats on them then

114
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:16,650
those have got branded as a nationwide

115
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:20,340
waffles and many have got the various

116
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:22,919
types of hacker but most of us don't

117
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:30,000
fall into the one have to be all the

118
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:33,000
time most of us is so only we are honest

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,660
will do if picture unfortunate it's

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,410
alright because our that's it so many

121
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:43,350
shades of through right through various

122
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:46,230
shades of gray to black most of us are

123
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:56,060
somewhere in there most of the time

124
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:56,060
convergence and it was often to ignite

125
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:06,680
and so how did you decide what we really

126
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,680
are where we stand

127
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:13,100
maybe something I get this compel YRF

128
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:17,240
it's important cause

129
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:21,540
Willis helped us decide where we sound

130
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:27,120
what we are known for what sort of

131
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:30,360
people we are we need to make decisions

132
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,750
on the right position pop the wrong

133
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,560
decision as it can buy us a model

134
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:42,169
decompose or quite happy just living in

135
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:46,560
line not paying much attention at all

136
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:48,449
athletes different long toes Marcos

137
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,640
guide behavior we've got the law of the

138
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,520
land we've got the ten commandments

139
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,610
you've got very ascetic rules for units

140
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:00,939
ten normal degrees of bed

141
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:04,580
they're not an impersonal an analysis of

142
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:08,390
night ethics and the things that shine a

143
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:12,470
light upon it and now how we make up our

144
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:15,910
mind or parlo code is then three the

145
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:19,100
lobbied ethic anyway questionings

146
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:22,189
deciding who feels bad poking around a

147
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,529
bit thinking about things the world

148
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:30,560
itself derived from the great work ethic

149
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:33,019
offs and ejected the Vsauce a custom or

150
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,260
a habit in English this is the way to do

151
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:35,260
things

152
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:44,000
there's a study of the values and

153
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:46,250
customs of the person or group Republic

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,350
should be looking at what's right wrong

good neither responsibility how are used

156
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:59,329
to looking at human behavior Bank blacks

157
00:09:53,779 --> 00:10:02,149
those rock stars great storm blew up

158
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:05,810
just after white Boris Johnson

159
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:08,329
indecisive first bar exam during the run

160
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:11,260
into presence which other people say

161
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:14,479
well that very fact that we can actually

162
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,939
discuss it to everything about plans

163
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,980
tweaking just the direction we wanted to

164
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,890
gather other people so actually we'll

165
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,690
just get on with this we be strong

166
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:30,319
opinions as some people say it's good

167
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:31,100
something to say that I'm going to put

168
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,890
it succinctly

169
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:38,839
I think severely about doing the right

170
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:41,300
thing even if nobody is looking moles is

171
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,279
more about if someone's looking on the

172
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,079
basic speed limit because inflation is

173
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:51,649
going down below

174
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:56,439
right on but ethics means I dive in

175
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:56,440
speed limit because room that's legal

176
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:04,269
so what is the right thing and to decide

177
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,940
some look to this morality comes from

178
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:15,170
the Latin wall or s in which the English

179
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:18,970
words mole morality divide again that

180
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:21,530
which is possible at least accepted

181
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:25,940
moles tell us what is right and wrong

182
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:30,819
what is good needed but what determines

183
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:33,410
them some people look to their faith

184
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,950
which is all won't look you have to have

185
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:40,339
one people who don't believe in a deity

186
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:45,230
as just as ethical justice Caitlyn very

187
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:47,480
multi as those who do of what you

188
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,970
believe may bring if it's completely

189
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,040
different conclusion and those that we

190
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:58,180
reached by other people's people is for

191
00:11:52,040 --> 00:12:05,930
me hopefully somebody who is Jewish

192
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:07,310
there was fight done teeth for my father

193
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:17,000
who's really my boss that you have

194
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:18,469
surname we that the left of us you know

195
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,990
we don't agree with that Minnie

196
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:24,650
I don't really want to get into that

197
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:29,150
catfight religions start popping get out

198
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:31,189
the way perhaps some sets down to the

199
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:37,640
law a little step up and do it I'll do

200
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:39,470
it can either be which is permit inside

201
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,800
will do it for it's not expressly

202
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:46,700
forbidden so I might doing so I'm going

203
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,990
it what is the goal for it ought to be

204
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:54,880
for everybody but of course it isn't

205
00:12:49,990 --> 00:13:00,310
changes over time is this a good thing

206
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,310
should develop in absolute never is

207
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:07,730
there is people's come up with ideas

208
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:12,530
because they never apply equally to all

209
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:18,140
people it shows this having very fixed

210
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:19,579
house or business would idea now just

211
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,300
himself environment

212
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:25,720
conditions which may or may not be if

213
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,870
there's ideas nice to have a law that

214
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,610
law codes that actually fits with what

215
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:37,300
you all believe but it may not be the

216
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:40,580
right idea everyone so morality little

217
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,550
natural all the parents for the Equality

218
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,620
underlies the law and it follows because

219
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:51,170
you've got these wrong code the law is

220
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:54,350
enshrining him to leave a contradiction

221
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,930
to the lawyer type hold laws quite

222
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,740
faculty moles

223
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:02,959
you just follow it either way and

224
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:09,520
hopefully keep society stable safe

225
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:12,440
skilled and finding more dense because

226
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:16,880
so many nasty things

227
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:21,740
all of those slavery segregation

228
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:25,400
all these things were legal the law also

229
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:28,760
you could do it until people change

230
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:32,140
their minds realize it is wrong and the

231
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:34,370
law now says you can't keep slaves

232
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:39,740
separate people on buses or anything

233
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:42,200
like that do you think the state is good

234
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:46,190
placement ethics elite is going to grow

235
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,400
going to turn them down the

236
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:51,110
constitutional democracy the model

237
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,620
contents of law must be given by the

238
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,930
morality of the legislators not the

239
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:00,410
cookies the judges just interpret them

240
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:03,050
all but in a democracy we elected

241
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:07,370
politicians and hopefully they do our

242
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:09,050
bidding very rarely of course you might

243
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,780
have said were above the law

244
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,910
we don't need laws because that's the

245
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,670
people concentrate them anyway

246
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,990
we'll see where that our value is on

247
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,740
again all over it

248
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:27,290
the good manners part of the laws that

249
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:29,750
the tea is doing which is right Lord

250
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,290
turn out to by authorities and to

251
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,240
developers assemblies at

252
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:38,949
that vestige of have you got in your

253
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:41,949
community mold has developed not my one

254
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:44,519
central authority but viola members of

255
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:51,130
society

256
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:52,540
we have decided what we accept they

257
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:56,500
developed over a period of time

258
00:15:52,540 --> 00:16:00,630
experience reason it will be quite a lot

259
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:04,029
of debate them legitimacy of certain or

260
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:07,839
instead of example Google's about the

261
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:12,430
use of cannabis it's changing becoming

262
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:16,630
more more likely from various countries

263
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:19,229
in various states that the recreational

264
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,550
use of cannabis is now being committed

265
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:24,790
there beat license isn't well perhaps

266
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:29,920
that it becoming committed by other

267
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:33,670
places and get for interpretation of

268
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,680
rules are accepted some rules are more

269
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,740
checks than others them people are to go

270
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:42,069
and try and change them and this is why

271
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:44,440
fix comes in it shines a light on the

272
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:47,410
long home to see if the all based on it

273
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:51,699
are correct and if they're being applied

274
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:58,779
correctly there won't be nothing to come

275
00:16:51,699 --> 00:17:01,149
for there are no surfaces this is where

276
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:06,099
the fun that comes in debates arguments

277
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:09,270
opinion it ain't easy but your own

278
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:14,230
ethical standards should become the sky

279
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:18,209
of your entire career or indeed you have

280
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:23,040
a whole life everything you should do

281
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:23,040
called on to your actual ethical terms

282
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,980
events do what everyone else is doing

283
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:32,470
but rather than what is right well do

284
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:37,150
what is right regardless of iphone

285
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:45,640
else's doing guest is going to have to

286
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:46,450
decide each of us yeah that's right we

287
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,399
all have to

288
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:52,299
decide class smells what we're going to

289
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:55,899
do that by eating say all just knows

290
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:59,610
what we're going to do but what do we do

291
00:17:55,899 --> 00:18:03,070
hiren is that one end of the situation

292
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:06,010
is up to the individual so then yeah a

293
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:12,519
bit longer can get more than one spot

294
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:18,158
one pulls the MOSFET brought so we

295
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:21,760
obviously want to seek help their

296
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:27,039
various ethical sins that's one version

297
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,960
of the game to make detail as you can

298
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,940
see from the cartoon right at the

299
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,940
standing around the bar ruthless

300
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:39,549
consequentialism is quite fun the night

301
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,240
O'Laughlin blackness along some action

302
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:47,200
depends on the consequences yakking

303
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:50,320
cutting a piece of string is very bad of

304
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,169
itself please bear we've got my heavy

305
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:57,189
microphone for kitty it's definitely not

306
00:18:53,169 --> 00:19:00,519
a good thing to do is it so complicated

307
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:05,519
as it looks at what the outcome if the

308
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:05,519
outcomes good and the actions okay -

309
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:13,809
there's no good or bad is just the

310
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:18,928
action and consequence see some types of

311
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:24,158
that but it's based on your own design

312
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:27,779
based on the utility utilitarian view of

313
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:30,880
city as many people as possible or

314
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:33,090
algorithm and you're benefiting other

315
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,010
people rather than yourself

316
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:39,279
so living under that heavy falling

317
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:41,139
weight - let's do the kitty may well be

318
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,090
an optimistic at least to the benefit of

319
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:47,830
the kissing that you might get squashed

320
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:50,189
along the way deontology best said when

321
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:54,899
he got with teeth in

322
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:57,820
focuses of the will behind the act an

323
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:59,928
action is good if you've got a good

324
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,260
reason to did perform in it

325
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:08,799
comes from the Greek tale of duty love

326
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:12,860
science understanding of music so but

327
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:16,158
why did you do that thing and if your

328
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:19,539
intention to this we might be gathered

329
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:23,870
it actually makes mr. messing about it

330
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:28,070
the do what is right the world make

331
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:32,689
hellish live your life everything you do

332
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:34,418
is going to become Universal nor take

333
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:38,600
thou shalt not kill

334
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:41,720
okay models but whether or not you have

335
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,418
been Christian appropriately literally

336
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,909
is not going about it

337
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:51,200
killing other human beings tempting

338
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:54,320
throw it may be eternal they might be

339
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,090
feeling sensing that link so I don't

340
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:02,720
want to encourage them entities that

341
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:06,250
idea don't say kill into that what about

342
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:10,760
an insurgent plugged into your hands

343
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:13,600
maybe that's not quite so bad if you are

344
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,340
able to say I'm protecting my family

345
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,889
looking at protecting other people as I

346
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,959
also some coming in and doing those

347
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,960
doing an activity good good it's

348
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,220
protecting other people

349
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:32,059
the law says reasonable thoughts

350
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:35,480
I'm not going quite as far as I'm happy

351
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:39,289
like an elephant and of course there's a

352
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:42,169
whole thing and typically the

353
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:45,110
intelligent intention ISM well that

354
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:48,140
quite often when various legal examples

355
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:53,360
come to mind but Tony Martin case on the

356
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:57,110
loop chuckles burglar and was said that

357
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,260
masterful here at leaves a fat but he

358
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:02,240
didn't go out the country hits these

359
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,320
phones turn up at all and dials up

360
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,080
people help

361
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:08,740
and so he's only got he had to do

362
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,600
something about this because trouble

363
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,600
trouble trouble masters and

364
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,770
running away

365
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,610
people actually come in so there's a lot

366
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:29,240
of debate about that he put a lot you

367
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:32,479
should be heated up Leyland more much

368
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,550
more recent chat through broken and

369
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,720
sentence and the difference that the

370
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:41,570
screwdriver in the kitchen so fun is

371
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,730
picked up and I didn't actually strike

372
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:48,320
him with this but the burden of atoms

373
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:50,810
which entitles consequence and for me

374
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,260
said that's fine II didn't do anything

375
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:57,080
wrong sir

376
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:01,840
the further among should not be recorded

377
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:04,460
business it and we've got you in nature

378
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,030
we have general calculations lead them

379
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:12,470
to live happily together and any actions

380
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:15,770
the trap of natural identical somebody

381
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:18,110
came in sat down beside Marilyn stopped

382
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:23,800
being trapped in help and I like this

383
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:29,320
and I only remember to eat lobster so

384
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:33,290
that was sort of nice ethical behavior

385
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:37,179
we look at how actions are or are not

386
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:40,340
compatible with the way don't we they

387
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:43,760
was Plato said but that equals of good

388
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:47,899
is not included nature but a man had to

389
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,350
choose now instead to choose more evil

390
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:56,170
action that you can choose let alone

391
00:23:50,350 --> 00:24:01,909
boom so this is human nature

392
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:04,730
maybe it's human habit if I give

393
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:07,970
positioning and of course people use an

394
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:14,540
excuse it's just human nature collection

395
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:17,750
apparently unethical act we have the

396
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:21,020
Family Guy holding forth about some

397
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:23,660
rather dodgy behavior at work just human

398
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,730
nakedness up up to people good you on

399
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,180
those beneath you and then the cut no

400
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,180
equals

401
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:37,210
you have emotivism ethical statements

402
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,669
have no intrinsic value they're based on

403
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,770
how you feel

404
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:43,300
ethical statements are meaningless it's

405
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:48,910
just based on your own emotional

406
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:55,210
position it can't be verified or Nothing

407
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:58,150
objective about it it's how you feel the

408
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,710
moral judgment gives over your attitude

409
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:05,530
how you feel about it

410
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:10,720
notable persons like anywhere attracting

411
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:15,010
her a little not who happen to find in

412
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:22,140
going on then we have had an ism life is

413
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:24,129
all about having fun little later most

414
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,880
associated with the ancient Greek

415
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:32,410
philosopher Epicurus the reckon that

416
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:34,540
life's goal to maximize pain and blue

417
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:38,890
much pain and maximize pleasure of

418
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:40,230
standard rudder and people's about the

419
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:42,550
pursuit of happiness

420
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:45,220
because he reckoned that tearing

421
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,780
happiness needed to do good thing it

422
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:53,140
make everyone feel good that would be

423
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:55,000
really nice maybe went a bit far won't

424
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,510
worry about death as long as we exist

425
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,390
yeah we've got that and haunted us come

426
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:08,110
we have to do so again pounding them and

427
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:10,780
then Thomas More book utopia trying to

428
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,840
be happy up behaving a little model and

429
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:16,930
way we should pursue pleasures that

430
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,379
their nerves Napoli grounded and not

431
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:21,250
become preoccupied with artificial

432
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,870
luxuries

433
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,870
so what do we do with all these theories

434
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:35,950
beautiful knocking around that might

435
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:40,050
help you find Olivia will do to others

436
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:40,050
as you would have them do unto you

437
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,910
there's some version of that at the

438
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:47,590
court that virtually every village ooh

439
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:51,030
there's nine major ones who all say

440
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:56,429
something pretty much on those lines

441
00:26:51,030 --> 00:27:02,340
however religions all the factories

442
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:02,340
external non-human authority their deity

443
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:09,370
which makes it hard to question their

444
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:12,130
ideas because if you believe in them

445
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:14,709
you certainly aren't going to become say

446
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:18,550
Heavenly Father what do you think little

447
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:23,470
doing here you don't go to there to my

448
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:29,590
life and if you don't believe them also

449
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:31,690
they mean is I'm I talking to the sky it

450
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:34,870
may be speaking to assert their wolves

451
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:38,740
without any any sort of evidence to

452
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:41,770
point to it any nationality loads of

453
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:45,670
potential abuse you can closely gain the

454
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:50,830
humans for that but even later that it

455
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:54,490
wanted if you believe in what you say so

456
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:58,449
fiction but now I'm part of the golden

457
00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:01,030
little consistency Confucius said look

458
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:04,660
if you're going to repay evil with

459
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:10,389
kindness or two things will be paid fine

460
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:11,820
this way I believe you vehicles good

461
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,620
behavior

462
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,110
it's nothing I'm really guide in

463
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,929
together people don't do things for

464
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:23,800
nothing so maybe we'll go to the silver

465
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:26,380
rule do not do unto others what you have

466
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:31,750
not what you would not have to run to

467
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:35,700
you couple of things personal gifts that

468
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:40,590
the gambling Martin Luther King

469
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:43,770
identified that but for the best people

470
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:47,439
lots will pay violence before Mullins

471
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:52,360
will not be compliant just a 911 sample

472
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:55,150
one in Milan Gary is especially very

473
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,909
concerned is early years about

474
00:28:55,150 --> 00:29:03,370
the sequences televisions in fact

475
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:08,080
affable poultry didn't give a monkey

476
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:10,030
about black people one so that people

477
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:19,210
came in and said everything you have to

478
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:21,370
take was to lose these bins mean they

479
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:25,510
like though nonviolent civil

480
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:30,040
disobedience in a way it was melting the

481
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:31,960
heart to death Bassets if it were and it

482
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,080
certainly pull a lot of public opinion

483
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:39,640
move on to their side so it led

484
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:42,340
eventually to legislation there's

485
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,320
straighten things out we've got the

486
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,949
shift in ethics is rather shift in

487
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,710
models examples of through then we have

488
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:57,400
the grazing room do unto others as they

489
00:29:50,710 --> 00:30:00,190
do unto you they Pat Metheny they pay

490
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,070
kindness of kindness but even with

491
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:08,160
justice an eye for an eye alert

492
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,159
Institute one good turn deserves another

493
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:16,570
human chimpanzee behavior is quite often

494
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:20,590
teen that way you can conceive them

495
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:22,950
after one another that very nice one but

496
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:27,399
they can squabble and start bickering

497
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:29,350
human beings can do the same so this

498
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,559
grazing rule doesn't have to appeal to

499
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:37,360
better nature is a kind of Oakland

500
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:41,940
conditioning we were all others who are

501
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,229
nice to punish them when they're not

502
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:49,360
we're not pushovers that we're not

503
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:52,960
unforgiving either then it gets bit done

504
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:57,669
the are we will do unto others as you

505
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,830
like before they go unto you if

506
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:04,840
objection is rather contentious at the

507
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:06,909
girl will return to any title it's a

508
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,679
secret maximum money if they can get

509
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:12,100
away with it even though probably

510
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:15,310
bitches you know certain preset to the

511
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:21,010
powerful including a certain and doesn't

512
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:24,399
gentleman Baltimore and then you go go

513
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:27,820
back to what probably I would say suck

514
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:40,300
up to those above you intimidate there's

515
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:42,370
the little link gold one else no no no

516
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,360
hollow it built now and so bullet symbol

517
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:48,189
is flexible

518
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,010
then there's nepotism if questions are

519
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:54,970
all things that close relatives stuff

520
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:58,900
the best gold rules versus Allen will

521
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:01,810
prevent any dilution we biologists will

522
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:06,220
call it in selection and it's my

523
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:12,850
eeveelution works so which of these is

524
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:16,300
the best we need some kind of what type

525
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:17,399
of society do we want to have some are

526
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,340
better than others

527
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:24,340
you want to dictatorship or democracy

528
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:26,459
you want capitalism socialism or

529
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:29,110
something else

530
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,960
suppose we seek not to confirm or deny

531
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:36,969
what we've been sold but to find out

532
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:41,950
what really works do a way to test our

533
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:46,390
rules see great a little bit Unforgiven

534
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:49,240
great vendetta's you live in some

535
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:53,350
Italian month how you might be happy

536
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:56,340
going out the door some shooting some

537
00:32:53,350 --> 00:33:00,699
people most of it done by Venice

538
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:05,399
golden syllables its it replacement they

539
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:08,470
can systematically reward bad behavior

540
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:13,420
it's hard to imagine it those dull being

541
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:14,860
chained in bailing themselves like elite

542
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:20,790
people other people setting a good

543
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:22,510
example of and the IRA started this list

544
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:27,280
and let a few

545
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:33,330
right off show buckshot affordable DL is

546
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:33,330
the only thing in between he said was

547
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:42,040
though what we use rational intuition

548
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:46,059
does this make sense does the decision

549
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:50,980
we've made make sense can we justify it

550
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:53,889
by our lack of thinking this is what my

551
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,870
client it's called sensitive and knowing

552
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,440
where you stand and being able to argue

553
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:01,989
case for where you stand

554
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,540
did you know Mike hold that opinion even

555
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:11,050
those who don't agree with it might well

556
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:13,869
be these party convinced through the

557
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:15,700
moral rules have a parent organization

558
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:20,020
and relationship what are the

559
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:22,469
consequences and so interview can be

560
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,469
rules

561
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:31,090
first of all the mom test this thing you

562
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:38,190
want to do would you be happy if your

563
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:38,190
mom knew about it not a very Christian

564
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:45,190
but whatever you're doing may be within

565
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:48,190
your ethical hacking on the part of your

566
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:51,790
life would you really truly be happy if

567
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:55,450
your mother needing done it if you're

568
00:34:51,790 --> 00:35:03,340
happy with that he's probably okay we

569
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:05,439
look and we've got the TV test would you

570
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:10,090
be prepared to stand up for national TV

571
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,980
and said I did that thing most

572
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:14,530
politicians aren't that we know exactly

573
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,380
where they quote we will garland their

574
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:20,500
ethics paid only person and it seems

575
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:28,170
like the Hicklin a little like anyone

576
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:34,180
there that's all so the smell test

577
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:36,430
this smells of this thing yeah it was

578
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:39,640
like talking that you know

579
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:43,500
it's not quite happy about it you're not

580
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:49,240
comfortable don't does something wrong

581
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:52,809
maybe 2/10 will do and the other

582
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:57,459
person's shoes test which really think

583
00:35:52,809 --> 00:36:00,030
people yells choose tranquil run but it

584
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:02,530
means that this thing that you're doing

585
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:08,740
would you be happy if someone else is

586
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:10,630
doing it to you on its head if you have

587
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:14,979
if you'd be happy for this thing to be

588
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:16,410
done to you then go ahead and do it

589
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,920
[Music]

590
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:24,420
and of course there's a market test

591
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:27,520
would you buy a used car from this man

592
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:33,130
took your dick in insulin for one person

593
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:37,509
United States of Durham's head so how do

594
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:42,579
we feel about keeping our homes do we

595
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:47,040
get either guilt or conscience it's

596
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:49,720
necessary to conform tomorrow standards

597
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,540
kicks in when someone pelted it up to

598
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,250
boot standards Twitter is a prime

599
00:36:52,540 --> 00:37:00,609
example you said the whole thing on

600
00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:02,710
there and boy do you know about it it's

601
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:05,348
an unpleasant feeling which motivates

602
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:08,069
you provided by doing something a bit

603
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:11,530
better next time

604
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:13,240
conscience is internal guilt can be

605
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:15,210
external and what else turns around and

606
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,609
says you did something wrong you may

607
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:19,740
stop and consider it right did I do

608
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:23,348
something wrong

609
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:28,029
even in do you think that it can get too

610
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:32,770
much thus the soul what cancer does the

611
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:36,910
body's is away not a good thing but

612
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:40,329
there's too much individual start hi

613
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:42,609
what they're doing it become insulated

614
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:44,410
they may be become quite comfortable

615
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:46,549
with it so well yeah yeah but our

616
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:50,779
backboard everybody says so

617
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:55,010
so simple so I am that's what I am they

618
00:37:50,780 --> 00:38:04,030
made a little care but they mold live

619
00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:10,130
outside the system altogether so

620
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:13,010
impaired intention without them it's not

621
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:14,750
that offensive little love because I

622
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:19,190
didn't mean it to the offense it just

623
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:22,820
was so chance to take offense to it very

624
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:25,880
easy one to go bandage you forget some

625

polls Thank You sample cell is genuine

626

they're upset you didn't mean it's a

627
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:40,180
temptation for socialism I'm responsible

talk our actions ourselves based on our

634
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:13,070
own standards that's why we need to have

635
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:16,190
some standards based on content here

636
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:17,600
needs to know me it's an inner voice

637

time texting the water seeing both you

663
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:19,990
have to take a really big slide unless I

664
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:23,330
see a positive advantage there's well

665
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:26,890
environmental campaigns about all that

666
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:31,220
very strong is it not constantly food

667
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:33,020
and so they to the divan teams and

668
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,240
companies will look at that they well

669
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:39,470
that would be nice that it stands

670
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:42,470
postures and it might make things harder

671
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:46,549
with example message messing about the

672
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:48,950
plastic bags and the any one hand device

673
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:53,030
hope you could think Thomas Carey back

674
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:55,040
to the endowment but it's causing quite

675
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,130
a lot of problems and things like um

676
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:03,020
shopping and I remember many

677
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:04,790
supermarkets not on the plastic box but

678
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,910
your shopping implant packages comes to

679
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:09,650
the Train and this

680
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:12,828
jumping around all step back pick up all

681
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:17,089
your stuff you so much easier to pick us

682
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:19,430
up in several bags so doctors stepping

683
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:24,440
back for life but also in aesthetic to

684
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:28,520
in developing ones well usually why one

685
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:31,309
but companies should be looking at what

686
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,740
the last of these bumps would be they

687
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:35,869
may be taking baby steps which it's in

688
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:40,399
the eyes of Duke on campaigning or

689
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:43,660
whatever the subject is demand faster

690
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,220
action more than us about you

691
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:48,618
there's so many factors going on with

692
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:50,740
that's why I think get that when you go

693
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:54,470
together

694
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:58,089
yeah another matter

695
00:42:54,470 --> 00:43:03,049
I've had by those three

696
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:03,050
